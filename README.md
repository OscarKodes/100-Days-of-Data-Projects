# 100 Days of Data Projects

This is a daily goal where I will work on data projects for 100 days. 

The purpose is to practice data analysis, machine learning, creating dashboards, and communicating data insights to a general audience.

I aim to do at least one of the following each day:

- Data collection/scraping

- Data cleaning and preparation

- Exploratory Data Analysis

- Machine Learning (supervised/unsupervised)

- Dashboard visualization

- Video presentation of analysis

### Day 1 - June 30th, 2022

**Tasks Done**

- Decided on two research topics

	- Classification: Given a Pokemon's features of base stats, experience requirements, catch rate, height, weight, and generation number, could we reliably classify if a Pokemon is a Dragon Type?
	
	- Regression: Can we create a regression model that predicts a Pokemon's HP stat?

- Cleaned and prepared Pokemon data

    - Removed Mega evolutions because they might have different stats

	- Standardized continuous variables
	
	- One-hot encoded catgorical variables
