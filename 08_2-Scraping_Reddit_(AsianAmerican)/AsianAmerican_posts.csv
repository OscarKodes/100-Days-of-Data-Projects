14,It angers me that racism against Chinese people is so normalized,865,v8k0p1,asianamerican,https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/v8k0p1/it_angers_me_that_racism_against_chinese_people/,317,"Every time there is any mention of China on social media, anywhere, a majority -- if not all -- of the comments are racist. And no one seems to have a problem with it. Where are all the progressive activists then? Where are all the people who supposedly ""hate racism""? 

It seems like some Asian people don't even recognize that there's something wrong. Racism against every other minority seems to get called out, but EVERYONE hates Chinese people. 

People also often make exceedingly racist remarks under the guise of hating China. I don't even understand why the fuck everyone hates Chinese people so much and how there can be so much hate, and NOT ONE PERSON tries to combat this. Even posts that are completely unrelated to China, like some random Asian kid performing a cool activity, always receive tons of hate comments about how that Asian kid must get abused, and how China enslaves their people and Asians are good at everything just because we are robots who don't know how to have fun.

Like...are you guys seeing this shit? I am Chinese American and it appalls me how much fucking NORMALIZED anti-Chinese racism exists in the United States and even in other countries. It is not even the racism that is shocking, because go figure, but the fact that there is ZERO recognition that this is actually racism.

I have never seen anyone who isn't Asian actually acknowledge anti-Asian racism. I hate seeing all these stupid self-identifying ""progressives"" who would never say a word if they saw an old Asian grandmother getting beat up right in front of them.

31,Stop sexualizing me for being Japanese.,762,hbld3u,asianamerican,https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/hbld3u/stop_sexualizing_me_for_being_japanese/,173,"Hi, I‚Äôm new to this subreddit. I hope this is the right place for me to post this, but lately I‚Äôve been feeling like I need to say this on behalf of myself, and for any other japanese/asian american women that have also dealt with this. There‚Äôs not enough said on this matter. 

I‚Äôm a 5th generation 100% Japanese American. My first and only language is english. I have never been to Japan, nor do I have any ties to Japanese culture besides knowing a few slang words that my great-grandparents used. 

All my life that I can remember, I can remember men/guys asking me if i‚Äôm Japanese. After responding yes, I always get ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to date a Japanese girl.‚Äù ‚ÄúJapanese girls are cute.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never fucked a japanese girl before.‚Äù ‚ÄúCan you teach me japanese?‚Äù ‚Äútake me back to japan with you next time you go back‚Äù (or something creepy along those lines) This happens anywhere I go, especially while I‚Äôm working so I can‚Äôt make a big fuss!! I understand that this doesn‚Äôt seem like too much, but after hearing it for years and years and feeling like my ethnicity is just someone‚Äôs fetish, it makes me sick. There are times where I‚Äôll even lie and tell people I‚Äôm chinese or korean to get them to back off, and it actually works, which goes to show that i‚Äôm solely being fetishized for being Japanese which disgusts me. 

For some reason people think it‚Äôs okay to sexualize me and say it to my face because I‚Äôm Japanese. Think about it, wouldn‚Äôt it be considered super rude and weird for someone to go up to an african american person and ask if they‚Äôre specifically west-african?? and say how much they love fucking only west-african girls??? Or proceed to ask the girl to teach them to be like a west-african?????? and then be disinterested because the girl‚Äôs actually east-african? Its fucking racist and rude to me. 

Why is Japanese it‚Äôs own separate category from asian on porn sites?? Why is it ALWAYS trending where I live? Why is it that when I used dating sites, the first question was always asking me about being japanese? Why do people justify it by saying it‚Äôs their preference not a fetish? If it were truly just preference, you wouldn‚Äôt be sexualizing me to my face and treating me like i‚Äôm not even a human because I‚Äôm japanese. 

edit: sorry i should mention that the porn thing mostly bothers me because i know a lot of people who would rather watch CENSORED japanese porn rather than just uncensored normal porn just because it‚Äôs japanese. 

I never had the courage to speak out on this until now because I was sexually assaulted because of it. Because someone felt like it was ok to sexualize me for being japanese and act out on it without my consent. Because ‚ÄúJapanese women are crazy hot.‚Äù That‚Äôs what they told me before it happened. I kept saying no, but apparently that‚Äôs part of what makes Japanese women hot. 

I felt like I would be patronized for being silly and picky about how men treated me because ‚Äúother races have it worse‚Äù. Now I feel like I NEED to speak up on it because I would never ever wish this upon another woman. Thanks for reading, sorry if this is a lot and hard to understand because of my emotions.

**edit: sorry i realized that some people might be taking this in the sense that i‚Äôm directing this article towards the asian community... I‚Äôm not! I just posted in this subreddit because i know many other asian americans deal with similar struggles. NOT because i‚Äôm directing this post towards asian americans. I‚Äôm directing it to those with yellow fever/japan fetishes.",1592509077.0

I don't know if my message will be seen by a lot of members of if it will get attention but that's not the point, I just wanted to share an experience that happened to me today and which left me with a feeling of injustice and anger.

I'm French but I am from Japanese origins, I grew up having 2 cultures which I'm VERY proud of, but growing in France as an Asian kid wasn't easy every day. Kids here do not necessarily understand the difference and when growing up I've always met people that did misplaced jokes to me or had inappropriate behaviour, sometimes they weren't acting in a bad intentions but sometime things people can tell you can hurt you and make you feel very bad. But I never got angry or reacted because they were just not worth it. 

But these day I feel like there is some sort of anger towards Asian people, all over the world and in France as well, something that isn't justified. 

Today I was walking in a busy street in France, as the government required everyone outside to wear a face mask, I wore one. But for some reasons I got stoped by some police agents that were willing to fine me, giving me very condescending looks and stating that I wasn't wearing my mask when walking (which was not true), when I ask why they arrested me even though I did nothing wrong they just replied by saying ''well you're just unlucky, it had to be you'' but what left a feeling of injustice is that people (non Asian) were walking near me without mask and not even one of the police agent stoped them or even just asked them to put it back. They didn't say anything misplaced but the looks they gave me reminded me the look kids gave me when they were mocking me when I was younger, it really left me with an anger that took some time to dissipate.",1616623222.0

Not gonna happen!‚Äù,578,2y8xno,asianamerican,https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/2y8xno/tv_producer_asian_guys_in_my_show_not_gonna_happen/,225,"**My first-hand account on how media continues to fetishize Asian women, ridicule and neglect Asian men.**

This morning I sat in a boardroom meeting with TV executives and producers to hear about their new live action kids show ‚ÄúMake It Pop‚Äù, a K-pop (Korean pop) inspired musical comedy. I was excited to hear Asian culture was beginning to influence the western mainstream, and when they told me two out of the three main female leads were Asian girls (a Korean and a Chinese Malaysian), I was delighted... that was, until I found out the show had no Asian guys in them. Surprise (not really): only white guys are in the show as the love interests for the Asian girls.

After the producer's presentation, during the Q&A, I mustered up the courage to ask ""Will there be an Asian guy in it""? In a joking manner, the producer said ""Nope! Never! Asian guys in my show, not gonna happen!‚Äù, while everyone else--albeit uncomfortably--laughed it off. Come on now, it's a show about Korean pop. Half the artists from the K-pop industry are Asian men. Most K-pop fans are actually non-Asian girls / women who are a fan of K-pop men. Excluding Asian men in K-pop is like going to Hooters without scantily clad waitresses - nobody wins. The producer began to answer the question seriously and said he was hoping to get PSY to play the father of the main Korean girl. Mentally, I was shaking my head in disappointment.

Another comedic Asian goofball as the only thing to represent Asian men - what a great message we are sending to the Asian girls in our society - that your brother, cousin, father, and your Asian guy friends, are all just laughingstock, unattractive clowns who aren't good enough for you, are incompetent, aren't manly, and completely incapable of love, romance, attraction, being bad ass or cool.

We see these messages, the unattractive and emasculated images, and the omittance of Asian men, repeated time and time again in the media like:

* 21 (Real life story of Asian MIT students are replaced with white actors)

* Romeo Must Die (Romeo and Juliet story except Jet Li doesn‚Äôt even kiss Aaliyah)

* The Forbidden Kingdom (only a white guy can save China and the Asian girl from evil)

* The Wolverine (every Asian guy is useless and dies)

* Full Metal Jacket (me so horny me love you long time)

* The Last Airbender (all the ethnic heroes are replaced with white people, but the villains remain ethnic)

* The Man With The Iron Fists (all Asian women are sexualized whores)

* The Last Samurai (a white guy goes to Japan, kills your brother in law, sleeps with your sister, and beats your best friend in a sword fight after only training for a few months, and saves Japan)

* 47 Ronin (only a mixed Asian born from a white father can save the princess, the other 47 ronin are apparently useless)

* Red Dawn (Chinese are evil, but they actually watch Hollywood movies so let‚Äôs make them North Korean instead)

* Dragonball Evolution (Let‚Äôs make Goku a white guy but keep the Asian girl in it)

* Pacific Rim (only a white guy can save the world and protect those poor helpless Asians and save that Asian girl from distress, Asian guys are useless and they die)

* Iron Man (The Mandarin is a wimp instead of a bad ass villain)

* The Hangover (Asian penis jokes in the 21st century, how mature)

* Sixteen Candles (Long Duk Dong, the emasculated Asian nerd who is the laughing stock of his whole generation)

* Breakfast At Tiffany's (that old stupid looking bucktoothed angry Asian man played in Yellowface)

* Entourage (Lloyd, the gay fat comedic Asian)

* 2 Broke Girls (another fat Asian nerd character)

* And of course most recently The Interview (white guys go to poor Asian country to make fun of / kill Asian guys while having sex with Asian women, while the supreme leader of North Korea is actually another emasculated idiot who secretly dreams of being American but is also useless and dies).

I could go on and list more examples, but that would likely be longer than The Lord of the Rings and the Harry Potter books combined and not nearly as entertaining, so I‚Äôll stop there.

After the meeting, a Korean woman in the company jokingly asked me if I was trying to create a role for myself. I began to explain to her that there's an imbalance in mainstream media when it comes to Asian representation. She agreed, there were only Asian girls, no Asian guys. I asked if she had a son, she said yes. I said, wouldn't you want your son to grow up and have positive role models in the media? She agreed. I too, would want that for my children. The other managers who overheard my conversation quietly agreed and said I had the best question in the Q&A session.

In retrospect, maybe I should have been more offended than I initially was (I was the only Asian person / Asian guy in the whole room). Could you imagine if I was a black man and he said ‚ÄúNope! Never! Black guys in my show, not gonna happen!‚Äù? That probably wouldn‚Äôt have ended well. Which proves my understanding that Asians are the only ethnicity that can still be openly mocked, joked about, and ridiculed in the media and even in public with no repercussions.

But alas, now we'll have another new show, where a new generation of little Asian girls growing up will buy into the fetishized objectified image of themselves portrayed in these shows, and buy into the idea that they can be Asian and cool, but only if it serves the fantasies of white men. Last I recall, Korean pop culture was not invented and owned by white guys. But after watching the [promo trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ28BF7bauI) for this show, that definitely seems to be the case.

The next generation of Asian boys will be left out once again, creating the angry, bitter, frustrated men you see here in today's world, neglected out of love and affection from society (and even from women of their own ethnicity) - and its not because they're incapable of being a man - it's because everyone in society has already pre-judged what their image / idea of an Asian guy is without ever meeting one. The media has already defined Asian men for them. Consequentially, these Asian men grow up to believe in Hollywood's brainwashing, and that is where the racial self-hate, low self esteem, social awkwardness, passivity, and negativity comes from. In the most extreme cases, you get psychos who start picking up a gun or knife and mass murdering innocent people because they feel neglected from society.

Thankfully, I am not one of these men, as I grew up with strong male role models in my brother and father. But I see a lot of people out there who are less fortunate and have become victims of this massive Hollywood brainwashing - and this is why I chose to speak up about it. Some may be quick to call this a whiny rant, but if you can take a moment of your time to use the internet to look up and watch the films and television shows I‚Äôve cited, you‚Äôll find there‚Äôs more than enough evidence to support my claims. Sometimes the truth is uncomfortable, and not many will notice these things, and even less will choose to speak up about them. If I have to be labeled as a ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù for speaking up about them, in hopes to raise awareness about these issues to help others realize the bias and damaging effects of the media, then so be it.

This is a mild vent post I guess, before I take a nap for my headache.

It makes me really sad to see the way Asian issues are downplayed on Twitter. There is so much gaslighting about what Asian people go through, mostly from other minority groups. That we don‚Äôt have it ‚Äúas bad‚Äù as others, that we should be grateful for being ‚Äúpractically white,‚Äù or that it‚Äôs time for us to finally learn what real oppression feels like.

I hardly ever see actual Asian people speaking out about Asians being victims of hate and violence. It‚Äôs always drowned out by non-Asian people saying we don‚Äôt deserve any help because ‚ÄúAsians are racist‚Äù or ‚Äúbut what about the CCP‚Äù, which is racist in itself. 

I‚Äôve pretty much given up on believing Asians will escape the model minority status. It really feels like no one cares about us, and when Asian people do speak up instead of staying quiet like usual, other minority groups tell us to keep quiet or question why we think we deserve any help or sympathy. Growing up, I didn‚Äôt understand why Asians tended to stick with other Asians, but I do now.

I know [this article](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/asian-american-im-tired-being-213057150.html) is already on this subreddit, but it‚Äôs a good read if you haven‚Äôt seen it yet. It explains the gaslighting way better than I ever could. I just wish it was all better. I‚Äôm trying to educate my non-Asian friends at least, but I don‚Äôt have the heart to speak up against everyone else.

Edit: Hey all, thank you for taking the time to read my vent and share your thoughts and experiences with me. I read every single comment. I wanted to just mention before I sleep that although my vent ended on a pessimistic note, I truly do hope and believe that the Asian community can have better relations with other minorities, and we can all work together to tackle the universal problem of white supremacy. It is the reason why we gained the model minority status after all.

The purpose of this vent isn‚Äôt to further any racial tensions or division, but rather the complete opposite. I am of the belief that progress always begins with a conversation. It‚Äôs disingenuous to act like there aren‚Äôt any detractors to our cause, but at the same time, it is important to remember those who support and raise up our voices as well. We are all tired, but we have to be careful about letting ourselves slip further into the disconnect we have with other minority groups.

My wife and I have decided to leave NYC last night. **Curious to hear -- are there others out there who have made this decision solely based on the rising anti-Asian violence in the city?** Sharing a bit of our own reasoning why below for those interested.

\---

First of all, we freaking loved NYC pre-pandemic! We loved our jobs, our diverse groups of friends and colleagues, the food, broadway, and so much more! We're both Asian Americans from Hawaii and have lived here for over 8 years. We felt safe, secure, and excited to live in this amazing city.

That all changed when the COVID-19 pandemic happened and hate crimes started against Asian people started becoming more violent and more widespread on media outlets. Luckily, my job has been accomodating with my safety concerns and I'm allowed to work from home on most days (1-2 days/wk I go into the office now). My wife, however, got the short end of the stick and is being forced to come into the office when she could do her entire job online (shoutout /r/antiwork).

Plenty of Asian womxn I know have opted to take Ubers/Lyfts to/from work and incur significant costs on themselves personally in order to continue to work in the city. For those in the tech/finance industries, their companies compensate them back for this expense -- but both of our employers are not able to support that lifestyle (nor do we expect them to). Our subway commute lasts roughly an hour and we're constantly exposed to people experiencing homelessness and people who (we assume) have mental illnesses on the subways and in the streets.

My wife is terrified to the point where she needs to mentally and physically prepare to exit our apartment to go to work (she is also in therapy now as a result of this). With everything just this year from Michelle Go, Christina Lee, and the Asian woman who was just recently attacked on Friday in Yonkers -- we have seriously had enough and we've decided to quit our jobs and move home. We know there are plenty of people out there who will judge us for this decision and call us cowards (we've already been called that and worse for even saying we're scared), but we're not regretting this decision.

Thanks for reading, and hope to hear others' stories if there are any out there.

It is now okay for these closeted racists to go after asians. Idk what to do with this information per say, but it is something the asian community has to understand. We have to understand pr control, brand image, and collaborating with asians. Anti-asian propaganda needs to be eliminated, and  a better narrative needs to be told and managed.

The only asian american community I have seen do this so far are the korean-americans. The asian american community thinking we don't need to form a tighter unified asian american community may be wrong.

134,"Mini rant/PSA: Chinese Americans need other Asian Americans to stick up for us, not throw us under the bus",518,ol25b3,asianamerican,https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/ol25b3/mini_rantpsa_chinese_americans_need_other_asian/,124,"Idk if this post has been made before, I just joined Reddit. But this has been bugging me for a really long time and I want to bring it up somewhere

I feel like Chinese Americans are probably the most hated Asian group in America right now. And I'm not talking about post-COVID America... it's been this way for most of the time that Asians have been in America (except maybe WWII and the Vietnam War). I think this is partially because we're the largest Asian group, but imo it's mainly because China has always been seen as this backwards, enemy state that's the antithesis to the West. And since the collapse of the Soviet Union, China has been seen as our #1 biggest enemy 

The most frustrating part though is that I hear Asian Americans of other backgrounds echoing the same xenophobic rhetoric about Chinese people that I hear from racists. This includes Taiwanese and Hkers when they talk about mainland Chinese btw. You guys know what I'm talking about... people responding to anti-Asian sentiment by being like ""oh that's Chinese people, not my ethnic group."" 

I've heard on in the news, from clowns like Sery Kim, and throughout my everyday life, like a Japanese American classmate taunting me and calling me a dirty communist, or this Korean international student at college who told me she thought I was ""too pretty to be Chinese,"" or my Korean friend's parents who said they don't like having Chinese clients because Chinese people are dirty. In fact, my mom said the first person to call her a racial slur after she came to the US was a Southeast Asian woman (you can probably guess which slur it is)

I understand that there's some complicated history between different Asian groups in the motherland, but I feel like if you carry over this mentality to America and direct hatred towards other Asian groups, you're not just hurting people from that Asian group -- you're hurting all of us. Cause in the US, we're all Asian American. Outsiders don't make the distinction. At least after COVID, it's really opened up many peoples' eyes regarding how we're all inherently connected to each other in this country, regardless of how we feel about it. 

Also I just want to add, since apparently lots of people think this, not all Chinese people are communist spies and extensions of the CPC. In fact, the Chinese community in the US has always been traditionally anti-communist. Go to any Chinatown and you'll always see overwhelmingly more ROC flags flying than PRC (in fact I don't think I've ever even seen PRC flags at any of the Chinatowns I've been to). We understand why questioning Japanese Americans' loyalty during WWII was wrong, so please extend this same rationale to Chinese Americans now

Also the idea that we're ""privileged Asians"" who are basically ""white adjacent"" (whatever that means) is so wrong. Chinese Americans are extremely diverse -- there's super educated rich Chinese Americans, but there's also plenty of Chinese Americans who are undocumented and/or live below the poverty level. And a whole lot of people in between. Just because you perceive Chinese Americans to all be well-off and privileged doesn't mean we don't need your support when it comes to anti-Chinese rhetoric.

Sorry if I sounded jaded and harsh in this post. I love being Asian American and I love our community, but it really disheartens me to see some other Asians who I thought had my back throwing me under the bus. If another Asian group comes under attack in the future, I will 100% stand by them. Because I strongly believe that being Asian American is it's own distinct identity and I see you all as my people. And also because it's just the right thing to do.

I'm Black and Japanese and I‚Äôve always been proud of it, but have also always gotten hate from both sides for it. I have darker skin and I have been told I am not Asian enough because of it. I've had black people get mad at me for being proud of my Japanese heritage and wanting to visit Japan. With them usually asking me why I don't visit Africa instead, accusing me of not being proud of my blackness, and asking me if I think I'm better than them. Whenever I was attracted to an Asian man I would almost always be rejected because they, ""don't date black girls."" I've gotten ghosted by more than one Asian guy when they saw how dark my skin is. Some would even express disgust that I dared to even flirt with them while looking so obviously black. I have Asian women be afraid of me when I tried to befriend them. I've even been told by people on both sides that I don't get to claim my Asian heritage because, ""Well, you're so dark that you can't even tell."" And, ""You're so dark you know they wouldn't consider you one of them, right?"" It got to the point that I did stop claiming my heritage because they really made me feel like I didn't have a right to, and I just started telling everyone I was black. I‚Äôve always been shocked the few times I‚Äôve had older Asian people approach me and ask me if my mom is Korean or Japanese. I just accepted that because of the way I look I‚Äôm not Hapa or Asian.

Then being met with this recent rise in Asian hate crimes almost immediately after the BLM issues has been truly exhausting. I've wanted to show as much support for anti Asian-hate protests and Asian businesses. I care about Asian causes. I care about Asian people. Yet, I feel like I won't be welcome because of how I look. And because online I've seen more focus on the hate crimes committed by black people than by other races. With many claiming its only black people doing it and using it as an excuse for their already existing anti-black racism. This past year has been really trying time for me. I‚Äôve found myself in tears often recently. Sometimes I just want to give up and hide away from the world.

EDIT: I just wanted to say thank you to everyone for all the kind comments. I was initially afraid to post this at all. Every time I got a reply notification my heart would start pounding, lol. So, while I can't reply to everyone, I do want everyone to know that I've read the comments. And it's wonderful to receive so much support.

158,"had racist slurs thrown at me from a member at Planet Fitness after I politely asked them to mask up. management wants to wait till the NEXT offense to terminate them, what can I do to make that happen before the fact?",504,mlsnzj,asianamerican,https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/mlsnzj/had_racist_slurs_thrown_at_me_from_a_member_at/,128,"didn't know where to post this, other than here, where others would feel this as intimately as i do.

I POLITELY asked a member in the free weights section at PF to put on their mask. I personally don't like to ""tattle"" and figured I would ask directly, before taking it to management. This is how the conversation went.

* Me: \*trying to wave him down to get his attention, while he actively tries to ignore me\* hello, would you mind putting on your mask please?
* Him: Can you see I'm trying to work out here? I put it on in between sets anyway.
* Me: yes, I think that's what we're all doing here, and I don't see you putting it on at all.
* Him: Why don't you mind your own fucking business ? I'm six feet away from you. You don't work here.
* Me: I asked you politely, sir. Do I seriously need to tell someone that you're not wearing your mask?
* Him: why don't you stop harassing me, b\*\*\*\*?
* Me: wow, seriously? \*tells management, and when management looks, member is wearing his gaiter across his mouth, and says he's wearing one. Manager says he'll talk to him if he's not wearing one. I walk back to the weights section, because fuck if I'm letting this guy steal my workout.\*
* Him: \*looking at me through the mirror, shaking his head\* you're fucking pathetic
* Me: \*giving two thumbs up\* well fuck you too
* Him: why don't you go back to china you fucking ch\*\*\*
* Me: what the fuck did you say? did you just seriously say that racist shit?

I tell management, who happens to be a really buff POC, who walks over and starts talking to him. I'm shook, and take a bathroom break to collect myself. I don't want to be there for this. I walk back over to the weight area after, and that guy is still there. I tell myself I'm not going to let him bully me out of a place where I have every right to be. I continue my workout in the free weights section.

He continues glaring at me through the mirror, and across the gym. I used the bathroom again to wash my hands, and I could see he was keeping track of where I was.

On my way out, I checked to make sure he was in the gym and not waiting for me outside. I was legit scared, given all of the horrible, violent crimes that have been occurring throughout the nation. I stop to ask the manager on my way out about this guy. He looked at me annoyed, since he was in a meeting, and I could hear a video going on in the background of his laptop. He says he's keeping an eye on that guy, and that another offense will cause him to be terminated. ANOTHER OFFENSE. he wasn't even asked TO LEAVE. **what if this were to turn violent the next time?** what if another asian woman has to go through this because of this one guy?

why protect him?? he was already breaking the rules. i feel like not wearing a mask constitutes a warning, but racism, aggression, and sexual harassment are grounds for immediate ejection. **if his daughter were afraid when leaving the gym or entering the parking lot, what expectations would he have of that institution?** people like this just need to be held accountable and CANCELLED. i intend on writing an email to the manager to appeal to him, but, after getting the response from PF FB's page, I don't have high hopes.

I briefly described my experience on PF's FB page, on an old thread where they denounce racism, because I found it hypocritical AF. a rep PM'd me and asked me about the situation.. I got this response from their Social Media Team:

>""Here  at Planet Fitness, we always strive to provide a Judgement Free  atmosphere at all of our PF locations. From what we gathered, it sounds  like the manager has his eye on this member and will continue to assess  the situation moving forward. Please do not hesitate to approach the  manager if you suspect that this member is continuing to make you or  others feel uncomfortable.""

weakest fucking response ever. I asked them how they'd act if this was their daughter, and their next response was even worse:

>We'd like to send your request to the management team at your local club. Can you please provide the following information:  1. Name on your Membership Agreement 2. Home Club Location  3. Contact Information (Phone and/or Email)   Thank you!

routing my messages to a manager I just talked to in person is not helpful AT ALL.

So my question to you guys is- **how do I get this member terminated? How the hell do I get justice? Do I just walk away, because I wouldn't feel safe there anyway?** I'm so emotionally drained from all this, and as the victim here, *I wanted to believe that I had allies who would CANCEL this type of behavior,* especially in this political climate. Right now, I feel like I just have to sit down and take it. I joined the gym despite COVID risks, due to my emotional health. I've gone through so many life changes in such a short amount of time, I needed sanctuary. I know this manager probably just sees a young, asian woman with little to no voice. I also understand that just because he's a POC, doesn't mean he empathized with me. I don't know what to do, I feel helpless and ANGRY. I know asian hate has been really prevalent across the US, but I had higher hopes for California.

Like fuck, I was a fan of him but that is some racist bullshit.  He tries to justify it later in the name of comedy but admits it's a cliche and Seinfeld who is always criticising others for bad jokes had to have known he was making at best a bad joke BUT he just didnt give a fuck

*And in the episode with Eddie Murphy, he shows how much he cares about making an offensive joke when he says hes not sure if he can use a joke about how when two homeless people are talking, it looks like one is giving the other advice.  WTF how is that offensive at all and less offensive than calling Asians the same?  But he made the crack about Asians anyway

Even Gervais who as host twice attacked actors at the Golden Globes when he shouldve celebrated them had enough sense to hit the brakes on what Seinfeld said

And though Seinfeld meant it as a dig towards Chinese people, he could have easily been talking about any Asians including Asian Americans

Later they talk about how it's funny until it's your group being criticized but Seinfeld would never make a simliar stereotypical joke about any other race and would be up in arms if it was made about jews

Asians are not fucking doormats or robots just like jews are not all money grubbers",1564071909.0

For example:

1. Labeling West Asians as terrorists. Islam does have its problems with radicalization, but it's ridiculous to imply someone is a terrorist for being Arab-looking. (Sikhs often face ignorance like this in addition to Arabs).
2. I think the perception of South Asians (Indian especially) has improved, but still a lot mockery towards accents, body odor, and standards of living. Indian call enter scams also garner a negative perception of Indians.
3. The idea that Southeast Asian women are easy lays and love white men. White men visiting these countries are typically wealthier than the average male there, but is that really something to brag about? I'm sure a Vietnamese man can be just as wealthy if given the chance to immigrate to the US/Canada/etc. Asian Americans have already been deemed the ""model minority"".
4. This example triggers me the most. Whenever there's a picture/GIF/video of someone who looks East/Southeast Asian involving a dog, there's always some jackass saying it's going to be eaten. These comments appear to be less common when the Asian is female, but it's still fucking stupid. It's as if they don't know the difference between dogs bred for consumption versus dogs that are kept as pets. What message is being sent to Asian dog owners? That they're incapable of *loving* an animal just like everybody else? Also, if these people eat other animals they're fucking hypocrites. Humans literally **farm** animals for consumption, but somehow (a small percentage of) Asians are deemed barbaric for eating dog meat? Lastly, dog meat consumption is already becoming less popular in Asia, and the likelihood of an Asian American/Canadian/Australian, etc. individual consuming dog meat is extremely low.",1546119450.0

You know, the most insulting part about the attacks on elderly Asians is that many were the original generation that decided to leave better lives behind in exchange for better future lives for generations that they‚Äôd never meet. They paid for our futures with their hard work, and this is what they get - a hard shove into cold cement, and a public defender chalking it up to ‚Äúmental distress‚Äù. Fuck your mental distress.

Is it possible that whites are fundamentally incapable of holding a logically consistent worldview?

For example there will often be a highly upvoted comment like: ‚Äúso many people think Japan is this perfect anime land, but it‚Äôs not‚Äù - meanwhile all the comments are talking about issues in Japan. 

Another one is saying Japanese or Koreans are the most racist people in the world. Yes, staring at people on the train is apparently the epitome of racism (I know there are serious incidents though, but the train one is just very commonly said). I don‚Äôt see how Japan or South Korea is more racist that Qatar, Serbia, or Saudi Arabia. Qatar with the treatment of Indian workers especially.

You get the point. There is a reason I think this happens. Have you noticed that Vietnam for example gets praised a lot as being a really nice place? Or Thailand? The reason people don‚Äôt rush to point out issues with Thailand or Vietnam is because they are not a ‚Äúthreat‚Äù. Japan and South Korea are the most developed Asian countries with the highest standard of living. If Vietnam or Thailand develops to the point of Japan or South Korea, they‚Äôll get the same scrutiny.

I'm running for State Representative in Kansas as the Democrat candidate, and if I win, I would be the first Chinese-American to ever serve in the House.",347,8ewt5x,asianamerican,https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/8ewt5x/hi_rasianamerican_im_running_for_state/,46,"Hey y'all!

My name's Rui Xu and to give you a little background on myself, I'm 29 years old and currently a marketing analyst at a non-profit in the Kansas City area.  I was born in Switzerland to Chinese PhD students, but because I was the 2nd child, they thought their future prospects would be brighter here in America rather than China, so I moved here when I was 2 years old.  I grew up in a pretty rural town in Missouri, so I had to learn pretty early on how to deal with jabs at my race or skin color and I essentially landed on ""laugh it off, ignore them, know that you're on the right side of history.""

I naturalized to be a US citizen in the 7th grade (which was literally the only day of school I missed between the 3rd grade and graduation. Tiger moms.)  I went to school in Los Angeles at USC studying economics before moving back to the Midwest.  I worked as a performance analyst at the Major League Soccer team here, Sporting KC, for 3.5 years before moving over to marketing in 2014.

After Trump won in 2016, everything just felt awful all the time and so I decided to jump over to the non-profit world to make myself feel a little bit better, and that's where I've been since this past July!


That same line of thinking is kind of what drew me into this race.  I just couldn't be passive anymore... I had always lived my life by the ""The arc of the moral universe is long, but bends towards justice"" quote with the ASSUMPTION that it was true, but if there's anything I've learned over the last 2 years, it's that it takes people fighting for that to be true. It doesn't just happen.

I remember really specifically one moment about two weeks before the election.  I was at the bar with some friends and went to the bathroom.  Two drunk guys walked in and started calling me ""Bruce Lee"" and ""Jackie Chan"" and I did what I've always done. Laughed it off, ignored them. Assumed I was on the right side of history.  But then Trump won and I immediately thought back to that... what if I confronted them?  Then they know that I think what they're doing isn't cool, and maybe they stop. Then maybe when a Presidential candidate uses similar language, they know that's not right either, and then maybe they don't vote for him.  How many moments like this happened in my life where I could've changed someone else's ideas on what it meant to be Asian American in this country?

So fast forward, and the last week of this February, I found out that the Republican incumbent in my district (which is pretty progressive! Hillary won by 25 points, so this is a VERY winnable race) was running unopposed, and I wasn't going to just let that happen anymore. Not in my district, not in this year. Not if I could do anything about it. So that's why I'm here!

I'm posting here because since I've announced that I'm running, the Asian American community has been really amazing for me in my small circles.  My dad posted my website in one of his WeChat group chats, and it immediately spread in one day all over the country, and I was getting donations from Chinese people everywhere.

I'm running on a progressive platform based around on the idea of trust.  I think one of the biggest problems that our government has is that for the most part, people don't really trust their elected officials.  If we elect people that we actually trust, then the government can go back to being an idea that's force for good and positive impacts!  I support Medicaid Expansion here in Kansas, fully funding our public schools, supporting Net Neutrality, and being good stewards for this earth.  

**If you feel like you want to help, there are two really really helpful things you can do!
**
1) Donate!  My Republican opponent has a HUGE treasure chest that she's just been sitting on, and I'm trying to compete without taking any corporate PAC money so I've been relying on smaller donations from a bunch of people.  If everyone here who sees this just donates $25 (or more, I'll definitely take more...) then I can put together a really strong campaign plan.

https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ruixu

2) Spread the word!!  Like I alluded to, just by my dad spreading my website to his network, and those people spreading my website to their networks, I was able to reach a huge group of people that have been able and willing to help!  I think people have been really excited about the idea of seeing more Asian-Americans in leadership roles... I know that that's something I missed a lot when I was younger.  In fact, when the campaign gets stressful sometimes, I just sit down and tell myself to ""be the role model that an 8-year-old Rui would have needed"" and that's done a great job of keeping me going.

The article was revised once before being taken down altogether, and I can only take [screenshots of the revised, already less offensive version](https://imgur.com/a/Qe5iObA), but the original was even nastier, opening with this choice passage: 

> ""That's right: Nicholas Jonas married into a fraudulent relationship against his will this past Sunday, December 1, and I'll tell you why I think so,"" Smith wrote. ""All Nick wanted was a possible fling with Hollywood's latest It Woman, but instead he wound up staring straight at a life sentence with a global scam artist.""

and ending with [this unbelievably xenophobic passage](https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/bodyeditor/201812/p-19-x1280.jpeg?RRucEYB4guAM6OGVamhE1QGl7Q9Ue9Q0) about ""the tradition of a baraat, a festive wedding processional in which the groom, accompanied by his family and friends, rides to the ceremony on a horse.""

According to Prachi Gupta at [Jezebel](https://jezebel.com/priyanka-chopra-isnt-a-scammer-her-fame-just-stumps-ma-1830880335): 
> The original version of the essay is not archived. But the gist was this: After Chopra, portrayed as a cold, fame-obsessed foreigner, established herself in India, she set her sights on success in America. **Part of Chopra‚Äôs ticket to the top? A white man.** Tom Hiddleston didn‚Äôt make the cut, so, the piece alleged, Chopra‚Äôs team landed on Jonas. It also suggested that contrary to the couple‚Äôs story about DMing each other on social media, Chopra‚Äôs team arranged a meeting between the two of them, and painted Jonas as Chopra‚Äôs victim: ‚ÄúAll Nick wanted was a possible fling with Hollywood‚Äôs latest It Woman, but instead he wound up staring straight at a life sentence with a global scam artist.‚Äù

> Chopra‚Äôs ‚Äúscam‚Äù seems to be that she‚Äôs an older woman, comes from India, snagged a famous man, and then thrust a suspiciously elaborate, multi-day wedding upon him (which is just the way Indian weddings... are).

> The piece also belies an ignorance over Indian customs and traditions. It acknowledged Chopra as a brown Indian woman, yet hoisted upon her the rules and expectations of Western customs. It is written skeptically of both the multi-day affair that characterizes all traditional Hindu weddings, and the fast nature of their engagement. But in India, where arranged marriages are common and engagements are relatively short, Chopra‚Äôs decision isn‚Äôt particularly noteworthy (her own parents were engaged 10 days after meeting each other). 

Priyanka was also criticized for doing the same things that most American celebrities do (doing a pre-wedding photoshoot for Vogue, wearing custom made designer gowns, working with big brands, having a team run her social media, having a lavish, expensive wedding, being wealthy and enjoying it), but it's extra suspicious because she's Indian!! and her wedding is so Indian!! and over the top!! How absurd that this multi-millionairess and global celebrity needs to use a white man like Nick Jonas (who??) for fame and money? Does her Bollywood fame and successes not count because it's Bollywood? The Prime Minister of India attended this wedding, and it sure wasn't because of Nick Jonas.

It's basically a (racist & xenophobic) tale of how this foreign Indian woman must be a greedy schemer, scamming a naive, innocent, precious white man into a ""life sentence"" of a marriage, even though according to every account, he was the one who pursued her, and she's rich, hot, talented and famous in her own right and frankly, way out of Nick Jonas' league. This article would have never been written about a white woman in the same circumstances.",1544039222.0

This guy proceeded to then tell me that he's super liberal, attended BLM marches, and is super sad about the racism towards Asians... yet feels that it's okay to double down and say that cheating and stealing is a core part of Chinese culture because of his own personal experience and anecdotes.

That said, we as a community need to be able to decouple the violent actions of a homeless individual with mental illness from the Black community at large. Remember that in the wake of the Virginia Tech shootings, Koreans from all corners of the globe felt the bizarre need to apologize for Seung-Hui Cho's actions, which others in the Asian American community quickly [shut down](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/19/AR2007041902942.html), and rightly so.

Tensions between Black and Asian American communities obviously exist and need to be addressed. There are groups out there doing that work, as well as mixed race families, friend groups, and entire communities where regular coexistence with all the volatility of daily interaction across difference is the mundane reality of life. We've seen the [statistics](https://virulenthate.org/reports/), which show that the overwhelming majority of perpetrators are white, and yet I never see the same level of calls for accountability from white America, even though the past half decade has clearly shown these people's level of naked self interest in maintaining white supremacist power structures up until the moment that someone like Trump threatens their own way of life. Some of y'all need to take a long, hard look at your social circles and the culture of white supremacy that you've bought into while assimilating into your cloistered little bubbles of white culture and question why you're hyperfixating on the Black community.

ETA for anyone with issues with the study by Borja and Gibson:

[FBI Hate Crime Statistics for 2020](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/anti-asian-hate-crimes-rose-73-last-year-updated-fbi-data-says-rcna3741): 55% of offenders in all hate crime cases were white. [52%](https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/pages/explorer/crime/hate-crime) in anti-Asian bias incidents. Same dashboard shows that hate crimes against Black people far outstrip those against any other group. So why is it that anti-Asian hate crimes involving Black people always lead to comments like those found in [this thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/s53us1/i_know_many_asian_women_like_me_are_exhausted/), while nobody is holding white people and community leaders to the same standard in the wake of hate crimes that are just as violent, or [worse](https://np.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/m6naqx/someone_targeted_asian_massage_parlors_7_dead_in/)? Plenty of ""of course he was taken alive"" in that thread, but no calls for White people to hold their own accountable.

And the author, who is a brown PoC was like, ‚ÄúOh AAPH are included in the brown part‚Äù.

I wouldn‚Äôt be able to suspend disbelief to really get into whatever world the movie was trying to create because whatever role Mark Wahlberg will ever play will  always be a racist character to me.  Affable man talking to a stuffed teddy? Affable racist man talking to an equally racist teddy bear.  Cool action hero star ? Also, definitely a racist action hero star who will probably beat me to death to save a white person.

And then I started noticing how many movies Mark Wahlberg has been in and it started getting to me how popular he is. Amazon has 132 titles with him in them. Netflix comes up with 300 films related to Mark Wahlberg. He‚Äôs everywhere. But where I got really in my feelings was googling his name and I had to dig deep into articles or links to read about his actual hate crimes. His Wiki page only mentions his racism all the way at the bottom under ‚ÄúLegal issues‚Äù. And his page is Wiki protected so public can‚Äôt edit. BUT,  from his Wiki page:

Wahlberg and three friends chased after three black children while yelling ‚ÄòKill the n--, kill the n‚Äî' and throwing rocks at them. The next day, Wahlberg and others followed a group of mostly black fourth graders (including one of the victims from the previous day) taking a field trip on a beach, yelled racial epithets at them, threw rocks at them, and ‚Äòsummoned other white males who joined‚Äô in the harassment.

Also: Wahlberg  assaulted a middle aged Vietnamese-American man on the street, calling him a ‚ÄòVietnam fucking shit‚Äô and knocking him unconscious with a large wooden stick. Wahlberg attached a second Vietnamese-American man later the same day, punching him in the eye\[‚Ä¶  \] Investigators also noted that Wahlberg ‚Äòmade numerous unsolicited racial statements about ‚Äòg‚Äîks‚Äô and ‚Äòslant-eyed g‚Äîks‚Äô. 

YOU CAN‚ÄôT SANITIZE YOUR HATE MARK WAHLBERG. You stalked CHILDREN and incited a white mob against their entire class. You beat a convenience store clerk almost to death because he wouldn‚Äôt let you steal his beer; you made a man hide you from police and then you assaulted him for it. My parents warned me about people like you my whole life, and I refuse to watch you prance around with a gun in movies.

I dunno know if his brothers are also racist pieces of shit, but I know their family series that has been running for TEN seasons and has TWO Emmys. Not to mention he married the idiot who started the anti-vax stupidity.  And in case anyone asks, I‚Äôll be skipping Simu Liu‚Äôs new movie with Marky Mark too.",1619299236.0

Unsurprisingly, I‚Äôve seen a lot of people blame Africans, the LGBTQ community, and even conspiracy theories (Bill gates, China, and bioweapon). 

I think we all remember the news coverage over COVID-19 in 2019 and 2020 and all the racist remarks being justified because ‚Äúit‚Äôs a fact that it originated in China.‚Äù I‚Äôm not saying that we should blame Europeans/White people for this outbreak of monkeypox, but I do think it‚Äôs interesting how society reacts when an outbreak originates in/mainly affects the West. It‚Äôs like people (white people especially) can not believe that a disease would originate in the civilized west as diseases can only originate in dirty Asia and Africa (satirical, obviously).

Going into the future, I hope that humanity can stop blaming each other for where a disease/epidemic originates.

(I can understand most of it, and ask basic questions‚Ä¶I think.) She asks if I speak to my kid in Chinese regularly because he doesn‚Äôt seem to understand much, and I sheepishly explain (in probably first grade level Chinese) that I‚Äôve been having trouble getting him to listen to me at all, so I often resort to English at home.

I ask my mom what Chinese holidays to give the teachers a gift or nice note. What to write in those notes. And how many mooncakes and what kind would be an appropriate gift.

I‚Äôve been trying to relearn Chinese using the HelloChinese app, and hoping I can keep up with my kid. I get sent videos of the teachers reading stories to the kids and I barely understand The Three Little Pigs. 

The other (mostly Chinese) parents want to meet up for Mid Autumn Festival and do traditional stuff like have kids run around with lanterns at a park. So, I‚Äôve never done this. What kind of lanterns do you use for it?? I feel like a bit of an imposter among them.

And on top of it all, my partner isn‚Äôt Asian so I have to play a terribly unqualified translator and cultural interpreter. 

Anyway, I thought I was over the ‚Äúbanana‚Äù feelings. But I guess this is what we do so our kid can talk to his YeYe and NaiNai and maybe someday feel more comfortable than I do putting Mandarin down on his resume.

Any other parents relate?",1631816034.0

I worked in San Jose and these three businesses are in very diverse and working class areas. I could have seen something like this in less diverse places in the Bay or even other parts of San Jose but this is pretty surprising.

If there is one positive from this it's that these are all spots that are very popular with the younger crowd so hopefully it serves as a wake up call for everyone to be aware of the unfortunately world we're living in as Asian Americans.

She complained it was gross and she doesn‚Äôt like how you can see the raw meat. She also said she doesn‚Äôt see the point in going to a restaurant to cook things yourself. Fast forward to 3 months later we are trying a new fondue place. Everything comes raw including the meat and you cook it yourself at the table. She said it was amazing and a fun experience. Suddenly, it‚Äôs not gross. Whenever I mention something Asian or she hears kpop, she makes a grossed out face. I want to call her out on it but at the same time she will deny everything.

Edit: Hi guys, thank you for all your insight! Since a lot of people have been asking, she is black. She specifically said it was the raw meat and cooking the food yourself that she didn't like about hotpot/kbbq. It wasn't about the spices, seasoning, or flavor. It's hard to drop her as a friend because we are a friend group of 4 and we all hang out together. I also want to find out more if this was racially-motivated. Perhaps she didn't like the atmosphere of the hotpot/bbq place as the restaurant was louder, more crowded, and they don't explain anything or help you cut up the meat. The fondue place was quieter, more intimate, and the waitress explained how to do everything.

But again, there are also instances where I do think she is being racist or at least ignorant. For example, she's hinted that she thinks Asian men are ugly as a whole, she says ""why do ya'll people..."" when she is talking to me about what other Asians do, and she just learned the word ""chink"" is a slur. She was using it before to describe slanted eyes and didn't know it was a bad word. I think she's trying to be better because she stopped saying it and she also went with me to see Everything Everywhere All At Once. I told her it's nice to have Asian representation and she agreed. So I don't know, I think she is trying and I will have to keep talking to her if I see something super obviously racist",1651873211.0

As the title says, it's been a little frustrating trying to get my family (who are all white) and friends to understand why I've been so anxious going out in public. I've always been a pretty anxious person, but ever since the pandemic happened, I've gotten worse. I'm always afraid that some stranger is going to approach me and verbally or physically attack me. At the very start of the pandemic, my dad told me nonchalantly, ""Oh - looks like there's been an increase in hate crimes against Asian people."" In the same breath, he asked if I wanted to come with him to go shopping. Like, NO, I DON'T, DAD. You just told me that hate crimes are being committed against Asians. Why would I want to go out right after you said that?

One of my friends noticed how nervous I've become, and when I told her why, she told me that I didn't have to worry about hate crimes being committed against me because I'm Korean, not Chinese. First of all, being Chinese doesn't justify any hate crime, and second of all, I think we all know that it literally doesn't matter what ""type"" of Asian you are. We all get generalized into the same group.

This morning, my mother asked me if I wanted to go with her to NYC this weekend to just ""walk around."" I told her no, because there's been a lot of hate crimes against Asians there. She seemed baffled by what I said, because it's never occurred to her to think about this.

Look, I know that I'm being overly paranoid, and I am in the process of seeking out a therapist. At the same time, I just wish that my friends/family would at least be aware of WHY I'm feeling this way.

EDIT: Thank you for the awards! Also, thank you to everyone who commented, and to those who reached out to my privately. It's a weird (but good) feeling to be validated like this. I expected people to say that I was overreacting, or that I was being too sensitive, since those are the typical responses I would get from people irl. ",1652877780.0

Another one I hear frequently is ""anti-Asian Xenophobia"". Calling it xenophobia is problematic because:
1) it's inaccurate because Asian people are being targeted by race, not by country of birth, so it downplays the number of people affected;
2) it reinforces the ""perpetual foreigner"" trope by assuming all racially Asian people must be foreigners in their own country. (Xenophobia is prejudice against people from other countries, but people born in the US aren't ""from Asia"").",1588151334.0

The museum downplays german atrocities (holocaust barely mentioned, human experimentation not mentioned, and nazis on meth was skipped) while accurately depicting Japanese war crimes doing explicitly similar things (unit 731 for example).

My concern is that the museum is potentially adding to the current yellow scare. One woman I overheard calling the Japanese ""savages"" after watching a vid on the kamikaze pilots, not understanding what it meant to be one. ""All gave some/ some gave all'' is embedded in the US military doctrine and has a similar meaning of ultimate sacrifice.¬†

Meanwhile, what isn't mentioned is that the US committed heinous war crimes against POW the same as the Japanese and German. Collecting teeth/body parts, using flamethrowers against unarmed POW, and worse. War in general makes savages of all involved.

As a 4th gen Japanese American I was offended by the depiction of the internment camps and the portrayal of what had happened to my grandparents. The Jap slur was thrown around a lot, but at least they didn't say Nip. At one point at the beginning of a vid it popped up in massive letters and the asian couple I was next to just straight up left the room giving me a look that said ""was that f-ed up or was that just me?"" It would have been better to preface the ethnic slurs with something like, ""this language is used for historical accuracy and should not be repeated."" I overheard a few people using the slur after walking out since they thought it was ok to do so since it was on the screen in big bold letters multiple times and in other exhibits.

Along with that the mention of the Japanese internment were minimal, but at least there was an exhibit and recognized as a shameful part of US history. They up-played the 442nd nisei regiment and mentioned they were the most decorated, but there wasn't an extensive exhibit for them or most of the medal of honor recipients. To be fair I did not see anything about the Tuskegee airmen, unless I just missed that.

The museum painted life in internment camps as being peaceful, but failed to mention what they lost. Also, failed to mention the Manzanar riot. Basically the excuse for Order 9066 was that Americans were scared and it was justified.

Imagine being turned into the enemy overnight, told to pack a few suitcases, forced away from your livelihood, assets frozen, never truly allowed to return to that home (since they were repossessed and sold), put on buses, and sent to basically the middle of nowhere. Camps were very hit or miss, always surrounded by barbed wire with decent to shit living quarters. After getting out you were faced with rampant racism, even in the bay area. My dad experienced this well into the 70's and often avoids discussing that part of our history.¬†

My grandparents worked hard to regain a foothold in Oakland and were often spat on just for existing. They also experienced far worse, but I don't want to go into explicit details. My grandma was trained to be a nurse, but couldn't become an RN, because she was Japanese. She had to work as a cleaning lady and my grandpa was a gardener. They became part of a community of nisei in Oakland that tried to become as American as possible and blend in with the US culture.¬†

¬†After watching a short vid where they talked about how the Japanese made do with the conditions, gardening and playing baseball, I was heartbroken having heard a first hand account from my grandma. Fun fact my grandpa was sent to one of the worst camps and, supposedly, helped to burn it down right before getting released.¬†

¬†Lots of this history is whitewashed, ignored, and forgotten. The impact of WWII has impacted me to this day as I know very little of my heritage past WWI where my great grandpa had enlisted to gain citizenship. I have never heard any stories about him besides he was somehow a sergeant in the army that didn't speak english.

¬†I don't speak Japanese or Cantonese and I can't connect with most ABC or recent Japanese immigrants. My ex gf is white and couldn't grasp what it's like to be split between multiple cultures. Ultimately, I'm not able to relate to most Asians around the bay in general.¬†

What she saw was an Asian family that was doing well in the Bay Area. My dad was a Mech. Eng. NASA civil servant that contributed to the space exploration program. I had tried to explain the impact of WWII and how hard my family had to work to be seen as American.¬†

All she could say was her family struggled too and I shouldn't be complaining. Her grandpa was mayor of a small town in Illinois and her parents both got to go to college without debt. Their struggle as white Americans was completely different given that they had significantly more opportunities. From a superficial perspective they seem to be doing well in a massive gated community that only had to struggle for 5-10 years not 4 generations.

My point in writing all of this is that I've identified as an American and yet I will always be a foreigner, despite my family being here for several generations. It seems like for white European immigrants, after 2 generations they get to be regarded as an American without much trouble.

¬†I decided to write all of this, because the WWII museum left a massive impact on me. It ripped open so many wounds from the past and present. The shame of imperialism, honor for those imprisoned in the US, and hope for all the Japanese Americans that can relate. I hope to one day move past this and find a community that has gone through the same experience. I've found a small group of 2nd and 3rd gen Americans (white, latin, and asian), but their stories are unique and we only can draw parallels to our families histories.¬†

Sorry for the lengthy post. I hope this gets read and understood by someone experiencing the same struggle.¬†

BTW this isn't a call to boycott the WWII museum, but rather to share my experience. The museum is amazing, clearly impactful, and worth a visit, just go in understanding it's an American perspective being told with some major oversights.",1658369435.0

790,Disgusting racism towards asian americans,286,ba1puy,asianamerican,https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/ba1puy/disgusting_racism_towards_asian_americans/,157,"I‚Äôve been thinking about writing this a long time. There are moments in my daily life where the negative racial experiences during my childhood incessantly hound my mind and I cannot stop thinking about them. They create a depressive, deep, dark void of self loathing that makes me feel so small yet furious. Why were people to volatile towards me? Why are they still so volatile? Why has society almost come to accept even overt racism towards asian americans/asians in general?

I‚Äôll give you a bit of background information before I share my personal experiences. I am an asian american female, but was adopted when I was a baby. I have white parents. I grew up in the suburbs and attended an upper middle class-upper class elementary school and middle school. I was pretty much the only asian in all my classes, through Kindergarten to 8th grade. In elementary school, I was like one of three asians total‚Äîin the whole school. So, naturally, I was seen as different. But different in a bad way. In elementary school, most of the kids weren‚Äôt directly racist towards me. They just asked me about my real parents, and some asked me why my eyes looked different (this was probably the most offensive at the time). It was the parents that were incredibly racist towards me. I remember a girl, who seemed to like me and take interest in my asian heritage, came up to me one day and said her mom told her I was an alien. I told my Mom this, and she did not seem surprised‚Äîapparently she was used to the parents (usually the moms) making racist remarks like that. Remembering this infuriates me to this day; preying upon an 8 year old girl, calling her an alien just because of her race should NOT be tolerated, yet people seemed to think it was fine. It disgusts me and baffles me, thinking that even socially conscious adults had the capacity to be so shamelessly racist towards asians. 

Middle school, however, was where I experienced the most of my racism torment. One kid constantly harassed me on the bus, making fun of how I looked, making fun of everything I did (I started texting my mom, he makes fun of me texting my mom. I get off on my street, he makes fun of where I live. I was a very quiet girl, so it was easy for them to torment me and get away with it). I remember one particularly terrible day with almost pristine clarity. It got so bad that I immediately went to my room when I got home and cried for hours. The same kid was talking about me behind my back to a group of friends. They spoke loudly on purpose so I could hear their conversation. ‚ÄúLook at her eyes. It‚Äôs so obvious she‚Äôs asian.‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, its so obvious when she looks down.‚Äù Then a girl chimed in. ‚ÄúHa ha. Asian.‚Äù As if being asian was inherently funny. As if it was something to be laughed at. I felt so ugly and disgusting. This was perhaps one of the more offensive moments during my childhood. It was not uncommon, however, that someone made fun of my appearance in midde school. When I was in a church group comprising of other kids my age, one girl randomly pointed at me and pulled back her eyes to immitate the classic, caricatured imitation of oriental eyes. She told another girl in my group to do the same with her eyes. They all proceeded to stare at me in disgust, while I just sat there quietly, shocked at what I did to make them judge me or hate me that much. Later, I went outside to sit on a bench and cry for the rest of the night, until my mom picked me up. 

These are just a few instances that made up my miserable childhood of being ostracized and hating myself. Middle school was especially a dark time for me. And they didn‚Äôt just make fun of my appearance. Many asked if I ate dogs (this year my 5 year old cousin asked me if I ate dogs, because her mom told her asians did) and many made fun of the asian languages by saying ‚Äúchingchong,‚Äù etc whenever I was near them. And I took it all. I held my tongue. I felt like their torment was somehow warrented, like I was some sort of abominable creature different from the rest. I still carry the same self-loathing even today. And that is what bothers me the most. The scars are irreversible. Why does American society think it‚Äôs okay to overtly tear down a whole race? Why is it okay to have so many prejudices and hatred towards them? I am aware that asians don‚Äôt want to fight back and hold their tongue like I did. But it doesn‚Äôt make it okay. 

I think this post has gotten long enough, however. I want to hear some of your stories about experiencing racism as an asian. I want to hear your thoughts about why they are so prevalent, and why some people think it‚Äôs okay. I think society should bring to light the struggles of the asian american, because experiencing what I have experienced has torn me down to irreversible, deprecating self hatred.  ",1554533510.0

So I wanted to make a list and outline why each one is problematic imo

* Chinese
   * **""+10000 social credits""** If this is a jab at the Chinese government, why are you commenting it on random posts of Chinese people? 
   * **""Why are all the animal abuse videos from China??""** Confirmation bias. I've seen countless animal abuse videos from all over the world. It's not unique, prolific, or condoned in China as you think.
   * **""Chinese people eat anything <insert holier-than-thou attitude on meat consumption>""** Nothing is wrong with eating different animals. Different animals are eaten across the world, it's not just a Chinese thing.
   * **""Their parent must be so disappointed. B+? Why no A+??""** Not your joke to make. Plus it paints a demonizing (with little nuance) picture of Chinese parenthood
   * **""SumTing Wong""** Mocking Chinese names is terribly unfunny. Why is your first thought when you see a Chinese person is to mock their language and name?
* Indian
   * **""All these creepy Indian men keep sliding into my DMs""** Why are we signalling out just Indian men? There are creepy men EVERYWHERE.
* Japanese
   * **""WAIFUUU""** r-neckbeard is pretty self-explanatory
   * **""Did you know?? In Japan, they do <insert mundane thing> omggg why is Japan so advance""** Seemingly harmless, right? But a lot of things that get praised for being ""only in Japan"" is not limited to Japan at all. This kind of thinking plays into the fetishization of Japan and its people as well as leads to the demonization of other Asian countries for not being as ""advance."" Also the condescending ""Asia expert"" tone
* South Korean
   * **""They get plastic surgery because they want to look white""** First of all, double eyelids are not unique to white people. Many East Asian people have double eyelids naturally. Secondly, if they were trying to look white, why wouldn't the surgery be about the epicanthic fold which is arguably the defining trait of ""Asian eyes""? East Asian beauty standards are their own thing and not about white people. Not to say colorism and white-worshipping doesn't exist however, but that's a separate issue.
   * **""All Kpop singers are enslaved/manufactured""** The pop music industry in South Korea does have its problems, but it's weird to paint it out as unique to South Korea. Then to go and demonize everyone in the industry because of the extremists? Also plays into the stereotype that East Asians are not creative and are just mindless drones

I'm not saying that America is worse (I find it difficult to rate oppression anyway), but I wish that some of my white peers would care as much about American dystopia (which they can more easily address, as voters) as they did Eastern dystopia.

821,Wtf is happening in San Fran-Oaklamd Chinatown?!,276,lden52,asianamerican,https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/lden52/wtf_is_happening_in_san_franoaklamd_chinatown/,54,"As our community probably knows there have been a recent uptick in robberies and assaults on Asian elderly and women. Let me point out the elephant in the room: Race of the suspects are overwhelmingly African American. We tend to fear those old white Trump supporter types who say things like Kung Flu and China virus and other racially insensitive things. However, the real hate crimes against Asians seem to be from the black community. Now I understand this is a controversial thing to say but its just the data. I am in no way blaming black people, but I am curious as to why this is happening. I've heard about this kind of black and Asian anamosity before the pandemic. But the uptick has gotten my attention these past few months. Also when the pandemic started, hate crimes against Asians in NYC were on the rise. Most perpetrators were also black. 

What do you guys think can be done to help resolve the tensions between black and Asian communities? Would better relations and communication between the groups make things better? I'm so naive because I don't live in California or ny. I live in WA and this kind of shit doesn't happen much here where I live. It seems like CA and NY have these problems much more so than in WA. I don't want to blame or point fingers. I just want to state the obvious and discuss some ideas on how to stop this from happening. I have friends and family in CA and NY who express their concerns to me. Thoughts...",1612552163.0

2nd disclaimer: asian american communities have their own hateful sentiments that should be worked on too. but that's for ourselves only. not for overseas people we have no control over. 

you guys know how i found out about the uyghur concentration camp situation? some asshole in class asked a chinese AMERICAN kid ""why are your people doing this? tell them to stop"". you know when china started blaming black people for covid? black people were calling for a boycott of chinese AMERICAN businesses (disclaimer: i understand that anti-black racism is a problem in aa communities, but ""punishing"" them based off of what mainland chinese govt does still does not make sense). if you want examples, look at iameloho on yt (whose channel is lowkey vv anti-asian in many ways including refusing to ""take the cape"" for us during covid bc apparently asians are all complacent racists to blacks, which isn't even 100% true. in fact, many of our ppl \*cough cough, bootlicking high profile ppl like andrew yang\* care more about anti-black racism than racism against asian americans). AND EVERYWHERE on social media and comment sections you always see folks asking us ""well what about talking about china/korea/phillipines/vietnam/etc...? they're doing \[insert bad thing\]"" 

this is all just masked xenophobia. to them, we are perpetual foreigners just taking a visit here from our homelands (which many of us have not been in for GENERATIONS). i'm done shrinking in my seat whenever anyone mentions anything china does. i'm done feeling shameful and guilty whenever an asian person slips up because i know i will have to take the blame. 

we have to stick up for ourselves and most importantly learn to love our heritage despite what western media and all the other races try to convince us about our own people. we're everyone's punching bag as of now, but we don't have to take it.",1592625644.0

848,I Hate Being Asian,274,ttrqm2,asianamerican,https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/ttrqm2/i_hate_being_asian/,49," I hate being Asian.

It was 3rd grade. I had just moved from a private catholic school to a public elementary school. At the time, I was an only child of parents that barely spoke an ounce of English. It was difficult to communicate and get my point across to them. I didn‚Äôt have anyone to rely on for advice when encountering any type of issue, especially racism.

The first day I walked into that classroom is when I got a firsthand experience of racism. They mocked me with the slanty eyes as all kids do. The next progression was the language. It was always ching chong. Aren‚Äôt people the most unoriginal? Then eventually, it went one further they had this new saying, ‚ÄúChinese, Japanese I‚Äôm going to kick your knees.‚Äù Like dude I‚Äôm not even Chinese or Japanese. I‚Äôm Vietnamese. Grade 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12

10 years that‚Äôs how long I‚Äôve experienced, and took to grow numb to the verbal abuse of racism. Now I shrug off racism with ease. But this definitely wasn‚Äôt always the case. Today I am proud to call myself a Vietnamese American. I express my ethnicity with pride regardless of what others may think.

My goal in telling my story is that so others who are currently going through the same thing I did have a group of people they can turn to and share their current predicament. Please share your story and share it with others so that they can also find a place where we can all belong. 

I'll be posting a new story every day for the full month of April.

That's why I am always anxious whenever an Asian American person speaks out because I don't know if they are doing it for Asian street cred or if they genuinely feel this way and are willing to risk everything to make the world a better place.

It doesn't help the Asian American community is so fractured that we really can't get anything done.

Maybe it is because I am Asian and am more obvious when it comes to Asian American issues but it feels like the internal fracture is less so in the African or Latin American communities. ",1552312755.0
913,Crazy Experience with Dude at the Courts,262,v3c7ov,asianamerican,https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/v3c7ov/crazy_experience_with_dude_at_the_courts/,62,"This jawns so crazy, I have to post it. I've never seen anything like it.

tldr; white dude with Chinese wife gets pissed at ABC for not speaking Chinese to him

I'm an ABC and I love playing outdoor basketball. I'm in a wechat group with some local grad fobs and we been balling for a few months tgt now, real easy. Courts real diverse, everyone's having a good time, good competition and sportsmanship. I appreciate this gc bc I can practice my poor Chinese.

There's this one white dude in the wechat group, has himself a Chinese wife and kid, 33 years old. Lived in the mainland for some years. Everybody else in the group sends emojis of balls and bugs to set a time to play. He's the only dude sending giant paragraphs and voice recordings of himself speaking in Chinese. Prolly loves the ""woah this white dude can speak Chinese"" comments he gets from staying in China. He looks like a crustier Ben Kingsley in ShangChi.

I meet him for the first time in real life at the courts. Woah nice to meet you dude. I say hi to my fob friends. White dude talks back to me in Chinese. First thing he asks me asks me, where  are your parents? . I say Wuhan and he starts explaining to me what people eat there (re gan mian) and translating dishes. I'm in English like ay that's cool I knew that already, I eat those frequently  but lemme warm up real quick.  English ofc is my primary language, I ... talk to most people in America in English unless you're a fob and Mandarin is more comfortable and you can express your true self better that way.

My game starts and I'm running with 2 of my fob friends. We're communicating, yelling in English, calling out screens. We win the game thanks to a 6'6 black dude, I go to get some water. White dude is standing in front of my bag. I say, ""oop excuse me"". He says no problem buddy. I see my fob friend leaving, I try to catch him, say ""see you later"" in Chinese.

I come back, the white dude is pissed. He's seething. I sit down to swap out my shoes and drink some water. He leans over me and says, ""why aren't you speaking to me in Chinese"" in Chinese. I drink my water and go, oh uh I don't know uh guess I prefer English. He keeps speaking in Chinese, ""I see you talking to him in Chinese but not me, what's your problem?"" I'm tryna explain myself. He gets angrier and angrier and crosses a line.

This goes on for like 2 minutes. 2 minutes! Gaslighting me saying I'm racist. I get up. Dude's like 5'8, I'm about 6'2. I get up and start going ""Are you fucking kidding me? Are you serious?"" He starts walking away, calling me ""shen jing bing"" which means like mentally ill. I follow him. My blood's boiling, but I'm not tryna fight, I just got a new FAANG job. I throw everything in the book at him. Crusty ass little dude, wife and a kid acting like a little child, you're gonna raise your daughter like this? bitch ass little boy, musty ass hair, embarrassing. He goes to sit down on the farthest bench possible. Everybody's laughing and some dudes tell me to chill, I'm explaining what just happened. The clownery that just unfolded. The fobs at the court don't say anything and quietly ignore the situation.

API Month just ended and we got clowns acting like this the next day.  I stg white dudes who live in Asia for a bit come back to the states thinking they can talk to minorities however they like. They're used to Asians just being pushover, some crazy superiority complex. Under no circumstances is that the right choice to get in anyone's face and force them to speak a language to you. It's ridiculous. I've never seen anything like it lmao. White guys tell me to speak Engrish in America and now a new one, white guy tells me to speak Chinese to him or I'm racist. I'm not your little concubine clown, you don't tell me how I treat you. He thought he could get in my Chinaman face like that and I'd be like ""oh yes sir sorry your highness"" and he'd feel like he was hot shit. Jawns crazy. It feels like nobody ever told him that's not how you talk to people? I said ""Excuse me"" to the guy to get my water and he got upset.

He left the wechat group rambling some nonsense.

Why share this? Lot of people on here talk about defending yourself. Lot of posts like, ""Someone bumped into me on the subway and called me wuhan virus"". Situationally I had mad shooters at the courts so I knew I could talk shit, so don't get hurt if you dont' have backup, but if you're safe and have size, talk your shit, don't let these clowns push you around. Do what you need to do, say what you need to say so you don't ruminate about it when you go home later, (but absolutely be smart and be safe about it)

And they were funny (at least I thought they were back then).  Also, for a Asian American midwest kid who was the only Asian kid in his class, they created a sense of community, that I wasn't alone out there. 

So I started mimicking them, making similar jokes in school. And life was good. I grew up in a rough middle school, and the kids stopped beating me up because I was funny. I got a lot of good laughs, I had friends. But then I realized, some of the kids weren't laughing at my jokes, they were laughing at the accent. They were laughing at my parents, my uncles, my aunts, and in general my culture. 

In their heads, I gave them a golden ticket to shit on Asians. ""This kid's doing is so I can probably do it as well"". I stopped doing the accent, and thankfully I realized though this I could get laughs without the accent. 

But recently I've seen a resurgence of Asian Accent comedy on youtube. Especially with the rise of Uncle Roger. I'm sure Nigel is a nice guy and he's a funny guy. But we gotta stop giving other people an excuse to mock us and look down on us. Because they're not laughing at the jokes, they're laughing at us.",1651686642.0

Everyone in the club is either ABC or adopted. So their Chinese is limited. They also don't know much about Chinese culture. Everyone relates because they talk about their struggles being Asian in America. 

I grew up speaking Chinese. I speak Mandarin at home, and it's my first language. It's not perfect but decent. I also grew up watching Chinese dramas. As a kid I was fascinated by Chinese culture. I like learning about Chinese holidays, history, fashion and food. I'm super Chinese compared to all the club members. 

In the club we were talking about food and holidays. A student said she eats those sticky rice covered with leaves and wondered if it's associated with a holiday. I told her it's the dragon boat festival. She told me she's super ABC so she doesn't know what that is.

I don't really know how to connect with everyone. Because I grew up in an Asian bubble. I never had any troubles growing up Asian. I did bring Asian snacks to school, some students made comments on it but it didn't bother me at all. Or when kids made ching chong jokes at me, it didn't hurt my feelings because I didn't know what they were talking about. My dumbass thought that was a different dialect.

It's the worst it's ever been. 

My worry is that this increasing paranoia and tension will manifest into violent attacks on any Asian who is Chinese or ""looks chinese."" Considering how the entire media- from liberals to conservatives- encourage racism against Asians, I fear that the west will be a dangerous place for Asians. 
Not just the west, this sinophobic phenomena will spread globally even in Asia. Chinese people who have never associated with the government at all will be blamed and persecuted. Incidents like the Indonesian riots will occur. This is the new yellow peril. 

I agree the Chinese government is oppressive, but when reddit blames the entire culture and regular Chinese people who are INNOCENT, that is pure hatred and racism. 

Asians have got to stick together now more than ever. We can't afford to be quiet and passive any longer. We need to be vocal and stand up for our people and culture. 

What can we do about this? One way to dispel this propaganda is positive Asian representation in the west and not just mere caricatures. Another way is protests. Remember after the ISIS attacks Muslims were holding up ""Hug a Muslim"" signs, to show that Muslims are peaceful and not dangerous like the media depicts? I believe Asians need to do the same thing in the near future.

I'm an Asian man married to a white woman. We have a baby.

Today we were hanging out outside with her sister's family. I had Baby in my lap. Niece came along and started making faces to amuse Baby. 

I realized Niece was pulling at her eyes. I asked, ""What are you doing?"" Niece wandered off without answering. Probably didn't hear me because we were outside with a bunch of kids running around.

Niece came back and started making faces again. Definitely pulling at her eyes with her fingers. It took me a few tries but eventually I called her name loudly enough that she looked at me, and then I told her, ""Stop doing that. Don't ever do that again.""

At which point the mom (my sister in law) turned around and asked what Niece was doing. I told her, thinking she'd handle it. Incredibly, Mom turned back away without a word. Niece wandered off again.

After a couple of minutes, Mom turned to me and asked that ""if I thought something was race related"" I please explain to her kids why I wanted them to stop instead of just yelling at them.

I was pretty pissed off at this point so I told her I thought that was more the parents' job. 

I've since heard through my wife that Mom doesn't want me around Niece any more. Also that Mom has been crying all afternoon. Yes, Mom has all the right yard signs. 

The bright spot in all this is that my wife agrees that her sister is in the wrong. That makes me a bit more hopeful that she'll stand up for our kid when they visit without me.",1634538722.0

Our community has undergone some changes and we‚Äôve opened up a lot more to discussions, but we wanted to remind everyone of a couple of things:

This community‚Äôs [first principals](https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/wiki/rules#wiki_principles) are about being a supportive, positive atmosphere. This is in an effort to be a different type of Reddit community than your usual online spaces. We‚Äôve seen an uptick in content that is overtly negative or cynical. Some of this is an understandable reaction to current news but a lot of it is not in the spirit of the kind community we are cultivating. We ask you to report this content if you see anything of this sort and do not engage. This goes double for any comment that is derisive of queer, mixed, or any intersection of identity-Asians. We are an explicitly inclusive space. 

Secondly, we‚Äôre bringing back a rule that we used to have in the sub that served us well in the past: speak for yourself, not others. We thought this would be implicit in the kindness and no generalizations, but we‚Äôre choosing to bring it back explicitly. It‚Äôs one thing to share your frustrations or feelings, but it‚Äôs another to generalize and deride others who don‚Äôt share those viewpoints. That‚Äôs where dialogue no longer happens. Anything that generalizes whole groups of Asians and any other group of people derisively has no space here. 

Thanks for sticking with us and supporting our community through your continued engagement. We hope to be a space where anyone who identifies as Asian American feels seen, supported, and loved.",1657655232.0
