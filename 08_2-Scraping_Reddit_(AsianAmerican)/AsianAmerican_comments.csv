22,me5ef9,"This shirt is made by [Flavours](https://flavoursmerch.com). Their ethos is about unifying the world and all the flavours of people through intent, awareness and love. They're also donating some of the proceeds to AAPI organizations to provide real support for the cause.

Its really wild to see all these print on demand/dropshipping bots pop up and (poorly) copy a design from a small business though. Everybody's after the bag by any means. I hope they can come up with some more honorable ways to get paid, but everybody has to eat. 

I had to get the authentic one that Dame has on from Flavours though."

I’d also like to point out that James’ mom, sweet, innocent, and well-meaning as she is, demonstrates the attitude fatal to Asian and Asian American rights: a lack of unity. Once you get to the United States, divisions on national origin don’t matter anymore in the eyes of a racist populace and power structure: only the color of your skin. Asians need to understand that before we can make any real traction."
1,gkut94,[deleted]
2,gkut94,IME a lot of (not all) racists do differentiate Asians.  I've seen a lot of people fetishizing certain ethnic groups while calling for genocide against others.  All you need to do is look into a lot of these alt-right weeaboo communities.

1,mf1q4w,The amount of people trying to invalidate this person’s tweet is repulsive.  I agree that it’s best to avoid the comments on this one.
2,mf1q4w,"Tell this to r/asianbeauty. In a post about anti-asian hate, the mods claimed they are ""not a political sub"" as a rationale for why anti-asian hate wasn't gaining traction there. Um, these are huge fans of asian products but when it comes to asian hate, they're not political 🙄

EDIT: [screenshot from last week](https://i.imgur.com/ELFT552.png)"
3,mf1q4w,[Always at least one variant of this on twitter whenever someone famous talks about stopping Asian hate.](https://twitter.com/DWillF1/status/1375894039631912960) Did he miss the part where Naomi Osaka is half black?
4,mf1q4w,"Sadly, racist weebs have no problem attacking China / Chinese people, specially European ones. I hang out with a lot of weebs."
5,mf1q4w,"Anyone who enjoys Asian culture needs to speak up.

Anyone who profits off Asian culture needs to put in actual time or money to fight anti-Asian racism."
6,mf1q4w,"if you want to maintain faith in humanity, skip the comments on this one. I'm starting to think there are actually more people who care about us, just not enough to face backlash for calling out anti-Asian racism. This is at least the second time Naomi's been shit on in the comments for calling this stuff out."
7,mf1q4w,"What I've come to realize is that many (if not most) Western ""fans of Asian culture"" (really East Asian culture, but everything west of the 110° longitude line might as well not exist to them) do not consider Asians as individual people, but as some sort of culture-creating hivemind singularity. 

They don't care or even want to be made aware of the life or plights of Asians or Asian Americans - They only care about getting their fill of anime, k-pop, or whatever thin slice of East Asian culture they enjoy without ""baggage"", and anything that interrupts that hedonistic stream (such as being reminded that Asians are actual human beings or East Asian geopolitics is complicated) is a mere annoyance.

In their view, the only worth of Asian people is the music, drama, or whatever else they create – Why is my stan posting about #StopAsianHate? They should be busy creating music I enjoy, not posting about politics I don’t care about. Why is my favorite drama being canceled over some minor geopolitical squabble? They all look the same anyway, they should just make up and shut up. Why are the Asians fighting over some historical bullshit? Can’t we just enjoy our anime in peace?

To them, Asians should be thankful of the largesse of the gracious West in patronizing Asian culture – After all, the international market is the only reason k-pop (which apparently did not exist before the Hallyu boom) is sustainable, manga artists should be happy that people are reading their painstaking creations on Mangadex and are proud of it, and it is up to the discerning White palate to “clean up” Asian food.

In their opinion, Asians are desperate to become White anyways – after all, anime characters are white, idols have plastic surgery to look more “Western”, and Asians bleach their skin because they want to look more Caucasian, don't they? They should be thankful for the Western appropriation. In addition, whenever some Asian issue comes into the limelight, they are busy denigrating Asian countries as morally inferior to the enlightened West. They will bring up Uyghurs on a post about hate crimes against Asian Americans, will dismiss the COVID response in East Asia as obedient collectivism in mindless deference to authority (in contrast to the self-respecting individualism of the West), and edit pictures and drawings of Asians with white skin to look more “real” i.e. yellow. (typically with the comment “Accept yourself :3”)

I think to many Western (read – white) people, protests about the hate crimes against Asian Americans (and Asians in the west in general) is both a trifle and an Achilles’ heel. On one hand, it is just another case of ungrateful people of color whining despite the fact the West is generously tolerating their existence, as well as benevolently engaging in their quirky little customs. On the other hand, it is rather embarrassing, and makes their moral snobbery awkward – To them, it is like a small pimple on the clean face of Western morality that should go away as soon as they can shut the ungrateful Asians up."
8,mf1q4w,"I understand the sentiment but don't necessarily agree with it. We shouldn't be valued because of what we can produce including cultural products. A racist could easily say they don't like those things or justify harming people from a culture whose products they dont consume. Also, those are all East Asian products and there's much more diversity within the Asian community than just East Asians.

I feel like telling others they should value Asian people because of what they have given and produced for the world can lead to valuing them as products more than as people. All people are inherently valuable regardless of what they produce."

15,mf1q4w,"Asian news reveals numerous cases of rape, violence, crime, hate and disrespect asians have for other asians. There are a number of asians that think they are better than other people around the world.

Get ready for more Anti-Asian crimes, which your propagandists will try to spin it as caused by white supremacy.  So sad our leaders are working for the other side.  You guys for kicking Asian kids out of the specialized H.S. too so the poor Asians don't have a way out?"

0,m6naqx,"So all these hate crimes have come down to this... A fucking murder spree. Happened in the city I live in too. 

This hits very heavy for me. Please take care of yourselves."
1,m6naqx,Any bets on how long until someone tries to blame mental illness or talks about how this piece of shit has a promising future ahead of him once he's rehabilitated?
2,m6naqx,Americans (of all races) seem only to care about us when they’re appropriating our culture or fetishizing us. Sigh. I feel reluctant to even post about this mass shooting (or AAPI hate crimes in general) on my social media because it feels like shouting into a void. We have the “privilege” of being the model minority so it feels like I have no right to vent and would look foolish doing so. Idk.
3,m6naqx,"As awful as it is to say, this was coming wasn’t it? It’s been building towards this and now it’s happened. 

I’m tired. I feel like even with the staggering amount of crimes committed against Asian people this year even this won’t grab the attention it deserves from the “mainstream” or “woke sjw” social media folks. 

Feels like I’m yelling into the void."
4,m6naqx,"This makes me so sad.

I was just talking to my therapist this morning about my anxiety with an Asian school or business getting shot up by a gunman."
5,m6naqx,"Seeing this breaks my heart. I’m so angry about all of the Asian hate crimes, especially within the last year."
6,m6naqx,They caught the shooter. Looks like a loser incel whiteboy. https://www.ajc.com/news/breaking-multiple-shootings-shut-down-busy-woodstock-highway/OLE23RVIO5BE3ELWBZAA6GVSSA/
7,m6naqx,"Unfortunately, inevitable. America is fucked! 

Canada seems next as hate crimes against Asians is rising there too. 

Australia is racist. 

NZ not so bad, less violent, still noticeable, albeit safer than the countries listed above. 

UK is a shitehole for Asians. 

Where the fuck can we all go and live to be safe?!?"
8,m6naqx,"RIP :(

When we're done mourning and processing, what can we do? I see a lot of talk about standing up, uniting, and speaking up, but I can't help but feel like it's falling on deaf ears. I'm fortunate enough to be a situation where I can donate, but I struggle to see what that'll accomplish. Politicians don't care or can't do anything. The mainstream white community doesn't care (if they're not busy supporting the racists or wedging us against other minorities). I know we can start on the individual level, but I honestly don't think there's anyone itching to commit an anti-Asian hate crime in my network. How do we stop this from happening again or getting worse?

I'm tired, but legit question btw. I think there are many of us eager to do something to fight this but just don't know how."
9,m6naqx,"I'm honestly broken by this. I thought I was desensitized to mass violence (for better or worse) after Sandy Hook, Pulse, Vegas, Christchurch, Parkland FL... but this one is the final straw on the camel's back for me. Maybe it's the fact that I used to work with Asian immigrant women trafficked into massage parlors, maybe it's the fact this piece of shit was taken in alive, maybe it's the fact that I'm an Asian American woman from the south, who knows.

All I know is I'm sick to my stomach thinking about how exactly **nothing** is going to change as a result of this. We will focus too much on the murderer and not enough on the circumstances that cultivate ideologies like his. Celebrities and public figures will post in solidarity with the victims and their families. #StopAsianHate will trend for a while. Then another racist/xenophobic/misogynist motivated mass shooting will happen and we'll be back at square one."
10,m6naqx,Dumbass drives a Hyundai car too. Let’s hope this terrorist actually get penalized and not “1300 hours in anti-racist education” or probation
11,m6naqx,My girlfriend is a journalist and gets push alerts from every major news outlet ranging from NYT to AP to CNN.  She got 8 different alerts and all of them just said 8 dead; not even mentioning that it could be racially motivated.

13,m6naqx,This is devastating. Targeting some of the most marginalized members of our community. I know someone who used to work as a masseuse. It is tiring work for pretty shitty pay.

16,m6naqx,Horrific
17,m6naqx,"A [Korean source](https://www.nocutnews.co.kr/news/5517523) says that all four women were of Korean descent, if you were wondering. My heart goes out to all the victims and their families."

22,m6naqx,"This is tragic and just makes me so angry. I'm so over this country and this society that doesn't see us as important enough to care about. 

On a side note, I have a feeling we'll see those right wingers who for some reason (that we all know about why) suddenly turned into ""advocates"" for anti-Asian crime be silent about this."
23,m6naqx,This is fucking infuriating.  We must stand up

30,m6naqx,This is so fucked up.
31,m6naqx,"Well, I guess I’m not surprised that the authorities and MSM (I’m watching CNN) are trying to pivot to the shooter having a “sex addiction” and subtly implying these women were just sex workers. Will be interested to see if they continue to pursue this narrative and away from the hate crime nature of these murders."
32,m6naqx,Of course he looks like your stereotypical inbred chinless incel fucktard. This is why I'm a firm believer of taking advantage of the second amendment to defend yourselves not from the government but from incel fucks like this guy.

Meanwhile, we get to worry about ourselves and family members being literally murdered because these same assholes group all Asian people together.

But enough about Americans being afraid of being murdered for the sin of looking like another race of people. Let's keep talking about how Dr. Seuss is cancelled."

Does he hate Sex Workers?

Is it all three?

And fuck this year, and the fucking media.  Isn't it strange that:

1. Most of the Anti-Asian violence has been against Elders and Women
2. How little reporting this has been getting in the news compared to how much they talk about ""China""
3. How little folks care about  violence against sex workers in general"

>""It was felt that there was no hate involved instead \[the rapist\] was very infatuated with the Japanese race.""  

 I read this goddamn article like twelve years ago and still remember it because of how angry I felt. And it's still relevant.  The system has been using fetishization and objectification of Asian women as proof that crimes against us cannot possibly be ""hate crimes.""

The victims of these murders and sexual assaults would not have been in the position they were in, would not have been victimized, if they were not first identified as Asian women.

Dehumanization is a form of hate.

Seeing news outlets and leaders speak of the Atlanta mass shooting like this wasn't a hate crime (bias crime) is infuriating.  He saw them as objects, used them as objects, and disposed of them like objects.  Maybe you can't hate something you view as an object.  Maybe you can't commit a crime against an object. But they weren't objects.

They were women, immigrants, working class, Asian, and engaged in sex work.  These loci they occupied in society systemically stripped them of value and made them disposable.  

The cherry on top of the hate crime sundae is denying it was a hate crime at all."
44,m6naqx,God fucking damnit
45,m6naqx,"What’s so unique about the violence against Asians and Asian-Americans in America right now especially, is that it’s mostly directed at the elderly and women; the people viewed as being less able/likely to defend themselves. It’s absolutely despicable! I’m afraid that since “vulnerable” demographics are being targeted that we are going to see violence against children next. I’m terrified for my son, I’m afraid for my husband too every time he walks out the door but he thinks it’s better we go places alone because I thinks being seen with me (a white woman) with inspire more hate here in the south."

The article gives no information as to why the police think this person committed the shootings. He was 150 miles south of where the shootings took place, and it was 3.5 hours later. Sure, he might've done it, but this article doesn't give any information linking him to the shootings."

0,v8k0p1,"I’ve noticed the same on Reddit for the past few years.. that any post with anything vaguely Asian, not even specifically Chinese (they can’t tell the diff anyway) will have predictable comments. Its become like a game to me to open the thread and see how far along I have to scroll before I encounter something racist. Off the top of my head:

-Any mention of China in any context: F China! F CCP! 100 social credits. UIGHURS! My god the ughyhurs, which would be spelled 7 different ways in the same thread. Did you know the citizens don’t know anything about Tiananmen Square? So if you type it in a gaming chat they’ll automatically get banned? And followed by particularly lurid accounts of the atrocities committed. Disrespectful Chinese tourists! Stolen tech! Horrible, diseased, dirty, cruel wet markets, why can’t they buy their food fully prepped, frozen and wrapped in plastic like the rest of us. They’re all spies anyway these days 

-A picture of an Asian person doing anything: Fake and obviously staged! As if all TikToks and Instagram videos are 100% genuine and not silly sketches, these rich Chinese kids driving Lambos showing off branded clothes and buying up all the property everywhere how dare they man, did you know cheating is rampant and even encouraged? Oh and silly Asians poaching rhinos for their horns for silly TCM, as if other cultures don’t have nonsensical practices like healing crystals, also they eat all kinds of weird things (bats anyone) all cooked using gutter oil. Orange chicken, kung pao is okay, but any “real” Chinese food like dimsum is gross and slimy until it is hip, then buzzwords like “mouthfeel” and “umami” is thrown everywhere. Oh and MSG is poison and gives us headaches, even though its in Doritos, then it’s fine. If it’s a child doing something impressive, well they’re probably abused, made to practice the same thing over and over with no regard, missing childhood, no originality etc. 


-A picture of an Asian woman doing anything: did you know she probably has tons of plastic surgery and makeup? they get surgery for double eyelids at 13 and bleach their skin to look more white! And with all this surgery they all end up looking the same, it’s not us being racist at all, and it’s not like our American girls do the same thing to get that Kylie Jenner look, that’s different cos we have individuality. Maybe a mention about how the kpop idol industry is so toxic. 


-A picture of Chinese scenery: fake, or photoshopped, or it’s a tourist trap, or you can’t actually walk around without straying from the path (isn’t that the same at national parks?). God forbid if it’s a picture of somewhere in India, here comes the comments about bodies in the Ganges, or the income disparity, the social problems, people shitting everywhere. What happened to appreciating a photo of somewhere beautiful without such heavy judgement? It’s different if it’s Japanese scenery though, all that disappears, tons of comments about how it is sooo beautiful, so clean, so respectful of how the trees grow, etc etc


I’m probably missing a bunch more but it’s getting depressing!


Edit: since this post seems to be popular ima keep adding 

-Japan! Yes they’re great and all but they’re also weirdos marrying anime characters, did you know suicide rate is insanely high, they work 6am - 5:45am and they’re all secretly racist anyway oh wait till you hear about ww2 atrocities lemme link you to some particularly lurid websites…


-oh I’m totally not racist tbh but wHeRe arE yoU ReAlly FroM??? Lemme tell you all about my friend who adopted Asian kids, wait why should I teach them about their culture, cos aren’t we all AmEriCan? I’m sure they’ll grow up just fine, my white privilege will automatically rub off on them, don’t worry about it..


-god forbid anyone even breathes the word Taiwan or Hong Kong, before a tsunami of armchair experts are suddenly experts on Taiwanese and Hong Kong politics, even more so than the locals who might have diverse opinions but they don’t count anyways, don’t they have a protest to go to, make sure to bring an American flag and beg for American intervention"

like i swear everyone hates china. i'm so used to any comment section related to china being negative and stereotypical, and people say ""fuck china"" like they just want to express their anger on something totally unrelated. because i know for a FACT they do not care, they say it's ""only the government"" but they won't even take 5 seconds to find out what it's like to live in china, in the only place where it's under chinese government rules. hate against china is so so widespread that people hate us too, i know it. like it makes no sense that all of these ""activists"" act like they care, but they don't bother finding out deeper horrible things that aren't easy to find on the media. it's just called fake and first world problem

the self hate too coming from literal chinese. the media is so good at oppressing us that even chinese hate ourselves. every time i see stuff like that i'm like, don't you know you're chinese too? i saw literally people saying, ""if i dress nicer would people think i'm japanese or korean and won't hatecrime me"", ""how should i pretend to be taiwanese"", and literally chinese saying ""chinese are too obedient"". they say this because they are ashamed or because they just can't be bothered to deal with all of this sick stuff anymore."

7,v8k0p1,"Thank you for articulating this. Racism against Chinese people has always been awful on reddit, but it seems to have really intensified and spread to other parts of the internet too lately. I basically brace for bullshit every time I see anything even remotely related to China; everything always devolves into ""China bad"". It's especially disheartening when it's progressives spreading the anti-China rhetoric, oftentimes outright lies (like how Star Wars posters in China don't feature John Boyega because ""Chinese people are racist""). 

A bit of a tangent, but I've recently found a sanctuary in /r/tea, weirdly enough. It's one of the only places I've seen people talk about an aspect of Chinese culture (tea, obviously) without a side of racism. Not everything is about Chinese tea there, but people often bring up buying or drinking tea from China, and the comments are just...normal.

Mainstream media peddles these articles about China all the time, if you say something enough, the people will believe it. I'm sure if you went on the street and interviewed some people, they'd still think China is some 3rd world backwards country. Reddit is also complicit in this.

It's frustrating, but there really isn't much we can do. US is dead set on viewing China as their main adversary, so unless the US suddenly changes its tune and decides to seek cooperation, the sentiment will continue."

I am a latina woman, and I've dealt with Street harassment my whole life from men and I know what it feels like for no one to help or intervene, feeling helpless and I always look out for girls in the streets in case they are being harassed by men. I've extended it to Asian Americans, and I really hope that other people adopt my mindset and help our fellow citizens out. I know the situation is bleak, because of the institutional racism in the United States, the crazy people with long rap sheets that are allowed to roam the streets bc the justice system won't put them away for good, and the overt racists that have no fear.

That is the mentality of MOST!!!!! 😡 😢 🙄

My Mother is white and my Father is East Asian. 🌺

Growing up it was always okay to make fun of me for being Asian... But God forbid any other racism. !!! Wtf is up that?
Here's what I think... the schools and others ONLY cared if a black student was made fun of. Asian folk are more humble... They assume that racism is IGNORANCE.
People like my father would stay silent and JUST TAKE IT! 

I was approached by local news stations for this subject.
Why is it that administrations do not take harassment and racism towards people of Asian descent seriously? ONLY when BLACK students.... (Even when they're 1/1,000th ""black"") 

This is NOT okay. Asian men like my father are 😭 demasculanated and taken advantage of financially.
I always did a test when dating men. If they kicked my father with an accent ( he DOES NOT have an Asian accent)

I would be done. They would make up fake accents. My father talks just like a regular guy in Texas. No accent because he has lived here in the USA since 1967. 
He is just as much a resident as the rest of Americans and Canadians.

The CCP does NOT represent the Chinese people anymore  than ol Justin Trudeau represents Canada. I feel so sorry for the people in China. There are some very strange restrictions"

15,v8k0p1,"On Reddit, a lot of people get away with it by pulling the ""not a race"" excuse because the term ""Chinese"" can also denote nationality specifically, even though the term ""Chinese"" also has a long history of being used to refer to one's ethnic background/ancestry independent of nationality.  I've even seen some people use this excuse even after targeting Chinese Americans ffs.  That's like targeting Chicanos and then saying you're not racist because ""Mexican is a nationality, not a race""."
16,v8k0p1,"There are 1.4 billion Chinese live in China, that population is the size of American plus European plus JP/KR/NZ/AU.


And redditor think that shear size of population is a mono block of ""CCP brainwashed mindless drone dirty dog eater"". If that is true, then CCP must have some alien level brainwash technology.


The truth is a lot of western people think we are at war with China, we just can't openly declare war because of the economic ties and such. But to prepare hot war, an important step is always dehumanizing your enemy."
17,v8k0p1,"The reason for all the phenomena you've described is very simple: imperial American foreign policy is decisively marking China as a political enemy, and as such, every other category ranging from health to culture to economics, and most importantly for the United States, race, is being marshaled to strengthen the friend-enemy distinction and generate sufficient hostility to gain support for unfriendly action against China. Because race is one of those categories that is also being drawn into this sharpening distinction, people of Chinese descent in America (other countries too but since I live in America I'll limit my discussion to America) and anyone who looks like they are of Chinese descent is going to take it on the chin until this ends. 

But a mystery that often appears in these circles is the question of the progressive movement; that is why they seem so hesitant to condemn anti-Chinese (and anti-Asian) sentiment, despite their supposed values. The answer is simple: they're not immune to the sharpening of the friend-enemy distinction and quite frankly many white progressives (and this is a very white group: https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/11/09/progressive-left/) have a great deal to gain from the displacement of Asian Americans. First and foremost, progressives consider themselves to be Americans and will agree with who America's enemies are. Because progressivism in the US is not fundamentally tied to a broad anti-imperialism (see the fact that AOC's inability/unwillingness to vote against funding for the Israeli military did not really lead to a major backlash among her base), progressives do not need to oppose it to maintain their credibility among their supporters, so they won't expend political capital/energy on doing so, though they might say a few words against ""Asian hate"", a term that actually serves to hide the real origin of the ongoing crisis. 

Secondly, white progressives are the group that is most in competition with Chinese Americans for lucrative/prestigious jobs and educational opportunities (med school spots, graduate school, tech jobs, big law jobs, elite university admissions, etc) requiring higher education (self-identified progressives are the most educated group https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/11/09/progressive-left/). The persona non grata-fication of Chinese and Chinese Americans will therefore make more of these spots available to white progressives, much like the internment of Japanese Americans was pushed for and taken advantage of by white Californian farmers during WW2 (https://qz.com/1201502/japanese-internment-camps-during-world-war-ii-are-a-lesson-in-the-scary-economics-of-racial-resentment/). They have strong economic incentives to allow worsening treatment and isolation of the Chinese population in the United States. More speculatively, if war breaks out, they may be among the strongest advocates of interment/ghettoization, ironically, in the name of protecting us from hate crimes."

>People also often make exceedingly racist remarks under the guise of hating China

Yup. When they speak out against the Chinese government, they always end up lumping Chinese people into a monolith and dehumanizing them. Assuming they’re brainwashed automatons, servants of the party and nothing else. I’ve literally seen someone say the quiet part out loud on here, that they think Chinese people aren’t even human. The soulless Asian is a stereotype as old as time. I’m not Chinese, but that kind of thinking was used to justify abuse of my Japanese American ancestors when we were the “enemy,” and the parallels are frightening. Sentiments haven’t changed so much from when Japanese and Chinese immigrants first came to this country in the 1800s.

Something that really bothers me is how treating Chinese people as a monolith obscures what really shouldn’t have to be said: not all Chinese people feel the same about their government. Tbh even if they fully support it, that’s no excuse for the way they’re dehumanized; they’re a complex amalgam of life experiences and ideologies just like anyone else. Like, god, why aren’t people just allowed to be individuals?

And maybe this is a controversial statement, but while some aspects of the Chinese government are abhorrent, some are far superior to the US. WE are actually just as brainwashed by propaganda as people accuse Chinese mainlanders of being, and we’re conditioned to ignore, or even support, our government’s own abhorrent actions. For every anti-China propaganda talking point these people spew, there are a million things just as bad going on right now in the West. That’s not to defend the CCP at all; I don’t support the government and I do want to acknowledge the terrible things it does. But that does not reflect at all on the average Chinese person. Imagine if people from other countries assumed we were all just like Trump?

People with Asian faces shouldn’t have to get beat in the street by police in HK while protesting the Chinese government or pledge allegiance to the American flag (🤢) to be seen as human. These racists don’t understand just how much this all contributes to anti-Asian hate and violence in the US. When Chinese people simply existing is an affront to America, of course it’s easy for to people to look they other way when they’re mistreated in this country.

Honestly this shit is what drove me off Reddit for years, the Sinophobia is worse here than almost any other social media platform. The irony of accusing other people of being brainwashed, lol"
19,v8k0p1,"The amount of sinophobia is just insane and so frustrating and disheartening. Everybody online is about “Stop Asian Hate” and also “fuck China and the CCP, if you’re Chinese and aren’t denouncing the CCP right this instant, you’re an enemy and a terrible person!” like the hypocrisy makes me want to pull my hair out. My dad even told me to not tell people I’m from Mainland China in public now. 

As a Chinese-Canadian, I want to be neutral and see both sides without any influence of anti-China or anti-West propaganda. But the audacity of non-Chinese people in the West who know nothing but Western media commenting on China, our history, Tiananmen Square, etc. is so fucking annoying. 🙃"

21,v8k0p1,I am Chinese American and I feel like this post so much. I always feel so alone. Growing up in a white town and having to face racism almost every single day in high school. I literally hated myself so much for being Chinese that I would disassociate myself from my Chinese side and go out of my way to “act white”. I remember when I was young one time I tried to scrape off layers of my skin thinking it would turn white and I would finally “be normal”. I second the commenter that wrote this is going to be my comfort post. I accepted my Chinese side but I still find it so difficult to combat the anti-China hate. Trying to explain my experiences living in China people and my love for Chinese culture is just constantly criticized and ridiculed. I am constantly told I am lying and that China is a disgusting place with dirty people who are sheep and only follow CPC. I am told that I am brainwashed and a spy. It’s hard to love yourself when the world hates such a big part of your identity.
22,v8k0p1,Seem like we are getting shit from both sides of the spectrum nowadays. The right has already dislike us. Now it seems like the progressive left as well. Although they dislike us for different reason. Things like doing to well and having to many Asians in schools. For example our city recently recalled school board  call Asian house ni\*\*ers and that we use white supremist thinking to get ahead. She also stated that merit based admission is racist. I just kind of amaze me that a so call progressive can say this out loud on twitter. Then she doesn't apologize and double downs and won't resign. Like It kind of reminds of the behavior of a trumper. Then you have Chesa boudin Sf DA. That won't do anything about Asian hate crime and in fact we are racist for saying otherwise. You got all the progressive telling us how wrong we are and chesa is actually doing a good job. While our Asian friends and family are scare of going out and getting attacked. I think the craziest thing is that you got Asian progressive politician that support these people. They endorsed the no on recalls. While Asian overwhelming voted for the recall. Like these people don't seem to care what the people think. We are now best mentality.
23,v8k0p1,"One of the more egregious things is that most mainstream social media are left leaning spaces (except Facebook, and maybe TikTok). Especially Reddit and Twitter.

Even if you say the comment is written by a conservative, voting on social media is done by a predominantly left leaning audience and these anti-Asian and Sinophobic comments are heavily upvoted.

Doesn't the left proclaim to be our allies? Then why do they suppress us officially (eg Affirmative Action and its conjoined twin Negative Action) and unofficially (eg social media)?"
24,v8k0p1,"Yep, it’s absolutely disgusting and annoying. It’s become so normalized now in our society to the on China. It’s the one common thing that people of all races and political ideology can agree on.

25,v8k0p1,"Every time I go on reddit and theres some Chinese person in a video, I always know it's going to degenerates to ""LUL SOCIAL CREDIT -1000,"" ""China is a shithole,"" or ""Shitty culture.""

I hate it.

It sucks because I'm from HK, hate the CCP, but a lot of these threads from hogs that also ""hate the ccp"" tend to degenerate into racist remarks that go beyond just insulting the government. 

In my experience, at least, it's always been conservative or libertardian assholes. I still know people who think saying ""ching chang chong"" is funny. I'm in my 30s. Same friend that ""was mad that they made the GA shooting a hatecrime."" 

All my non-Asian progressive friends are very in tune with the anti-asian violence going on, as we have a lot of mixed and Asians in our friend group."
26,v8k0p1,"Where are all the progressives you ask? It doesn’t benefit them. Plain and simple. White people protest police brutality on black people because it benefits their own image in the long mainstream history of white and black struggles which are really class struggles. Is this true of all groups and people? No. I have certainly seen people come out in solidarity with Stop Asian hate and the displacement of NYC Chinatown groups, but those movements are specks of dust compared to the overwhelming vocal support seen by other movements that potentially benefits the protestors themselves. Selfless acts are hard to come by, and the self hating Asians who throw their own under bus to conform to a racist society are not helping.

Discrimination against any group is deemed acceptable if there is no backlash. That’s what these people are actually thinking but saying that out loud is far too uncomfortable. Blurring the lines between people and government helps them justify discrimination. Claiming that every flaw is a result of the CCP is a willfully ignorant stance that is supported by racist, the insecure, the ignorant and most importantly, propagandist."

There's a propaganda war going on and people are bloodthirsty. A lot of people struggled through covid, have cranky dispositions, and spent quarantine browsing the internet. That's where the hate festers. Goin outside in real life, most people aren't like this. 

I saw this video of a guy teaching a girl how to speak English with less of an accent. And the top comment was some shit about the government. 

Look at who is posting these comments. For every top comment, look at their account. It's usual global. Find ur peace of mind, understand its just how the world works. Countries propaganda other countries. Then wash your brain of it by watching some Chinese shows or music or something. You don't have to belive all you read online but u also don't need to persuade others they're wrong.

Also: if you browse the league of legends sub, it's more balanced. Somebody will be like, ""LPL CCP CRACKS DOWN on streamer"" and then all the comments will be providing more context that makes it seem much less outrageous.

31,v8k0p1,"You first need to understand that 99% of all ""anti-racism"" expression is virtue signaling. This is why ""racism"" is so highly selective about which races are protected and which are ignored.

You only score virtue points if you're defending the ""good"" races. No one cares about you defending the ""bad"" races, those being Russians and Chinese, or anyone else from a country that is aligned against US interests.

*Anything* associated with China is implicitly bad and evil in the minds of nearly all Westerners and West-aligned Asians. You are not only guilty until proven innocent, you're just guilty, period. Any evidence that you present to prove your innocence is just further evidence of guilt, because any and all news, statistics, and data that is favorable towards China is automatically Chinese propaganda, and you're a ""wumao"".

\--

There is no way out of this, and things will only get worse because tensions continue to rise everyday, and *will* escalate to war.

Just this very day, June 17th, the Chinese navy launched its 3rd aircraft carrier. Everyone assumed it would be named the ""Zhejiang"" or ""Shanghai"" based on where it was built (port of Shanghai). Instead, its name was revealed to be ""Fujian"", the province closest to Taiwan. The writing is on the wall.

What do you think is going to happen to you and your family when war finally comes? What happened to the last group of East Asians who had the misfortune of living in the US when their native country was fighting a life and death struggle with the US?

\--

So what can you do? There's only the thing. Activism is not going to work, it never does. Instead, do what I did, move back to China, or Hong Kong. It's easier than you think and life here (I'm in HK) is better, safer, and more meaningful than living anywhere in the US.

We have to face reality - Americans hate us, maybe not *all* Americans, but more than 99%. It's been like that since the mid 19th century, which is why the Chinese remain the only nationality to be singled out and have a law passed against it (Chinese Exclusion Act). This law wasn't repealed until *1944*, 3 years *after* the US and China allied to fight Japan.

What do you think you will get out of life in the US anyway? It's a broken country with a beaten down populace. There's a reason why they're called ""Doomers"". It's a sinking ship, and you're the least favored rat left aboard.

\--

One final note, something to put things into perspective:

**WE ARE THE MAJORITY.**

There's 1.5 billion of us, and less than 800 million of them (US + EU + Japan + SK). We outnumber them almost 2 to 1, and history is on *our* side. China didn't flourish for 5,000 years by accident. We were the envy of the world, the model for all of East Asia.

We've always been the largest and richest civilization until very recently, and soon we will be once again. *This* is why the white world hates us, their leaders know what is coming, and all they can do to stop it is to smear our name and weaponize their racism."

White people who hate the Chinese typically do it out of ignorance and fear. Fear of the collective and all that. But the Taiwanese… its a very, very informed hatred. And that is far more severe.

But Asian Americans don’t necessarily need to carry the burdens of our parents. I don’t hate the Mainlanders like my grandparents do. I learned Chinese (not Taiyu, sadly…) and I’ve done the China tour. And the truth is that I’ll never fully accept the CCP anymore than I would our own government. Its just too much.

Then, there's the dumbass claims about Chinese culture and how it is ""in the culture to not help others"" and how it is ""in the culture to steal"". What is even more stupid is how quickly people just straight up believe it.

I am rooting for China to continue prospering and I combat anti Asian racism whenever I see it online or hear it in my community. It’s time to change the paradigm and squash the reactionary right once and for all.

48,v8k0p1,"Well I can't speak about Chinese Americans more then what I heard from people who I met online from the USA.
Some things that stood out was:
Elderly people never learned English and are too proud to learn it.
New generation's are well integrated speak perfect English but many stick to themself still.
They often only marry other Chinese Americans or even better if it's a mainland Chinese person.
Also the lack of denuncing Chinese politics and often  openly support Chinese regime leaves a bad taste.
They can be pretty racist towards black more then white people are. 

Now to my direct experience in switzerland.
I come from a place with many tourists of which are Chinese.
I do understand they are probably different then the normal mainland person since they are obviously from a better earning minority who can afford holiday in Europe.
I could say a lot but... 
They are often hostile towards non Chinese Asian tourists. 
While they seem to love and kinda fetishise European Medieval culture and buildings and have a weird fantasy about it. Other European traditions they couldn't care less. 
They don't respect opening times, treat staff of shops and hotels and restaurants like servants. 
In one place all the toilets were not working cause they were defect. Chinese tourists filled them with toilet paper squatted on the ring and so on.
They treat public things badly and often damage them. 
They touch things where it sais don't, they even eat and drink in places where it's forbidden. 
They are loud where it sais stay quiet. 
If you remind them they are just laughing like they don't understand you but it's more they don't give a shit. 
They trully think themselfs to be superior to not just Europeans but every other race or country. 
And it's all low key and well covered not blunt openly but subtle signs that you need to watch and then you see how they sometimes walk through places and not appreciate the culture but make remarks or make fun of it as of to remind the self how much more superior they are. 
While I do know the past and its harsh time China had under European rule its worrying in what direction they go. 

Mainland China has a rly strong nationalism that grows more and more to a unhealthy state. While they can be rightfully proud of what they are as a nation and its history. The current state I don't approve of. The hostilty to foreigners living in China and hardship to live there in the first place. The bullying of smaller Asian countries to trying to force Han Chinese culture onto them. 
The covered up foreign help in African states when in reality its worse then colonialisation of Europeans. Especially considering in what time we life and how they treat them. Sadly those states allowed it to happen cause they were so focused on the bad European from the past let their guard down. 
They openly call. Black people monkeys and apes. Brutes and have streets where they live named monkey Street. 
They make fun of non Chinese in public television without them knowing where the put commentaries in bubbles etc. Even people who dedicated their whole live to study and appreciate Chinese culture. 

China expects to have access to all markets. While at the same time it's nearly impossible to have access to theirs. 
Here tho it's a big mistake of Europe and USA accept these contracts. 
They are even more dependant then we from them. But politicians beeing scared to missing out on Chinese market bow to many bad trade deals. 

Those were lot of negatives but you specifically ask for negatives."
49,v8k0p1,"Racism against Chinese people is so normalized because even Chinese people hate Chinese people. You can blame it on western idealism, but a lot of it is also due to how different regions of China is. Plenty of people in Northern China look down on those from Southern China, and China on the spectrum is still considered more conservative overall with a large emphasis on classism. Even in America, international students from Shanghai love to say they’re Shanghainese, almost to show off a class distinction, and I’ve seen first hand how they can treat those from Guangzhou/Guangdong and looking down on them because it’s generally a poorer region. 

People of Southern China are more likely to have immigrated to other countries as well, especially during the cultural revolution and harbor some dissent towards their home country for essentially driving them out. They tend to identify more along the country they immigrated to, i.e., there’s a huge Chinese Vietnamese, “hoa,” population here, and they tend to identify closer with Vietnamese culture than Chinese."

53,v8k0p1,"Unfortunately things have regressed more in the past 10 years thanks to evolving geopolitical circumstances, which is the #1 driving force behind these mainstream incidences of overt racism rather than attributing it to some sort of innate tendency in people. 

The PRC, in a purely demographical sense, is the most prominent representative of Chinese people and their culture. Thus during the emerging conflict with dominant world powers they, and thus Chinese as an ethnic/cultural collective entity, will be inevitably antagonized. Just look at the things said about the Russian people since the recent outbreak of war in Ukraine. It has been clear that the Russian Federation, led by Vladimir Putin, has been at fault since day 1 of the conflict, but some of the mass media campaigns and the corresponding social media reponse have gone far beyond seeking justice for Ukraine. 

The PRC, IMO, should not be representative of contemporary Chinese culture and it is actively hindering the development contemporary Chinese culture. However the average populace outside of the East/Southeast Asia sphere are not capable of understanding any of the nuances in this, just as they are unable to understand any of the nuances in pretty much everything else in this world or around their lives. Since mass media's foremost priority is viewership and attention rather than reporting and properly presenting the truth/facts, it is only expected that they will shape the narrative into something their target audience can consume, distorting the facts in the process and inciting Pavlovian responses of hatred and fear."
54,v8k0p1,"1. What would you said the difference is between criticizing China's government and racism towards Chinese Americans/Asian Americans?
2. I find this post extremely interesting as a black American currently in China, because most people think I am african and don't even know that there are black people in America, but when they do it's 美国黑人歧视亚裔， 美国白人歧视黑人
3. Not to divert the message in this post, but would you condemn the blatant racism and racial stereotypes littered all over Weibo微博, Douyin痘印, and Xiaohongshu小红书? I hope that we all are against all racism.

Seems like most people in the comments at least actually understand that the racism really comes from nationalistic christian conservatives

In my experience in China, white foreigners are seen as being attractive and rich, while black foreigners are associated with being poor, ugly, and criminals. White people = 老外, black people  = 黑人

As a black native speaker of English some jobs in 2022 say ""sorry we don't accept black people""

I never see any actual discussions about racism and the idea of race, lots of Chinese men just say that black men are ""stealing""/ ""tricking"" Chinese women into dating, while nobody ever talks about how Chinese women or really Asian women as a whole are fetishized and you can literally look on Reddit at the majority of white foreigners talking about how easy to 'get' a Chinese girl, never seen anyone ever talk about the idea of ""yellow fever""

Nor does anyone ever challenge any racial stereotypes that comes from the West, it seems like people promote it and wholly accept it. So while some random Chinese guy online calls me a 黑鬼/ N word and that I should go eat fried chicken and watermelon, they most likely also believe negative stereotypes against themselves."
55,v8k0p1,"Usually when people say they hate China, they don't mean they hate the Chinese people, they mean they hate the Chinese government.

For the record, I am of Chinese descent, and I used to take offense when people talked shit about China, but then I realized what they really meant."
56,v8k0p1,"Honestly speaking and down vote me to hell if y’all want I can give two fucks but there’s disparity between Chinese people in China. How the hell do you expect American/foreign born Chinese to unify if within China there isn’t any unification? 

Each region of China is pretty different. Different idioms, language, mannerism. If you compare that to other Asian countries, that’s not normal."
57,v8k0p1,"Something bothers me pretty much is that - are people responsible for their government in any ways? It pretty much frustrates me that the Chinese friends I have are either rich enough to flee, politically numb or living in torment in China. I’ve never met anyone who wants to change this. I know there are, but it never materialized. As Taiwanese it’s what angers me most of the time. Hong Kong fights to change, Taiwan protests to change. But is there any force of change in China? As a Taiwanese I’m really tired of racism and im always trying to be aware of racial hatred and stereotypes. But a lot of Asians are suffering from Chinese government. But I don’t see how it’s improving. So I think the solution to your problem comes in two ways I guess. Make the country and government better if you care about what people say about your identity and stay vigilant while racism happens."
58,v8k0p1,so we are we just gonna ignore all of the territorial disputes that China is involved in? you ask why the world hates china so much as if it doesn’t try to start a problem with all of its neighbors around them LOL

Racism disgusts me. How is it even a thing? I can’t wrap my head around seeing a different race and being SoOo offended at them having a different color skin/cultural background as me and thinking less of them for how they were BORN. It’s insane to me and I truly cannot understand it even a little

Every country on the planet has racists but it’s seeming more and more like the vast majority of China’s population despise black people.
67,v8k0p1,"As an Asian (Thai half Chinese actually, not proud of it), these hates are kind of fair (except for the violence, fuck that) since most (NOT ALL) Chinese are the ones who cause all the hates themselves any way. They have been fed and taught by their government to be less humane, and more Chinese. Always shitting on the westerners, sometimes even their neighbor nations. They are always known to be selfish, misogynist, and even racist towards other in my country. They can choose to not take the propaganda into their blood and be a decent person, but they simply don't care, and would rather be pieces of shit. Don't get me wrong, this is not about American or Europe, this is personal, Chinese are like the leeches and parasites of the world."
68,v8k0p1,"yeahh it's crazy, i thought i was alone in thinking that there's a lot of racism against chinese people on reddit. and more than that, people on reddit are just generally quite insensitive, throwing slurs around like it's normal? i was so shocked when i saw a slur on r/memes and it hardly got any backlash (anyone who spoke up against it got downvoted, so uh)  
  
i live in a chinese-privileged country, so i never really felt anything till i started using reddit. it was an eye-opener i guess, made it easier for me to notice discrimination and subtle racism in my society (against non-chinese). at that time it was quite a lot, i felt like i was being criticised for having privilege and discriminating against minorities (not me personally, just chinese people as a whole. which is valid btw, i recognise that it's a problem in my country) while facing racism online at the same time :(

1,k7frna,"> ""...the director was like, ‘Hey, could you play up the accent a little bit?’ And I was like, ‘I’m sorry, I won’t.’ And then the guy felt really bad,” “The Lovebirds” star recalls. “And I was like, ‘No, it’s fine. I’m just not going to do it. If that’s what you want, I’m not your guy.’ And then that movie was hugely successful.”

Good on ya Kumail, and also it's nice to hear the casting director be at least sympathetic to his refusal of their request, even if they ended up just cherry-picking an actor with a thicker accent.

If you want a POC in a role, just audition POCs and have them be themselves; it's problematic to request that they pigeon-hole themselves into a stereotype you're creating rather than just letting people represent themselves as they are and choosing who's right for the part."
2,k7frna,"This is the reason why I respect Hassan Minaj. When he quotes his father in his routines, he doesn't resort to an accent. And the joke is still funny

7,k7frna,Another reason to like this guy. 👍🏽
8,k7frna," I'm glad Kumail didn't do that, though I don't think there should be any shame for the actor who did agree to the role. He did a great job in the role. Kumail did a great job turning it down. Both deserve praise and it's not on either of them that the casting directors asked for this.

The only people who deserve shame in this situation are the casting directors who asked them to do that. It's not smart comedy making some kind of impactful point. It's rude, it's racist, and it's shitty to tell brown actors they need to play up to stereotypes just to get a role for a cheap joke. It's racist as hell to ask brown people to exaggerate their accents to get an acting job. They weren't asking for an authentic accent; they were asking for a stereotypical representation. There's a lot of ways to be funny without being oppressive.

Also, before any of y'all chime in, my parents are from Bangladesh. I have every right to speak up about how shitty this is. I cannot tell you the amount of times people have made fun of my parents, looked down on them for their accents (when frankly, they worked sooo hard on their English and my mom even passed exams with high marks regarding her English capabilities) in the workplace and other places, and treated them like stupid people who should go back to where they came from. I can't tell you the amount of times people have made fun of me, even if I was born in America and don't really have a Bengali accent. Anyone asking Asian people to do stuff like this - stop. You're part of the problem."

0,mknc16,"A few years ago, Rihanna posted a rather questionable pic on her instagram, echoing her close friend's use of the racist term ""rice cake"" to describe Chris Brown's (who absolutely sucks) new Asian girlfriend. I'm hoping she has learned her lesson and this isn't performative, but considering [how the post is still there](https://www.instagram.com/p/Hsq4sRhM3K/), I really don't know.

Edit: I just saw clips of this person (who may or may not be Rihanna) sharing her IG handle with protestors. It's only a matter of time before someone brings this up to her.

Edit 2: I want to stress that **I personally do not want Rihanna to be canceled**. I want her to at least learn from her mistakes if she hasn't already. If y'all feel inclined to read about another celebrity who carried out serious crimes against the AAPI and the Black community and really needs to atone for it now, they are mentioned in the thread below.

Edit 3: In case you don't want to read this increasing long thread, it's [Mark Wahlberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Wahlberg#Legal_issues).

7,s76wal,"Funny this should come up today: I had a crazy experience around this a couple of days ago.

I’m half Asian, half white and look very Asian. My four-year-old daughter looks white but we talk a lot about heritage and there’s a lot of Malaysian/Chinese culture in her life.

I found her pulling the sides of her eyes up with her fingers while looking in my bedroom mirror the other day and thought “oh, _shit_.” She goes to an International School with a very racially mixed intake; I immediately jumped to the conclusion that  some of the kids had been mocking the Asian kids.

I asked her gently what she was up to and she said “I’m looking pretty like you, Mummy.” I still haven’t got over it - and I do need to have the conversation about why there are reasons not to do this thing and what the sensitivities are, but in the moment I was just overwhelmed.

When I was at school 35 years ago, that was the bullies’ go-to gesture. The really terrible thing was that I used to copy them because I had no idea I was the target; to me, my eyes just looked like…eyes in the mirror. The shame when I realised when I was a bit bigger what was going on was awful."

21,s76wal,"An interesting but perhaps counterintuitive trend I’ve noticed in the past 10 years or so is the more traditional “smaller” East Asian eyes are seen as beautiful and desirable (perhaps exotic) in the west, and if anything, it’s East Asian culture and media that perceives smaller eyes as an undesirable trait. East Asian celebrities tend to have larger eyes whether naturally or through surgery to align with their expectations and standards of what is considered beautiful, while here in the US, most Asian American celebrities of East Asian descent have “smaller and narrower” eyes (Simu Liu, Daniel Dae Kim, Lucy Liu, Steve Yeun, Awkwafina, Sandra Oh, Ryan Higa, Jamie Chung, Randall Park, Devon Aoki etc etc). I just think it’s interesting that our perception is Western media looks down upon traditionally smaller East Asian eyes when in fact it is East Asian media and culture overall that is perpetuating the issue."

It's far better than encouraging hate crimes against us en masse such as a certain COVID patient.  You can bet racists can't tell the difference between ethnicities when they want to attack an Asian person."

Every single kid in that group who bullied me was a minority, but what made it even worse was that the leader of the bullies was also Vietnamese just like me! Like he had so much internalized racism that he took it out on me, the new kid who had only been at the school for less than a year. It didn't stop until I was pulled out of the school due to my mom moving to a new city for her job. So anyone trying to claim that what I experienced ""wasn't racism"" can just fuck off."

I've heard all the same things except replace Japanese with both Chinese and Korean, in my case but it might as well be a script because the words and phrases are always the same like ""I've never experienced an Asian before...I heard you're all so sensual/tigers in the bedroom...you're all submissive and willing to please"".  

I hate to say that it's isolated to men of X background, ethnicity, socioeconomic situation, etc. but it's sadly not. You name a type of man and I can think of an instance where I've been harassed in some manner by one. 

For any trolls that visit this sub that need to hear this: fetishizing someone's culture isn't a compliment. That's just weird. And sexual fetishizing Asian women is not the same as respecting them."
3,hbld3u,"to whoever sees this: Thank you all for sharing your experiences, sharing has been a big weight off my shoulders. I remember when everything first happened, I would google and search to see if others had spoken up about this sort of sexualizing racism, and was never satisfied because there’s just not enough coverage and too much normalization of it. It just seemed like no one cared because it’s something that asians should get over or even “take as a compliment”???? it’s really sad to see that so many other people are affected in different ways. Thanks for being a community I can reach out to and receive warm understanding <3"

If I had a dime for every middle-aged, white asshole that did this, I’d be a millionaire. By the time I got to my teens I did not give a fuck anymore and told them if they spoke to me again they’d be wearing their testicles for earrings. I got a lot of “it’s a joke,” and I’d say that testicles as earrings is fucking hilarious. Then I’d get called a bitch, which I have no problem with.

I had one guy asking me whether it's true that Asian girls are tighter... a guy in London asked me whether I've ever had British dick. 

But I think guys with yellow fever dont even care what country you're from as long as you're East Asian or South East Asian. 

The most horrible thing I've witnessed was trading a chat from my Asian German friend. She rejected a guy on a dating platform and he went off! Telling her how she would be all over him, if they were in ""her"" country and that she shouldn't have such high requirements as an Asian girl."
11,hbld3u,"This made my stomach sick. I’m so sorry that happened to you. It shouldn’t happen to anyone for that matter.

It’s just wrong and you’d think the world could do better but some people just fucking suck. I never really thought about it until now but it is weird that categories like Japanese and Korean exist on porn sites. I get that it’s porn, but the fact they had to make it its own exclusive category shows how it’s basically a huge fetish. It’s wrong. 

I’m not full Japanese but I hope that in the future you don’t let anyone treat you like that again. You are a human being, and therefore deserved to be treated like one. Best to you, really."
12,hbld3u,"I’m not Japanese, but (unfortunately) share your experiences.

High school and college was full of “you’re pretty for an Asian girl” (which was SO toxic for my self esteem), “I’ve always had a thing for Asian girls,” “lemme guess you’re _______” (proceeds to guess literally anything from Japanese to Korean). Why do people/men think it’s ok? It’s actually the grossest turn off to hear a guy “only goes for Asians.”

Semi-related, but I’m sick of people trying to guess my ethnicity like is it a game. I’ve had some people who, while becoming good friends, were genuinely curious and I’m fine with that, but I’ve also had a fair share of random people on the street, at former jobs, in restaurants just bring it up. is everyone else turned off by this or is it just me?"
13,hbld3u,"(Edit: it seems like my post got autofiltered for including links :( so reposting the sources without, so hopefully you can look them up on your own)

You should be able to speak up, and you speaking up doesn't mean you're not acknowledging other POCs experiences. I feel like when Asian Americans share discrimination/racist experiences it tends to get gaslighted by others (Are you sure? Well that's not so bad, [Insert other race groups] have it worse.) You should look up OP-EDs on it, it definitely is a thing I experience as well. 

""The Slur I Never Expected to Hear in 2020"" on New York Times.
Theres a section where the writer goes into how when she shares her racist encounters with others and it gets met with downplaying or minimizing.

""Why People Gaslight Asian American Struggles"" on Next Shark.
There's a section on ""Dehumanization of Asian Women""

I wanted to add: We will always be seen as foreign, even when there's many who have been here for generations.

It stems from Asian Americans being largely left out of the US History curriculum. Most Americans aren't informed about our struggles and stories, ie. yellow peril propaganda against asian immigrants, Chinese railroad workers of 1800s, Japanese American internment camps during WW2, yellow power group working together with black power during civil rights movement, Immigrantion act of 1965, model minority myth, Vincent Chin etc..."

18,hbld3u,">I felt like I would be patronized for being silly and picky about how men treated me because “other races have it worse”.

Just because other people have lost limbs doesn't keep you from going to the hospital over a concussion. Same with racism, just because other folks have it worse doesn't mean you shouldn't speak out about your own plight.

And there's no doubt it's very real. There was a post on /r/iamatotalpieceofshit recently where people were decrying a racist attack against an asian woman... *because they wanted more ""hot asian women"" around.* I politely pointed out that positive racism is still racism, and the downvotes poured down on me. 

It's almost like the whites have decided that if they must stop treating blacks horribly, they must at least have asians to objectify and belittle. Mind you, BLM definitely has a long road ahead of them, but I get the feeling the perceived ""white plight"" is going to be taken out on us by the Caucasian community throughout the entire process, and probably for some time after as well.

To end this on an upnote: for what it's worth, there's a silver lining here, no matter how faint it may be. Because of all the other shit we gotta fight, I hear less and less about the Japan VS Korea/China hate these days. I think growing up in the US during the 90s, it was still here, but these days I can't recall clearly the last time I'd experienced it first-hand here in the states. And me personally? When I read this, I just see a sister that's got it rough. Maybe your great-granddaddy and my great-granddaddy fought bitterly to the end. Maybe that's true for all the generations before them too. But us? We stand together.

If you ask me, that's pretty awesome. 

Sorry, I've rambled. I'd blame it on my age, but I'm afraid I've always been such. **Bottom line:** We hear you. We sympathize. We gotchu if you need to vent or need help."

If we are more open about these issues, talk about them more, then maybe we can resolve them."
20,hbld3u,"\*repost :( \*

The amount of times fetishizers think they can get away with racism/perpetuating racism towards Asians is so normalized it's astounding.  And when we tell people that what they are doing is harmful, that it's racist, people shrug it off!

THIS is an example of what happens when people don't believe us. For Asian women it leads to not only sexual harassment but sexual assault. Asian women are already sexualized and treated without autonomy, but Japanese women get some of the worst of it because of some weeb's sick fantasy. 

This is NOT okay and I'm so sorry to hear about what you went through. Reading this made me disgusted, angry and sad.  And you are absolutely right, everyone would realize how messed up it would be if someone said the things you listed to another minority (and as it should be). We need to start calling them out more and shame them. 

Also, the reason why there's a porn category for Japanese and not say Chinese or Korean is because porn/working in porn is illegal in both China and Korea. My memory is fuzzy but I remember reading a statistic on the porn industry and Japan actually has a very large industry+ high consumption rate, 2nd to the US's level. I'm not saying that US porn sites are in the clear, as it's still messed up that they'd capitalize on racist stereotypes."
21,hbld3u,"You're American, and you're only as Japanese and Asian as others are European.

I have had way too many men (always Euro) tell me ""I gotta get get myself an asian girl"".

\#3 Why do you think it's okay to tell that to me

Also, it's gotten not so bad nowadays, but look around. It was, and it still is, without a doubt that asian girls were the most 'sought after', and Asian Girl and White Guy combo was the most popular takeout in the dating match.  


In a semi related story, I once read this book where an asian male gets into a romantic relationship. The girl asks him 'haha, have you never gone on a date before?'. The guy responds 'no, I haven't'.

Many answers I got are pretty normal, they have this attraction feeling, think Asians are more adorable or something. One guy told me his family had Asian students when he was growing up and that's what he was attracted to. 

However, sometimes, when I post something Japanese related, I will get more messages like “omg are you Japanese? I want to be with a Japanese woman so bad! It‘s been my dream.“ 


The disturbing thing is these weebos, they watch anime, porn, Japan also has this pretty crazy adult industry, so people like them, with no realistic thoughts in their heads, project what he watch and read on you. They believe that, Japanese women are submissive, when they say no their bodies mean yes, they are polite and “slutty“ at the same time. It's extremely offensive, gross, disrespectful. I am sorry you went through things like that, it's horrible."
25,hbld3u,"Def have dealt with this. In my dating days white men were always the ones with the creepiest obsessions especially the sexualization of race. Some POCs too, but definitely not to the degree of white men. To these men I’m only an object. I’ve only dated Asians since and race has never come up during intimacy. You really cannot fix these people without some therapy to get rid fetishes...my advice is to RUN. Bad habit are easy to fix imo, but when a habit has sexual roots like pedophilia or necrophilia I think it takes a lot to dislodge from a persons mind. The best response is fuck off."
26,hbld3u,">Think about it, wouldn’t it be considered super rude and weird for someone to go up to an african american person and ask if they’re specifically west-african?? and say how much they love fucking only west-african girls??? Or proceed to ask the girl to teach them to be like a west-african?????? and then be disinterested because the girl’s actually east-african?

Oh, trust me: that sort of fetishization happens with black folks a LOT, too.

Unlike you, I made the mistake of actually trying to flirt back with one of these people.

To put it nicely,  the woman I was flirting with was a little... ""not there"" mentally.

I know someone who's basically a Koreaboo, as they call it: she literally wishes she was born Korean, and seems to have a utopic view of Korean society, not realizing that, just like anywhere else, Korean society isn't perfect.

She'll wear Korean outfits, try to speak Korean to Korean people (even though all she knows is basically Google Translated, so she's probably speaking to them in a very broken form of the language), and for a while, she would talk about how her dream man would be someone who looked like Jungkook.

The sad part about this?

I can't make this up.

Lo and behold, she's also not entirely ""there"", either.

Honestly, I firmly believe there's a correlation between racial fetishism and some sort of mental or personality disorder: most of the people I've met who are like this tend to be antisocial and/or have violent mood swings.

Who knows why they do it?

Maybe, they get some weird sense of comfort in that fetishization.

Maybe, they see us as being ""easier"" than white people.

At the end of the day, I couldn't tell you why they do it, but I can definitely tell you the type of people who are usually the ones to do this."
27,hbld3u,"> I understand that this doesn’t seem like too much, but after hearing it for years and years and feeling like my ethnicity is just someone’s fetish, it makes me sick.

Please don't feel like it's not much. It *is* too much, because any is too much. A lifetime of these comment really wears down on you.

I moved to Canada when I was eight. The *nihao*'s started when I was 12. It bothered me, but it seemed innocent enough barring the fact that it always came from older white men. As I got older, the comments changed to be about how I looked. They also bothered me, but they were mostly complimentary, so what could I say? Plus, nobody else thought it was a big deal. Every once in a while, I'd get a comment that was more overtly sexual. These ones bothered me the most, but at least they didn't touch me, right? The escalation was slow and subtle; it felt like a part of growing up. I'm 29 now, and only in retrospect can I clearly see that these comments, the banal and the vile, all come from the same place. The strange man that approaches you to say ""You have beautiful eyes"" is the same as the one that says ""I've never fucked a Chinese woman before"".

When I was 18, somebody followed me and eventually groped me while delivering such gems as ""I've never made love to a Chinese woman before"" and ""Let me take you to a hotel"". After he left me alone, it felt like every dehumanizing comment I've ever received came crashing down at me all at once. I started crying and ran all the way to my friend's apartment. I felt so ashamed. Why didn't I do anything? Why didn't I run away as he was following me? Why didn't I tell him to fuck off? Why was I so weak? I vowed to myself to never let something like that happen again. I'd call out every comment, repel every aggressor. I'd fight instead of freeze. I'd unleash the years of suppressed anger on the next unfortunate soul to dare to cross me. But I didn't. Over a decade later, I'm still working on being more assertive. Having my boundaries crossed since I was a kid has given me a lot of things to work on as an adult. 

All this is to say, you're not alone. And thanks for speaking up about it, because it makes me feel like I'm not alone either."
28,hbld3u,"Employers and professional event hosts in my multicultural city have been actively addressing the fetishization of japanese female colleagues for several years.

This japanese female fetish phenomenon has been a plague to workplaces in my area after japanese foreign workers have been arriving in large numbers and the local population are overly interested in sexual pursuits with japanese women.

I conducted a deep dive investigation in 2018 to comprehend the root causes of the offensive behaviours in several workplaces that involved male and female colleagues sexualizing japanese women in ways that have to stop immediately.

The interviews and interrogations that I performed in 2018 found that the offenders whom dehumanized japanese female colleagues have unshakeable twisted beliefs about japanese women that purely portray japanese women as vulnerable open sex objects, and ignoring their individual merit in professional capabilities.

Overall, some workplaces and professional events that I am privvy to have noticed extraordinarily higher incident rates of sexual misconduct against japanese female colleagues.

Solutions are still being developed.

This fetishization is deeply complex in the workplace."

31,hbld3u,"I'm a Japanese American male.  I'd love it if women would hit on me.  But, seriously, I can understand this person's frustrations as my sisters have gone thru the same crap.  I remember once when my youngest sister came home in tears because some guy groped her on a crowded public bus and when she moved, he followed her and groped her again.  So she got off and took a cab home.  What angers me is that some riders on that bus witnessed what happened and said and did nothing about it.  My sister said that once she complained to the driver about being groped and he suggested that she get off and catch another bus."
32,hbld3u,"I’m so so so sorry this happened to you. This is a real thing that many, many women have to experience. This isn’t to normalize it. I’m saying this because it needs to be said. It’s wrong, and it’s a real trauma that accumulates. I have experienced it all my life. I’ve spoken with other women of different ethnicities that have experienced the same. I was told something along these lines just a few weeks ago. I flat out told him that being objectified because of my ethnicity isn’t okay. When I was younger, I just dealt with it. We need to teach every little girl better, so they have the vocabulary and the courage to not take that shit anymore. If we don’t speak up, it will keep happening.

35,hbld3u,I'm so sorry that you were assaulted. Nobody deserves that ever. As a fellow asian american girl I feel for you and I hate how some people don't even see it as wrong. Like they think it's a compliment or something...
36,hbld3u,"I felt this in my bones.  Two of the last people I was with before my husband (and one sexual assaulter who was Asian) were all people who told me that they had ""never dated/been with an Asian chick before"", so they were excited to be with one for the first time.  Like I was a conquest and not a person.  Like I should feel special that I was the One Asian Girl for them.  And unfortunately, I was not in a great place during that period of time, so I just took it as a compliment that anyone cared."

39,hbld3u,"> sorry i should mention that the porn thing mostly bothers me because i know a lot of people who would rather watch CENSORED japanese porn rather than just uncensored normal porn just because it’s japanese.

It's because unlike ""normal stuff"" the women are very submissive and it often features even rape like scenarios or incest. This is actually not allowed in ""normal stuff"".

Some guys really get off on the fact it's so much about dominating and a Japanese girl usually doesn't look like she's into it."
40,hbld3u,"I am sorry you're going through this. Unfortunately porn plays a large part in this, including JAV/Hentai made in Japan. Asian-American women and women in Japan are harmed by this greatly. ""Chikan"" (public sexual assault of women by men) is a huge problem in Japan. Japanese women and Japanese-American/Asian-American women are harmed by profligate racist pornography which depicts Asian women as constantly submissive and sexually available."
41,hbld3u,[deleted]
42,hbld3u,"I can agree with you. Living on a base for schooling, I always here a lot of people wanting to get orders for Japan and shit just to fuck the women there or stupid shit like that. Also for just anywhere in East Asia in general. I also really do hate it. As a half asian and half American, it really does make me want to just get angry sometimes, but I will still try to stay stoic and professional. I wish it happened enough for everyone else to start caring, or not at all, so people can focus on more about a person than what their ethnicity is.

Edit: looks like people might be misunderstanding what I mean by the last part. What I mean is for people to think more about the insides of the book, rather than the cover."

I can only speak for myself but it's hard to try and be concious about attributing sexualization to certain groups and I've tried my best to be wary about it. At the very least I'm really only into cute people, and I've met cute people from plenty of groups.

It's just a shame that the popularity of Japanese culture in some circles has this effect because I enjoy that media too. But most of the reason I got into it is because I was raised on Japanese media and food as a kid due to my filipino dad working in japan during the 80s and 90s. People should really understand that background doesnt mean you're attached to a culture. I'm Filipino but I find Filipino culture corny and def not something I relate to much, and most importantly the food is incredibly bad for me."

This is one of the many reasons we're both thinking of moving back to Japan in the future. 

I'm so sorry this all happened to you. I think the only way that this will get better is if the Asian-American community raises hell about this, and make everyone else realize that this is a form of racism, and that their ""jokes"" are resulting in people getting hurt.

 It's unfortunate, though, that Asian-Americans seem to be so passive when it comes to speaking up for themselves. I mean, it took a global pandemic just for some people to come forward, and discuss the racism they face. It's also really depressing seeing so many young asian women kind of perpetuate this by creating porn/onlyfans/etc that emphasize their ""Asian-ness"", or get into raceplay (I'm not necessarily kink shaming, but people are clearly taking asian raceplay too far)."

Then he tweeted “I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously, and have done a very good job from the beginning, including my very early decision to close the “borders” from China - against the wishes of almost all. Many lives were saved. The Fake News new narrative is disgraceful & false!”

Then he used a Sharpie to cross out the word Corona and replaced it with “Chinese” for his press conference. [https://twitter.com/jabinbotsford/status/1240701140141879298](https://twitter.com/jabinbotsford/status/1240701140141879298)

Spike Lee says in an interview “President Donald Trump needs to stop calling COVID-19 ""the Chinese virus"" because ""he's putting Asian Americans in this country in danger.""

13,fmd5jh,"What started all this is when Zhao Lijian made allegations that the US brought this virus to China. I don't know...maybe Zhao was trolling and Trump took the bait, but I'm reading that there's a propaganda campaign going on to blame the US for causing this outbreak. Probably to fire up nationalism and deflect responsibility for how things were handled earlier."

2,bm08p4,"For those who were wondering, I reverse image searched this photo and found that it was taken by [Dorothea Lange](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/aug/24/dorothea-lange-college-students-from-carefree-to-indefinite-incarceration), one of the most important American photographers of the 20th century and best known for her photo Migrant Mother during the dust bowl. Unfortunately, it seems like this series of photos she took depicting Japanese internment were [censored for many years by the American government](https://anchoreditions.com/blog/dorothea-lange-censored-photographs). She took on the assignment because she was opposed to the internment and wanted to record the truth of what was happening, but military commanders realized her photos were contrary to their narrative and buried them. They remained largely unseen in the National Archives until 2006."

0,s3b09w,People forget Asian Americans are just as ingrained in American culture/ lifestyle as other minority groups and yet we're perpetually seen as outsiders.
1,s3b09w,"One of the most interesting facts I've learned in Asian American history is that Chinese people have always been around.  There were Chinese in both sides of the Civil War.  Also, you can go to any country in the world and Chinese people are there.

We tend to associate Chinese Americans with the CA Gold Rush and Pacific Railroads, as well as Korean/Japanese/Filipino presence with the Sugar Rush of Hawaii - but the presence of Chinese people in America is the oldest."
2,s3b09w,"During the mid-1800’s, the cities first Chinese immigrants were recorded. In a census taken in 1855, there were recorded 38 Chinese in New York, all males. In 1943, the Chinese were given a small quota. 

The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 caused a revival in Chinese immigration, and the community's population gradually increased until 1968, when the quota was lifted and the Chinese American population skyrocketed. New York City has the largest Chinese population of any city outside of Asia and within the United States, and is still a primary destination for new Chinese immigrants.

If you guys want to, feel free to share these images with other people or to other places, does not have to be the whole post. 

Asian-Americans have been in the country for a *long* time. This must become even wider knowledge."
3,s3b09w,"Oh, I’m a descendant of Fong See! So awesome to see my family represented in these pictures. I always felt unusual because all of the Asians I grew up with were either first or zero generation. We have lost our language and most of our Chinese culture, unfortunately, due to racist beliefs about bilingualism at that time and a desire to assimilate. This tactic seems to have worked too well, as a large proportion of my Chinese relatives are Trump supporters now…."

14,s3b09w,"I sometimes wonder why people ask questions like ""where are you (really) from?"" If their interest is not directed on the individual person they're asking...

Their concept of ""I belong here"" is weird... Do you mean you own land? Then a new resident who comes and buy land should a real American?

A person whose family have lived and only lived in the US for 400+ yrs can only vote once, same as the person who just became eligible to vote."

18,s3b09w,"Not a fan of calling it the 1900s...because that makes us 90s kids sound ancient, haha"
19,s3b09w,I feel like 1928-1945 was an easier time to be a Chinese-American. You could wave the Chinese flag as much as you want without any sort of political connotations associated with it.

0,io45kv,"Side note, has anyone seen the reviews on Douban (Chinese IMDB equivalent)? Movie is getting destroyed by people who watched it.

I remember seeing a promoted video post on twitter a few months ago and it was an interview with the European costume designer of Mulan. She claimed to have put in so much research, having visited multiple museums all over Europe. But like... why didn't they just hire a Chinese person to do it? Even me, with my extremely limited knowledge, can recognize how culturally inappropriate the costumes were in the movie. It was a sore point for Chinese movie watchers too.

It's like they just focus-grouped the shit out of it without putting people who represent that culture in charge, so everything gets muddled in the end."
1,io45kv,"You can get 2 versions of Portuguese, 2 versions of Spanish, and even fucking Finnish but not Chinese?"
2,io45kv,"That's really weird since the subtitles are already done. My family and friends watched it in Taiwan and there were Chinese subtitles (the audio was still in English).

Edit: I think the reason might be because Mulan will be released in China this coming Friday.

Since it's already streaming, high quality pirated versions are already out. But without Chinese subtitles, the thinking is that it would dissuade people pirating it.

I'm skeptical on that, as I feel pirates would still pirate and movie enthusiasts would still want to see in it theaters, especially families. However, I can see executives thinking this way."
3,io45kv,"As an avid collector of movies, it's frustrating how little support there is for non-European languages.  Initially I thought it was a region based thing, but then I looked up the most spoken languages in the US.  After English and Spanish, you get Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, and Arabic.  

In my experience, I have to go out of my way to find movies that automatically include Chinese subtitles - one of the most spoken languages in the entire world - and the inclusion of Asian languages beyond that is unheard of.

At least Netflix includes Chinese for its original content.  The fact that the Disney powerhouse couldn't be bothered to include Chinese subtitles for a film set in China is an absolute joke."
4,io45kv,Disney's recent remakes have all been soulless cash grabs. Why should we think this one would've been any different?

0,jom44o,Fucking crazy bitch. Keep crying because you fucking failed to get elected.
1,jom44o,"A message to Vietnamese Americans, especially die-hard Republican ones who think moderate Biden is a ""socialist"": this is what your politicians think of you, ""ungrateful refugees"" who ""belong"" in the third world and shouldn't have the right to vote. You will never be Americans to them, just ""third world migrants"" who ""cannot assimilate into civil societies"", despite whatever accomplishments you've achieved. 

It was never just about ""legal immigration"" for them; they'd like to see all immigrants deported back to where they ""belong"". Asian Americans are not safe under Trumpism. You too are just another target, and you too are just another savage who doesn't belong in ""civil societies"". They want to strip you of your rights that you think you've earned by following the rules and contributing to society. Viet Thanh Nguyen is an extremely educated & accomplished man, who has arguably contributed more to American society than most, and this Republican politician would like to strip him of his American citizenship, of his ability to vote because he's Southeast Asian. If he's not enough of a model minority, who is? They've shown their true colours now, and we can never forget."
2,jom44o,"On the bright side, she got fucking *wrecked* in the election. Also, she’s stupid because Asian Americans do not benefit from affirming action."
3,jom44o,"This is what we mean when we say Asian Americans will forever be viewed as “not belonging” to this country... our “statuses” are apparently in the hands of people who will quite easily admit to wanting to revoke our ability to be here at the drop of a hat if you don’t “toe the line” in a way they deem respectable. I’m absolutely disgusted by this rhetoric in 2020, we really haven’t made very many strides :/"
4,jom44o,"Where's the ""*Both parties don't care but at least conservatives will allow me to protect myself and don't pander to me*"" crowd?"
5,jom44o,"The concept of an Asian Republican in the age of Trump still boggles my mind. Then again, Asia has a long tradition of strongman leaders..."
6,jom44o,"Ah yes, ""provocative"" blonde white woman in the mold of Coulter and Lahren, looking to make those racist $$$. Good to call them out, but even better not to give them the attention they crave to keep their outrage machine running. I hope she fades away into oblivion."

15,jom44o,Posting shits is probably one of her deliverables that listed in her contract and connected to her KPI.
16,jom44o,"It’s even more shameful for this society to acknowledge pretty much everyone in this sub has probably gotten  far worse shit in what we thought was just a social gathering on just minding our own biz somewhere, and usually white folks that see it just shrink away or offer mild rebukes as if instead of a godawful clear slur or rant or even a threat of violence and death they heard it’s just a mild faux pas."
17,jom44o,"This is completely crazy and disgusting. There are many Vietnamese migrants in South Korea. Even the stupidest, racist, egoistic middle-aged men in this country don't speak such a lowly discriminatory word to Vietnamese migrants like that. It's very shocking that such a woman is a politician supported by American citizens. Hate her."

I can't count on one finger of a guard actually doing anything besides getting fat behind a security desk."
11,mg647e,This is ridiculous
12,mg647e,"I saw this video this morning as well as the brutal beating of the younger Asian guy on the subway. I’m shaking and can’t stop. My whole life I have experienced random acts of racism, absolutely on the subway but also on the street. Never beaten as bad as what I am seeing this past year in videos. Usually people scream at me. I have been spat on and yelled at, I’ve seen the same happen to my mom when I was a small child, in a packed standing room only subway car. 

And to be honest, when I remember these incidents, the bystanders who did nothing have hurt me a lot. I remember them looking at me then looking away if our gazes connected.  It told me that I was alone. No one cares. And the fact no one intervened for this lady and the man who got beat and choked out, it makes me so mad I’m shaking."

I'm fucking sick and tired of being ignored and people minimizing/gaslighting treating asian american attacks seriously and not recognizing it as an obvious hate crime with a misogynistic component to it, even if the shooter IS mentally ill, that doesn't handwash him of being a sexist and a racist."
1,m80hfp,"That’s why I’ve bought a knife, taser and some pepper spray. It’s not enough if they have a gun tho but shit, I won’t go down without a fight if I can! Truly fucked up we have to think and worry like this."
2,m80hfp,"I'm absolutely fuming and can't hardly concentrate on work. For quite a while now, pretty much ever since that guy had a 'temper tantrum' and knocked that poor man to the ground. I honestly don't know what to do about it all, will it pass? Will the country ever be the same?"
3,m80hfp,Yep. I feel exhausted outrage. If that makes sense.
4,m80hfp,I’ve lived in NYC for 16 years and I have never felt more hyper-sensitive about my surroundings than I have now. Making sure any person of any race doesn’t get too close and doesn’t look at me a certain way. It’s fucking sad and exhausting that I feel like this.
5,m80hfp,"This is why I am frustrated.

As  an Asian I grew up being taught not to escalate conflict, that it was  not worth getting into a verbal shouting match or fist fight over mere  words. That if someone wanted to provoke or bully you, then you ignore  them and just walked away. As an Asian I was taught the lesson of “being  the better man and walking away”. As a result, throughout my childhood I  was often bullied and insulted. I attended school in the suburbs where  there were only 3-4 other Asians and thus I was perceived as an easy  target because there was no one to “back me up”. However I endured all  that crap, because I knew the consequences of escalating into verbal or  physical fights can be far worse than just ignoring them. And if  everyone got into shouting matches or fist fights over insults, the  world would fall apart. Even as recently as about a two years ago I was  heckled walking on the street by someone intentionally blocking my path  while trying to confront me, and my approach was to ignore him and find  another route to my destination.

Now  with the recent attacks on Asians, the feeling is our tolerance for  other people’s abuse has been taken advantage of, and we are being  punished for our non-aggression. It troublesome to think that by  avoiding conflict, we have allowed perpetrators to think there are no  consequences for belligerenting Asians. That Asians will just keep to  themselves and just walk away, while the aggressor does not get  reprimanded. The problem now is perpetrators think they can get away  with more than just insulting Asians; but now also with robbery,  physical assault, or even murder.

With  the exceptions of Asian’s being Kung Fu masters there are no cautionary  stereotypes scaring perpetrators from attacking us. Hence why the  majority of attacks have been on elderly Asians. Instead we have  stereotypes that make them believe we are easy targets. Furthermore, it  seems like there is the sentiment if you harm an Asian, there are no  consequences; that you don’t have to worry about their friends and  family members enacting “street justice” because we are too docile and  law abiding.

As an Asian we have  lived our lives doing the right thing, only to find ourselves more often  as targets and victims of unprovoked attacks. Let me emphasize the word  **unprovoked**. We are not  resisting arrest, we are not committing crimes, we are not starting  fights, we are not participating in riots or insurrection. Instead we  are simply trying to walk on the street, travel on the subway, get food  to eat, or earn a living at our jobs. We are not asking for more social  services or government hand outs. Instead we simply want our fellow  humans to have the basic human decency to not prey upon the weak. That  is why the news coverage on what is happening to Asians is so  aggravating to us.

**TLDR**

We’ve  tolerated being hurled racial insults (being called the ""China Virus"",  ""Kung Flu"") because we are the better than our haters.

Now our most vulnerable are getting robbed, assaulted, and killed. And we can no longer stay silent."
6,m80hfp,"Honestly, I'm more tired than angry. .. I just want to make sure my family is safe not just from COVID but from any unnecessary attacks. I worry that when my mom or my in laws plan to travel, go take the train/bus that there might be a chance they'll get hurt and I can't do anything about it. And being violent on my end wouldn't help anyone. I don't even think my family would like seeing that. I just wish for a better solution. 💕💕 I hope everyone's families and friends are safe from any attacks!"
7,m80hfp,It triggers me so much seeing the rise of these news stories. I try to avoid it as much as I can but I can only do so much. I’ve had some sleepless nights lately and feel so anxious. I’m a small Asian girl so I’ve been harassed a lot by strangers. I’m too scared to walk alone around my neighborhood even in daylight. I wish this would all end. I’m so tired of it.
8,m80hfp,"It's disappointing but not surprising and that's probably the most upsetting thing.

Did we really expect anything else from a country where Indigenous women are more likely to be murdered or go missing than go to college, the police do nothing (or blame the victims), and most people don't know or care?

The cowardice and inability of people to own up to and be responsibility for their own emotions and circumstances is pathetic but part of a bigger issue of people displacing their problems, poor behavior, expenses, and emotions as the fault or problem of people of certain races who can't fight back is pathetic and depressing but nothing new in the US and it's not going anywhere unless we talk about and get to the root of the problem which is greater and cultural.

The microaggressions are there every day, the subtle racism is there every day, and a lot of people perpetuate those ideas and ideals inadvertently. Sometimes those attitudes are what people think are what's great about the US from a glance from the outside, and we increasingly risk these ideals spreading to other countries as well because people don't understand the greater impacts or implications of attitudes and actions."
9,m80hfp,Yeah I'm going to pick up Krav Maga
10,m80hfp,"Pick up self defense MMA techniques and go to a gym. Go get yourself armed, learn gun safety laws and learn how to shoot.

Try to curb that ""I'm so ready to fight a racist mf"" mentality though because you might end up on the news like George Zimmerman. Just be cool and collected, save your rage for convincing and persuading people about anti Asian racism and defend yourself/other people within your vicinity but don't go looking for trouble out of your way.

Not a huge fan of Andrew Yang but I applaud him for de-escalating a potential racist attack. Not every situation is going to be like that though and sometimes, you need to fight to defend yourself."
11,m80hfp,"I'll be honest I have not been angry this past year.

For me I've already spent most of my life angry and it's only recent that I've finally let go of all of it. I won't go into detail about why I've been angry most of my life, but one of it is kids can be mean man. Growing up as 1 out of 5 asains kids in school for years makes you a strange creature among children, and watching them grow out of it made me happy in the end, but it never resolved my own personal issues on the matter.

I had my own family to worry about providing for and making sure that should anything happen we'll be fine. I've been preparing for death for about a year at this point, and seeing it happen to my cousin ever so slowly isn't any easier. I just don't have the room in my heart to hate as I watch my cousin, who grew up with me enough that she's my older sister, wither away.

Writing this has made me realize my heart is breaking on me, so I guess I'm a bad stat to ask for this question. Sorry"
12,m80hfp,"It really saddens and angers me too. I'm glad it's finally getting attention nationally, but sad that it took a mass murder to do so. Barely saw any national reports about our elders here in the Bay Area gettting attacked, same in Socal and NY.  

What was also saddening was that the majority of the attacks happing on Asians here in California were done by African Americans. This really hurt me seeing that happen because so many of us Asians joined them for the BLM movements this past summer. 

We did have a walk of solidarity in Oakland between the Black and Asian community after a couple of the attacks. I just hope that in the future that all of us as minorities can come together and continue to work with each other. We are not each other's enemies."
13,m80hfp,"My martial arts group is basically family. We’re in the bay and All of us are Filipino, Korean, Chinese and hawaiian. They’re teaching free self defense classes for women now"
14,m80hfp,"Amen. So much rage. Rage at all the horrific violent racist acts. Rage that we have to be so aware and careful even just going for a walk. It’s like psychological warfare. I agree that the real change is if perpetrators think the law will actually come down hard on them or if there will be swift physical repercussions. There also has to be overwhelming social shaming around any anti-Asian racism, but that seems far away."
15,m80hfp,"I'm angry. I hope the shooter gets the death penalty. And I don't think it's getting enough press coverage.

If those women were white there would be 100x bigger reaction. Not to mention a presidential public address, a memorial, and national remembrance day."
16,m80hfp,I’m done being angry. I’m just making sure my kids know enough Mandarin so they can leave this fucking country when they want to
17,m80hfp,"I'm not so much angry but vigilant. These attacks have been ongoing for ages now.

I remember in HS early 2000s about race wars in SF at certain high schools. Black kids beating up Asian kids 10 on 1. Then in retaliation there would be 20 on 1 against a black kid.

A lot of my friends have been victims of black on Asian muggings/robberies/attacks. Me personally 2 times. Others 2 to 3 times.

I am angry but who can you take it out on?"
18,m80hfp,"I've been thinking hard about getting a gun. If they won't defend us, then we'll do it ourselves."
19,m80hfp,"It disappoints me so much. In the same boat as you, I'm normally a chill guy, but this makes me so angry. Every time I see a story about someone in our community getting attacked, it makes my blood boil."
20,m80hfp,"It's weird. My heart rate goes up whenever people talk about it and I feel anxious in a way I've never felt before. I think it's because I'm not used to people talking about Asian American issues so much. I usually just assume most people don't know basic shit about Asian American history and the issues in our community. I'd be talking to someone who is very socially conscious. These would be educated, intelligent people that I respect. And then they'll say something completely ignorant about Asian Americans. Usually, no one cares about us, and now suddenly everyone is. It makes me feel on edge. I'm constantly bracing myself, because I don't feel prepared for what people might say. 

However, I wouldn't say I'm angry. I think I'm too old at this point. It's hard to be angry for that long. You're just tired."
21,m80hfp,"Yes. I'm not scared so much as mad — very, very mad. So mad that now I feel like it's turning into exhaustion.

I check in with my folks all the time now and make sure they don't do errands without me unless they're heading to an Asian neighborhood."
22,m80hfp,I hear ya bro.  I believe you're not the only one feeling like you are going to lose control and go full on blind rage if you were to encounter a confrontation towards you or witness someone else go through the same or worst.  Just want justice with your boot stomping on that racist fucker's throat.
23,m80hfp,"The majority of the spike of violence can be attributed to uncivilized barbarians in cosmopolitan democrat run cities.  That is almost expected behavior.  But in general one must stand and defend themselves.  The passive asian has already been trampled once by the anglo saxon in the century of humiliation.   The anglo knows how to fight and is very willing to draw blood, in this sense the anglo saxon is superior.  The asian is very passive and is afraid of risk and ""wants no trouble.""  Stop begging for alms, of ""understanding"" and stand up and defend yourselves.  Let's see asians band together to defend their brethren in court for defending themselves."
24,m80hfp,The thing that angers me the most is a lot of AAPI hate is coming from people of color. Like don't you have your own racists to deal with? You are a minority and you know how it feels.

I’m kind of exhausted. I watched a video of an old lady attacking a racist white guy with a plank and it made me feel better.
35,m80hfp,"If you are angry channel it towards making a difference... acting violence on others is just an excuse and won't make Asian Americans look any better while it may make you feel better.  Channel it somewhere else and stay out of jail.  The judicial system will still hand it to us even with all this going on.

You know what one of the fucking worst part of this recent event is? This isn't the first mass shooting that involved targeting Asian Americans.

In [1989 Stockton California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Elementary_School_shooting_\(Stockton\)), a racist white man shot up an elementary school in Stockton California, targeting mostly Southeast Asian refugees. This piece of shit killed 5 young kids.

I took a long break from this subreddit because reading the attacks and other shit just keeps getting worse and worse since the pandemic started.

I fortunately haven't had to deal with any racist shit recently but I fear for my mom and dad who are more at risk of being victims of this shit.

I live in fairly progressive area but you can never assume anywhere is safe for us Asians in America right now."
0,vjxsud,"I've literally seen comments in /r/worldnews where some random nobody writes a heavily upvoted ""Trust me bro, I lived in [Asian country] for two years, here's how it REALLY is"" type comment and a person actually from that country responds with how inaccurate he is and then proceeds to get heavily downvoted with responses that are, verbatim:

""Just because you're from a country doesn't mean you are an expert on it. Actually I would trust the opinion of a foreign exchange student in that country more because he is being taught specifically about the culture that locals don't know about.""

I have literally seen these comments.

THIS is their belief. It's literally a ""white people always know better"" mindset. Because to them white people are the sole owners of concepts like free-thought and critical thinking and Asian people are liable to be brainwashed and mentally incapacitated. Only a noble free-thinking white man can come into a [non-white] country and enlighten the mentally downtrodden locals about THEIR country and culture."

3,vjxsud,"L O L.

Quick story.

Was in San Francisco ordering pho and as I’m waiting some white dude with his Asian girlfriend (wife?) asked if I’m from Vietnam. Nope, born and raised in the bay by Chinese/Vietnamese parents who left Vietnam during the war.

He proceeded to speak to me in Vietnamese, telling me how special it is to have “our people be here to make this country great”, talking about how United we stand type of bullshit. How he loves pho, how he traveled all across Asia. And the most obnoxious thing was when he asked what I ordered, and proceeded to tell me why pho dac biet was superior to pho tai. Bruh.

I’m obviously feeling awkward as fuck so I just say cool and scoot away and just look as his partner acknowledges him and seems rather proud of how he doesn’t see color.

Jesus fucking Christ.

This was at Miss Saigon on 6th street in SF"

Kinda like, ""Hey man, how ya been?"" 

A bunch of very angry K-Pop fans told me how wrong I was, and  that *they learned Korean* and my formal classes were wrong. It was wild.

I thought that was cool at first but then one night we had a conversation about martial arts with my roommate (who is Vietnamese and has a black belt in TKD)

She was constantly trying to correct us about our understanding on it, and even made the claim that TKD is of Chinese origin (LOL). She didn't seem to believe us when we adamantly pointed out that it's actually Korean. We got fed up with her and kicked her out of our apartment."

9,vjxsud," I'm in this Korean self-study/cultural-interest discord group. When people found out I was Korean-American, they first asked me to help answer some ""culture questions"" that turned out to be 100% questions and answers drawn from Kpop and Kdrama.  The wild thing was when people talked about what level of politeness you'd speak among family members and people argued with me! About how I speak. With my actual Korean family. Wow. 

I also need to stop hanging around Koreaboo spaces. I incurred a lot of recent hate mail from Kpop stans because I wasn't cool with them trying to ruin the life of a Korean-American journalist who dared point out that Big Bang members got jail sentences."

But that's rarely the case.

Most of the time, it's some mother fucker who watches anime to learn japanese, found kpop in the last 5 years and thinks they know everything about all of Asia and it's history after 1 week tourist destinations in Japan or S. Korea and some youtube videos.

I get annoyed especially when it comes to Asian politics.

18,vjxsud,"As a big bro/in between generation (between Gen Z and Boomer...oh wait I guess Millenial lol), I dunno what to think of this honestly. Its a conflicting feeling. When I was young, nobody knew where places like Korea were for example. Often get replies like ""is that in China?"" People would openly mock anything ""Asian"" and were far, FAR more ignorant about the cultures. But now, its not necessarily the opposite, but for some people at least, a novelty and enthusiasm. The thing is, its not that the people of my youth are suddenly being interested in Asian culture. Those people still behave and act the same. Some of my non-asian acquaintances similar to my age are STILL ignorant, and even dismissive of the new interest in, for example Korean movies. Its the younger generation that are interested. So I cannot necessarily say things like ""where were ya when I needed you?"" hahaha.

As with any phenomenon, I want to wait and see how this turns out.

Kind of a side note, all my non-Asian friends who were interested in my culture since the 90s and 2000s are the best homies. Always defending me and wanting to know about my culture. They were rare, and often mocked by other non-Asians being being dorks. I feel these guys are the true winners in some ways hahaha.

I mostly reject Chinese culture and social mores, but I like Hong Kong, the food, and Cantonese. I hold Western values, like the celebration of individual rights (LGBTQ is still held in an embarrassing backwards stance in Asia). 

So if a white person chooses to immerse themselves in Asian culture and try to teach me about it, I don't take offense. Why? Because I'm not being corrected on anything. I already have my own unique mix of culture that I am a master of. I'd rather *not* be seen as the master historian of all things Chinese. Let someone else master it if they want, like Fuschia Dunlop.

""The best flavour is nostalgia."" Nostalgia not just for food, but the way things were when I grew up. I can gatekeep what *I* like the best, but if someone wants to eat their rice noodles with sesame paste, fucking go for it. Am I an authority on all foods Hong Kong? Nah.

Point being I am very aware of how cringey it is for white people to try and speak some other language in different communities. I live around a lot of Mexicans and I love Japanese and Chinese culture; in fact I love it so much more than American culture.

My opinion overall is that: it is beautiful to me that finally some people are beginning to understand how other cultures are amazing.
Wherever you come from: we can appreciate aspects about each other that we were previously unaccustomed to.

Maybe it is cringe but a small amount of my faith in humanity is restored when I think about how our cultures can combine.

And maybe one day we can all live as one; living in harmony."

0,g5zmtq,John Cho has always been on point; I appreciate that he didn't sacrifice his Asian identity in forging his career.
1,g5zmtq,">I came to this country in 1978, at the age of 6. I was naturalized on Nov. 21, 1990,

Imagine how vexing it is for us whose families have been here for generations (arrived in the late-1800s in my case), having to perpetually demonstrate that we're just as American as any other American. I wasn't quite sure what to make of it, for example, the first time I was ""complimented"" on how well I spoke English. In regard to ""Model Minority"", I've long said that we're only allowed such privilege as Whites are willing to grant as long as it's convenient, and that the label is meant to weaponize us against other people of color, and we *are* people of color. I'm really sick of the naive, ""but they don't mean us"", sentiment that some Asians have, as if we're somehow exempt from the biases lobbed at people of color in general."
2,g5zmtq,[deleted]
3,g5zmtq,What I wish Andrew Yang's op ed had been.
4,g5zmtq,"**Exactly!** 

Asian Americans are granted superficial proximity to whiteness through the model minority myth. (and simultaneously their own unique oppression is erased while cleverly putting them against other POC whose oppression is more obvious but that’s a story for another day) The ones who think this will insulate them from bigotry and cozy up to white folks are in for a rude awakening. 

You’re pushed away farther from whiteness the more convenient it is for the hegemony. Like what happened to the Irish, or Italians. (even when you’re closer, it’s just aesthetic) I dislike calling this “privilege”, because it’s hardly even that, but if it was, then that “privilege“ can be taken away at a moment’s notice.

As John Cho said: It’s conditional. 

I want to note that this also goes for liberal/left Asian Americans who are under a similar, albeit more well intentioned, delusion that we’re somehow more privileged/not oppressed and thus must concede all sympathy to other marginalized groups. That we must entirely focus our energy and efforts on being good allies rather than standing up for ourselves.

Our issues matter, we’re honorary whites until there’s an incentive to say we’re not (like with us becoming a convenient COVID-19 scapegoat), so don’t use our skin deep proximity to whiteness as a self-deprecating excuse to swallow your concern. Your anger. Your discontent. Stop elevating other groups before our own when it comes to *our issues*. No one else will return the favor and come to our rescue, we have to do it ourselves. Coalition building is necessary, but unity is a myth. 

To the Andy Ngos and Mark Tseng Puttermans of Earth, you’re a g$%k just like the rest of us."
5,g5zmtq,"Growing up in one of the red states, I have always felt conscious of my Asian accent and heritage. It was only I found out that no matter how ""American"" I try to be, I'll never be like my white or even black American classmates. So yeah, John Cho is dead-on."

2,mchx77,"Wow.  Thank you so much for sharing here. Sadly I'm not surprised. I'm so sorry this happened. I can understand your anger and frustration. It must feel threatening and unjust for them to stop you like that. Let yourself vent out that anger. Fuck these racists! France can feel like an unforgiving place to live as an Asian. Especially as an Asian woman because people love to yell nasty things on the streets.   
I'm Korean-American, and I was living in Montpellier in 2019-2020 working as an English teacher in primary schools. There were very, very few asian students in the schools I worked in. I had children pull their eyes back at me and scream and yell, ""Elle a le virus!!! Elle est chinoise!!!"" I've has many experiences of men yelling out at me in public. ""Salope chinoise"" was probably one that gave me a visceral reaction. As news of covid increased, right before schools closed, I was so anxious to go to work. I already stood out enough. I felt so sorry the small minority of asian students in my schools. I can't imagine what they have to deal with...Covid only exacerbated and perpetuated such encounters."
3,mchx77,"I am so sorry that happened to you. That is truly not right.

I feel like the Asians in the US at least have the numbers in our favor. There are many more of us here compared to countries like France. So it makes it easier for us to speak out, because we know we have backup.

A similar, but less severe version happened to me when I was in Luzern a couple years ago. I was riding the light rail with a girl from India I was sharing a room with at my hostel. Two stops into our ride, a couple of police officers got on. They were just casually riding, conversing among themselves, and a stop later, they noticed us and asked us to show our tickets. We showed it to them and they went back to their conversation. They didn't check anyone else; it clearly was a targeted check based off the fact that we were Asian. While it ended well for us, it still bothers me to this day that we were singled out like that. 

I can imagine how shitty it is to have it happen in the country you're from :( Hang in there!"

4,iutph4,"I did some further reading on the issue. The resolution to ""Condemn and Denounce anti-asian sentiment, racism, discrimination, and religious intolerance related to covid-19"" is a non-binding resolution to have all public officials condemn and denounce anti-Asian sentiments, and calls on federal law enforcement to investigate and document credible reports of hate crimes against Asian-Americans and hold perpetrators to account. It looks like this became a partisan issue when the democrats began to single out language used by the president, which the republicans began to defend.

The republicans' given reason for opposing the bill is that this was ""partisan posturing"" and that the democrats misplaced their priorities by bringing a nonbinding resolution to the floor when Congress has yet to come to a consensus on a coronavirus relief bill or government funding legislation. 

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy called the resolution a ""diversion,"" and said ""there is no kitchen in America that thinks this is the priority."" He also stated, ""At the heart of this resolution is the absurd notion that referring to the virus as a Wuhan virus or the China virus is the same as contributing to violence against Asian-Americans, which I will tell you nobody on this side of the aisle supports. What makes today's resolution is that it does not stop discrimination. It simply spreads disinformation."""

0,98kz4x,"I live in a homogenous, white-suburbia area, and what caught me off guard was how crowded my theater was. Only 10% of the theater was Asian, and yet every single seat was filled. If you live in Utah, you would know how impressive that is since no one here goes out on Sunday's.

I didn't expect to feel this way, but I walked out of the theater feeling proud. I'm not even Chinese/Singaporean, but it still felt like I was sharing all of these little cultural experiences with everyone around me. The scene where they had dinner at the night market made me incredibly nostalgic of Taiwan's night markets. All of the aunt's in the movie reminded me of my own Filipino aunt's who could sit and gossip for hours on end.

Loved the movie overall. Constance Wu is just stunning. Awkwafina was fucking hilarious. Just an all-around stellar cast. If rom-coms aren't your thing, then at least watch it for the cultural nostalgia. Doesn't matter what your Asian background is, I'm sure you'll find many things to relate to."

The theater was majority Asian, but there was a surprising number of non-Asian groups there. Not just non-Asian friends and SOs of Asian people, but groups of white and black folks were also lining up to get in. A lot of us are seeing it twice; one of my Asian friends is going with her entire extended family next week. All the aunties and uncles, just like in the movie, except they're just a bunch of Crazy Middle Class Asians. 

My least favourite part of the movie? How we all laughed and cheered so loudly, we couldn't hear the next line! I was told I'd cry and laugh, but I didn't expect to cry and laugh *at the same time*. Even my bf was holding back tears. He gushed about it after, about how perfectly the movie was cast and how the narrative pulled him in, and he's not a romcom dude. When the movie ended, the whole theater clapped and cheered. You can hear women *shriek* when Harry Shum Jr. appeared on screen (we would very much like a sequel, please!). Clearly, the reign of hot Asian men just began. 

As for the worries about classism, most rich people are seen as *fucking ridiculous* in the film, if not downright nasty and cruel. Nick Young's wealth, unlike Prince Charming, is not an asset; it's a liability to his relationship. All the displays of wealth in the film read as ""yeah, having this much money is nice, *BUT*..."". It's not seen as something we should aspire to at all. The only aspirational figures in the film are Rachel and her single mother, self-made immigrants who came from nothing, not those snobby, nasty rich people."

Well now we have this - we’ve got a turning point, and it’s up to us to continue the momentum for representation."
12,98kz4x,"Asian-American male born and raised in the US South here - decided not to support this movie just because it has an all Asian cast debuting in a white dominated Hollywood. 3 reasons below:

1. The title sucks. Casual movie goers who fail to research the plot will assume it’s about rich Asians that strengthen the model minority stereotype existing for Asian Americans in the US.

2. It was a safe bet. Produce a romantic movie with an all-Asian cast about a girl chasing a wealthy man with a mean mother of which these plots are beaten to death in K-dramas in a global culture that has seen the popularity of Kpop and K-dramas rise. Not to mention casting a male lead who is half white possessing Western facial features that is ‘easier’ on the eyes to the Western population.

3. I can see the movie being a detriment to ‘average’ Asian males that look more like your typical East Asian male with smaller eyes, rounder face, and modest household incomes. The movie sets unrealistic expectations for Asian men that further elevate the pressures of succeeding in a white-dominated corporate and professional world. It could also create fetishizing of Asians without proper credit or recognition of our cultures and identities  as Asian Americans.

Unless we produce a movie with an all Asian cast that depicts human struggles without stereotypes of being rich, having helicopter mothers, or exoticism, I will not support a movie with a lame excuse for a title and beaten-to-death plot just because it’s all Asians on the screen. It’s as if we are going to support it with obligatory intentions or for sympathy at a weak attempt of Asian representation in mainstream media. Clint Eastwood’s, Gran Torino, was a better representation of average looking Asians in a good vs evil plot."
13,98kz4x,"I personally don't like it. It's filled with Hollywood stars from various Asian backgrounds (Korean, Malaysian, Filipino) that have no relationship with Singapore. All Singaporean actors are subjugated to minor roles. I realize it's a Hollywood movie, and they need to cast ""big"" Asian names to attract an audience, but that also shows how few for Asians are out there.

The Singapore ""Singlish"" creole is, in my opinion, the best thing about the uniqueness of Singapore, rather than all the buildings owned by Americans and Arabs. They talk about the whitewashing of Asian-American roles, how about the Koreanizing of Singaporean roles?

But hey, baby steps."

0,uekdzt,White man also thinks it's important for you to know that he's dated or married someone from an Asian country that has nothing to do with you or the conversation
1,uekdzt,"The worst part about this IRL is that the people asking you questions like this are the ones who think they are the Asian allies and are asking you this because they want to prove to you and mostly themselves they're cool with Asians. These questions are almost always followed by how they love our food or whatnot and a lot of times it'll even be wrong.

""Oh you're from China? I love sushi, ninjas and samurais and anime!"""
2,uekdzt,"I need to remind myself to ask back “How about you? What’s your ancestry?” Like, they obviously asked this question because of how I look. I feel like an inferior when I have to answer this question while they don’t get to reveal theirs."
3,uekdzt,"Possible hot take but I wouldn't be offended if someone just straight up asked what my ethnic background is. To me that's less insulting that associating being ""from"" somewhere with bloodline."
4,uekdzt,170 years in America and still treated as foreign.
5,uekdzt,"As if White Americans wouldn't just start listing their DNA percentages. ""I'm 43% Irish, 15% Italian, 12% Scotch, 10% German, 3.43% Poodle, ... Let me give you my valuable insight on Irish politics"""
6,uekdzt,"Most recent experience was a guy insisting on where my parents were from. Why? Because he wanted to tell me about a Korean art exhibition. As if this information was only relevant if I was of Korean heritage.

Imagine if I insisted on someone verifying their ethnic background before telling them about a Picasso exhibition."
7,uekdzt,"My other favorite one is ""Have you been back 'home?'"" after I just told them I was born in Chicago.

More than once, with a completely straight face and not a hint of annoyance, I've replied, ""Yes, I go back to Chicago about once a year, sometimes more often, since I still have a lot of family and friends there.""

Which then gets, ""Well, you know what I mean..."" Yes, I do know what you mean, but then ask it the right way. ""Have you ever been to the Philippines?"" or even ""Have you been to your parents' home country?"" 

Even that last one is kinda iffy -- my parents are in there 60s, but they've been in the US since they were like 10 and 13. Of course, I don't expect people to know that, so I cut people slack there.

But even then, it's not like some Asian families haven't been in this country for multiple generations, over a hundred years. Hell, Filipinos might've been the first Asians in the US or even North America."
8,uekdzt,"I saw ""I am from Maryland"" though this was going to be a bad at driving joke."
9,uekdzt,"When I was travelling in Phuket, other tourists asked me where are you from. I said Canada. Then, they asked where are your parents from ? If I wasn't a first generation immigrant, that question wouldn't work. 

Canada has a lot of immigrants... I'm just not white. So, not canadian enough?

I was annoyed but I think they wanted to know my ethnicity. Instead of asking what's your ethnicity they asked me where I'm from..."
10,uekdzt,"The parental fishing questions are funny as a 4th gen, because it's obvious what they're after when they ask about grandparents and I can still chirp, ""oh, the midwest~""

12,uekdzt,I have a friend who’s Native American and LOVES to play this game since people usually exhaust every foreign country they know.
13,uekdzt,"This takes me back to being asked this question at the bus stop before even being greeted with Hello.

Depending on my read of the situation I would do passive aggressive stuff like pretend I didn't understand the question ""wot I live here"" ""I don't know you"" ""how is this relevant?""  ""Bless you."""
14,uekdzt,If the first thing they want to know about me is my race then I don't really want to get to know them.
15,uekdzt,I don’t even get asked where I’m from sometimes. I get “what are you?” “Uhhhh….human I think?”
16,uekdzt,Mood. Why are people so stupid.
17,uekdzt,"This is probably the most annoying microsggression, but its honestly not even just from white people. I have other Asians ask me the same question in the same way. It always makes me feel confused and uncomfortable to answer because I'm not sure what they're really asking. I much rather have people ask me about my ethnicity if that's what they really want to know."
18,uekdzt,This gotta be the most relatable thing I’ve seen in a while
19,uekdzt,I finally understand why people always go ‘oh’ when I say I’m from Idaho
20,uekdzt,"I met one white dude that asked about my family’s historical nationality. Essentially, he didn’t assume if I was born in the us or not."
21,uekdzt,"In Australia, a lot of people would ask, ""What's your family's background?"" or ""What's your cultural background?""

I find that acceptable. They're not suggesting you're not Aussie."
22,uekdzt,"My parents came from a land where there's lots of street fighting.


Oh man.  Is this Vietnam?


No it's Los Angeles."
23,uekdzt,"I know if my white friends are 1/8 Portuguese and 3/5 Norwegian…not that the vast majority of them have ever been to any of the countries that they claim or have any known family members still in those countries…but I do know this extra piece of information. Many of them are overly proud of it for whatever reason. I only tell someone if they ask, but I never discuss it cause nothing about me from my looks, traditions, or even family name would give anyone any hint that I am anything other than your standard white mutt ‘Merican. 

My Latin and Caribbean friends will casually (and often) slip in bits about their favorite jerk chicken recipe, off collar jokes (I won’t repeat) related to swimming across the border, a Colombian cousin coming to visit. 

However, I know very little about my Asian friends. I suspect it stems partly from this kind of meme and the reason it exists in the first place. It actually took a few years to know one of my friends is Vietnamese. He was and still is a Texan to me. Someone referred to him as my Vietnamese coworker and I was like “who?” The person laughed like I was an ignorant fuck and said, “You don’t even know he’s Vietnamese? Look at his last name.” And, no, I didn’t know, nor would I guess it from his last name. It never came up. I told my coworker this story and he laughed. From that day, an entire aspect of his life was unlocked to me. He’s actually a lot more open about his family now than he was for almost 4 years of friendship. 

So, my question is…how would you prefer to discuss this topic?"
24,uekdzt,What about you white boy? Irish or Slavic?
25,uekdzt,"Once this line of questioning ended up with the other person asking me, “I mean, what’s your nationality?”

I was hangry and just trying to order some chicken (she was an employee at the KFC I was getting dinner from), so I sighed and said, “Do you mean my ethnicity?”

“What?”

“Are you asking me for my ethnicity because my nationality is American.”

She was so confused. Then explained that I have an “interesting” accent and I’m like, ma’am, I’m from Denver just like you, we have the same boring accent, it’s too late to backpedal. 😒"
26,uekdzt,"She could ask him where he's originally from

and he'll be like I dunno, I'm a mutt"
27,uekdzt,"Personally I don't mind if the person asking is a POC, because it feels like an exchange. If the person asking is white, I immediately get defensive lol."
28,uekdzt,"Oddly enough, I have only had this once. I am 1st generation from Vietnam. The people in my community have had it happen more often when they don't have even have a foreign accent."
29,uekdzt,Just answer it then throw the same question back?  He’s not a Native American anyway
30,uekdzt,"I don’t know how to feel about people who act like “oh me/my family is actually X” is the solution to things like this, not all of us can run away from our Asian identity like that. My parents aren’t from the US but that has no bearing on whether or not any of us deserve to be here."
31,uekdzt,"Marylander here. For some reason the first time I saw this on a different subreddit, I took it as a critique about how many people who live in Maryland didn’t grow up here. But that’s because I read the words before looking at the pictures."
32,uekdzt,"Totally anecdotal, but is it just me or are white women a bit better about this on average? Most of my encounters with white women have been less egregious in terms of cultural appropriation and exoticization with the ""worst"" thing being asked out for a boba date. 99% of the time, it seems so normal that I can't even think of anything to write about here."
33,uekdzt,"“What does that matter?” Is my answer. “How is that your business, fuck off” is another good one."
34,uekdzt,"The first time somebody did this to me, was when I was a kid.  I visited Vancouver, BC, and another asian kid asked me where I was from.  I said California.  Then when she asked again I said San Francisco.  I couldn't understand why she kept asking me lol"
35,uekdzt,"To be fair, ""what race are you,"" sounds more uncouth even if it's more direct.

I'd feel less comfortable with that."
36,uekdzt,"Funny thing is, I was asked this by an another Asian person. She did not believe I was born in America, and complimented me on my accent."
37,uekdzt,"I've finally stopped getting,  ""You're not Asian.  You're Indian. """

2,pgzasz,Awesome. I booked a private theatre and invited 20+ friends. Stoked.
3,pgzasz,Thats really nice of you! Thank you!
4,pgzasz,Already watched it but want to says thanks for doing this! (Especially to get the opening weekend numbers up) Great movie!
5,pgzasz,That's so nice of you! This subreddit is probably one of the most positive ones out there.
6,pgzasz,You’re awesome for this!
7,pgzasz,"Thank you so much for doing this!

We need a modern age Asian hero.  Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan are so long ago.. We have Steven Yuen, but he's kind of on the peripheral."
8,pgzasz,Respect
9,pgzasz,Quite generous of you!
10,pgzasz,"This is really awesome. I donated to the gofundme to send AAPI kids to see the movie and really hope that more youth get the opportunity to see people who look like them in movies and TV.

u/lenaxia I'll shoot you a PM about sending you a free Shang-Chi enamel pin that I just designed and released!"
11,pgzasz,"You're awesome for this. We need to support this movie. We need to show Hollywood how much demand there is for movies with asian stars. We need to support Simu Liu, we need to make it known this is our time.

Don't be a dick, don't pirate this. This is the one time it's okay to give money to ""The Mouse""."
12,pgzasz,"This is awesome to hear, I'd absolutely love to get a pair of tickets for my buddy and I to see it. We both want to watch and support it, but tickets going for $15+ in my area hurts the wallet a bit."
13,pgzasz,Very nice of you to do this!
14,pgzasz,"Wow! That's incredibly generous! I wish I that I could take up the offer, but I'm primary caregiver for my dementia-ridden mom, and we only have an outside caregiver to provide me with some relief on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. Unfortunately, I'll likely have to wait for Shang Chi to either hit a streaming service or to be released on Blue Ray/DVD. I've always appreciated the character, however. There was a period way, way back when he was drawn to look like Bruce Lee. From what I've seen, Simo seems to do a good job. I haven't researched it yet, but I'm curious as to whatever in which training, and style, he might have had prior or what he received for the film. I've always been partial to Choy Li Fut."
15,pgzasz,"I wanna see it but I am tad under the weather, I did get vaxxed however, I have to take care of my kids and no we won't hire a babysitter. 

that being said, I will have to wait when it goes on DIsney +"
16,pgzasz,Hell yeah thanks for doing this. I bought 10 tickets for tomorrow for me and my friends lol.
17,pgzasz,Thank you for doing this! The movie was SO MUCH FUN! I can't wait to watch this again on Monday if I can convince the family to come with me.
18,pgzasz,That's so cool you're doing that for people!:)
19,pgzasz,This is really awesome and such a nice gesture that your doing OP 👏. I couldn't help but smile after seeing this post.
20,pgzasz,y’all I really love our community like we really out here supporting each other like this 😭👌
21,pgzasz,dammit.  Wish I saw this message before I bought the tickets.
22,pgzasz,"For helping others, thank you"
23,pgzasz,"That’s so sweet of you to offer this opportunity to the less fortunate members of the community!

I plan to go and see the film hopefully either tomorrow or next weekend with some friends when we get some time off from our college orientation at the end of the day. I’ve been hyped about this film for a while, so I’m going in with high hopes! :)"
24,pgzasz,DM me if you use Fandango and want 2 tickets on me (claimed!)

0,guv4bo,"That’s cuz they never cared about HK people in the first place lol. They were nothing but pawns to these asshats. Remember they kept peddling how “Trump is hard on China” narrative? It’s a tactic to make him look good.

There’s also an element of racism too, especially towards Chinese people. Combine that with HK people waving American and British flags, also justified their white savior complex. There were a lotta talks from them about “see colonialism isn’t bad. HK is where it is because of British colony.” Combine all that. You’ll see why they supported HK.

Also relating to NBA, they wanted to use HK situation to undermine Black athletes from speaking out against police brutality and etc in America. 

In the end, they tried to simply use HK to further their own agenda. Nothing more."
1,guv4bo,*white savior complex intensifies*
2,guv4bo,"The hypocrisy part is that for Hong Kong protest, people don't seem to draw the line between peaceful protestors and rioters. The police chasing down rioters who were setting fires, digging bricks from the road or attacking passing people who disagree with them,  turned differently in the media headlines that police were brutally suppressing the peaceful protestors."
3,guv4bo,"I know this is a meme but stop correlating protestors with rioters ffs. Some protestors may be involved but correlating damage to all protesters is dangerous.

**You can support THE CAUSE without supporting the RIOTING**. You can support the small businesses being hit while supporting the cause.

Fuck."
4,guv4bo,"Funny, everything I've read about the George Floyd protests indicates that the protesters and looters are CLEARLY two distinct groups of people, while the Hong Kong rioters themselves go out of their way to avoid said distinction."
5,guv4bo,"I really like seeing the videos where rioters are being directly rejected/ousted by the protesters; videos like the one of the guy with the skateboard trying to smash windows and the protesters swarming him and taking away the skateboard as he flees and the video where the guy is trying to pickaxe the curb and the protesters grab him and toss him to the police line to be arrested.

I'm happy to see it with the Hong Kong protests and I'm happy to see with the protests here in the US.

Actions like that are hardline statements that those who attend or use the protests purely as a cover to light fires or loot will not be tolerated among the ranks of the actual protesters."
6,guv4bo,"Shame on you for equating the looters with the protestors. The protest organizers were speaking out all weekend asking the public to stop lumping them together, to STOP rioting and to KEEP THE PEACE. Listen to their voices!! 

Most of these mom and pop shops in strip malls that got looted will not be getting insurnace payouts because of covid, at best, they will be on their own for at least a year. Do you think condemning these families to poverty is the right thing to do? Many of them will never get back on their feet. We all know an Asian parent that put their kid through school from their small business. Maybe that's your parents. *That's* who you're hurting. You think people are mad about a Target? No, people are mad about the small mom and pop salon that has millions in damages because of senseless looting that **had nothing to do with the protests**. 

Check your privilege. A lot of these people agree that BLM, a lot of them are underprivileged immigrants. They're already struggling with covid, you think it's right to destroy these families??? Must be nice to smugly make this meme and have the privilege to perform allyship because none of this affects you at the end of the day. 

Looting and rioting have grave consequences and I invite you to do a little reading on the history of these places that have had riots. Do you think businesses returned to Detroit or Ferguson after things calmed down? No. They left. Why does that matter. Well, it caused loss of economic opportunity, unemployment, food scarcity, food 'deserts', racial inequality, lack of access of Healthcare, mass poverty--all issues that BLM have criticized as racial inequality from the beginning. 

The real world is a little bit more complex than this stupid meme. I'm sick of this type of performative allyship, and I urge you to listen to the leaders of the movement crying out in frustration that their movement has been stolen and hijacked by looters and anarchists. Don't legitimize it. Listen. 

Equality is not stepping on another to get ahead. 

You can support human rights and also support the most vulnerable of our community. These issues are a lot closer together than we think."

16,guv4bo,"I support the protest and this injustice is stunningly terrible, but both movements lose support when they turn to violence. Also, was the level of looting there in HK too?"
0,soge80,The media has done their best to 'disappear' Asian American men. It takes a lot for somebody to overcome that.
1,soge80,"It's comforting to be with someone who had similar experiences growing up as you did and you don't have to explain every cultural nuance to them. They just get it.

I don't think it's odd."
2,soge80,"My old girlfriend (asian) told me that she never thought she'd date an asian man. Not sure if that was supposed to be a compliment, or if I was supposed to feel good about it."
3,soge80,"I grew up in a diverse city and had had crushes on Asian, Latino and Black guys growing up. I wasn't surrounded by white people until I got to college in a White area, and media didn't really affect me much (maybe because I didn't hang around white folks so I couldn't really relate?)

I was a bit naive about fetishization until I dated a white dude who slowly let out his true self (e.g. hating on Asian guys while fetishizing them at the same time). Not saying that Black and Latino guys don't hold preconceptions of Asians, but it hits different when a white person does it. I think it's because in the U.S., white people (that are not immigrants) see themself as the default whereas I could start conversations with other races about being fetishized or stereotyped more easily because of the shared experience.

I think white people react strongly when I say I don't want to date them because they are not used to being turned down because of their race. They sometimes equivocate between Asian/Black/etc people choosing to not be with white partners with white people choosing to only be with white people. I'm sure that reasons vary, but most people of color I meet who do not date white partners just do not want to deal with the potential for racism in their personal lives since they already get that in their public lives. I also think that white people would also say that they find ""certain physical characteristics attractive"" to justify their racial preference, which may be technically true, but that doesn't mean that finding certain physical traits attractive doesn't have a racialized undertone or context."
4,soge80,Thank you for saying this out loud for me :) I am still coming to terms with this after separating from my (white) husband (I am Japanese) of over 14 years. I have noticed a shift and am so glad I read this today. :)
5,soge80,I say dating anyone despite their race is ok. But if you are dating white people due to your warped self identity it's not healthy. Personally I prefer dating Asians because it's easier to relate to each other's cultural background and the Asian American experience.
6,soge80,[deleted]
7,soge80,"Girl I support you. I'm going through this ""awakening"" and self realization of how programmed I was on ""white aspiration."" I'm trying to come out the other side of this process; I'm taking the time to really challenge all the beliefs I have about myself. I'm in no rush to make a definite statement. I'm allowing my attraction to people be more fluid."
8,soge80,"I’m in my 30s and still working to overcome this innate bias Ive had toward Asian men. Popular media created terrible narratives for us all growing up. 

There’s a great invisibilia podcast episode featuring the same topic I highly recommend: https://www.npr.org/2019/04/04/709948132/a-very-offensive-rom-com 

It features an Asian woman who actively chose to date only non white men for a period of time and shared her experience."
9,soge80,"I'm not against dating anyone but I'm definitely aware of how the media portrays certain ethnicity men vs. others. I think Asian men are starting to be more represented in the media but it's nowhere near where they should be. Unfortunately it will likely take Asians being decision-makers to make that happen and we're just not there yet, at least not in America. 

Kudos to you for recognizing you used to be that toxic Asian girl and for fixing it. I had that phase in high school but moved past that in college."
10,soge80,you got a ton of DMs from white men? I wonder how many lurk on asian spaces like this
11,soge80,"Same, but with white women. Didn't know how much I was missing the shared cultural experiences / empathy / struggle of being Asian in the US. I think I had a really hard time communicating them with my former partner and, when I did, I'd sometimes get gaslit on them ""not seeing the big deal"".

Also the really toxic and tacit mentality of ""I'm dating a white person so I've made it."" White aspiration indeed, well-put."
12,soge80,"It’s not weird lol. I also have and will keep rejecting white guys who I think have some sort of fetish towards Asian women or think we’ll be more subservient or some shit. Whenever I try to look up any blogs of Asian women rejecting guys like this, I see none lol.."
13,soge80,Is anyone else disgusted by the white guys replying to this thread having no shred of respect + makes it about themselves? I saw a couple of really dumb comments and it's just sad to realize this is the world we live in.
14,soge80,"I've found that female  (North- and South-) East Asian relatives/friends/classmates/colleagues who grew up on popular Asian media have always had a preference for East Asian men. Some of them have told me white dudes look strange/unappealing without the ""Hollywood halo effect""."
15,soge80,Pursue your happiness
16,soge80,"I think the problem with straight white men is they don’t have ANY kind of hardships. White women “get” sexism, gay white men “get” homophobia, even if they can never fully “get” what racism feels like, they at least can conceptualize “hey I’m being treated unfairly because of something beyond my control and this sucks”.  


Straight white men have no way to relate. I do think the ones who eg grew up poor and made it in life are somewhat better, they can at least understand hardship. But your median white dude literally just has no clue, no reference point, oppression in society is invisible to them."
17,soge80,So glad more and more Asian women are starting to come to the realization that fetishization/racism/self hated is a real thing and how damaging it can be.
18,soge80,"As a guy, I've stopped dating white women.

Tired of the tone deaf attitudes and going out with a POC, its easier. There's less to explain and there's an acknowledgement of things without having to talk about it."
19,soge80,"I grew up in a pre-dominantly POC area. My catholic school was 98% African American students. I was the one token Asian in my class and there was one token white person. In high school and college I dated Asian, black, Persian and Hispanic men. I didn’t really start dating white men until my late 20s and early 30s. 

I definitely notice a difference from dating minorities and WM. It’s not only the fetishization, but also the overt racism. The dating experience was more of a field trip for me because growing up I didn’t see a ton of racist behavior towards Asians until I started dating WM. The worst behavior I experienced was from a mutual friend, who I turned down. I’ll never forget what he said to me when I turned him down, “I’m white, you’re supposed to want to date me. All Asian women love me. You won’t find anyone better than me.” I beat him up with my purse. Yes, this prissy little racist bitch threatened to call the cops on me but I crushed his dignity.

But at the end of the day, I always knew I would marry an Asian man."
20,soge80,[deleted]
21,soge80,"My self-esteem and overall mental health definitely improved when I met my husband. I mean, a lot of it has to do with the fact he’s not a piece of shit like my exes were, but we also have a deeper understanding of each other that I never had with my white boyfriends. 

I didn’t grow up around many Asian guys, and it felt borderline incestuous to date the ones I did know since I essentially grew up with them. I met my husband in college, and he’s the first Asian man I’ve had a serious relationship with. It feels so good to be with someone who just “got” me in a fundamental way deeper than attraction/chemistry/compatibility. I also don’t feel like an object or a curiosity anymore; when I dated white guys, I felt like I was being paraded around."
22,soge80,"I'm from Idaho so my main options were white people. I used to think that I could only really settle for a white person. A few people I dated had serious Asian fetishes. I thought that I didn't have a choice in that matter. They never took me seriously. Some were abusive. One time a boyfriend's dad said something racist to me and he then proceeded to gaslight me by saying that his dad wasn't racist, I was just crazy. I found that usually they downplayed their parent's casual racism by a lot. Some were somewhat racist themselves. A woman I dated was casually racist. I think she only wanted to date me to say that she couldn't be racist because she was dating an asian. They were clueless about a lot of things. There's a huge cultural gap. I found that the white people I've dated never accommodate me but always expect me to accommodate them when it come to cultural differences. They never understood what it was like to be an asian american woman. I had toxic thoughts that I could never be with an asian person because I was traumatized by my parents but then I dated an asian man. It was brief but it was really nice. He understood what it was like to have difficult parents. He knew what it was like to be an asian american in a rural part of America. He had only been with white people like I had before we met. He also knew what it was like to be the only Asian in the room. It was a really awesome relationship. We're just friends now but it's great to have someone that understands. I made a joke that I was one step closer to getting an arranged marriage. My white friends did not find it funny but he understood the humor in it. I support you. Ali Wong was right, asian men are underrated and they are awesome partners."
23,soge80,"Nope not weird at all, was the same way with white women in my early young adult years growing up in the midwest. 

And then meeting my asian partner made it all the more worth it. 

Sounds like you know the answer already and good luck on your journey!"
24,soge80,"Honestly nothing against anyone. But I have never dated a white person but the thought of dating one makes me really super Insecure and uncomfortable. I feel like they will never get me or my culture or that I will be judged. On the other hand dating any immigrant or person of some other ethnicity sounds more welcoming because i feel like people won’t judge you culturally. As a south Asian, I honestly also hate it when white men makes statements that  south Asian women are “exotic” like we belong to some species of flora and fauna."
25,soge80,"As an Asian man who felt constantly rejected by my own fellow Asian Americans, being told ""I don't don't Asian men"" this means the world to me. In my opinion we need more people like you. Thank you!!!!!!!!!"
26,soge80,"Nah I getcha. I'm a lesbian so the dating pools too small to be too selective but I definitely have a preference for other mixed Asian Americans or at least other POC even if white women aren't as bad in my experience. I don't ""look"" Asian, more like a light skinned middle eastern woman. To be honest I've always felt bad about my preference. Like I'm somehow dismissing white people despite being half white myself and like I'm willing to date white people, there aren't exactly many options when your dating pool is so small. but the small stuff is exausting. I don't deal with racism."
27,soge80,"I love this thread as an asian man. this gives me hope. dating has been tough for me. really twisted view of myself. went through the classic trying to be white phase. Now i’m in my proud asian phase. so thank you. 

i too have decided to stop dating white women. i love being able to talk to Poc about Poc experience."
28,soge80,"Take a listen to Invisibilia's episode called [""A Very Offensive Rom-Com""](https://www.npr.org/2019/04/04/709948132/a-very-offensive-rom-com) where they talk about racial preferences in dating. It's pretty interesting. Not the exact same situation as yours, but still something to think about."
29,soge80,Glad you woke up from the Anti-Asian men propaganda that has developed ever since Asian men started coming here.
30,soge80,"There is nothing inherently wrong with interracial relationships but somehow I'd say a lot of them are weird and problematic.

I very distinctly remember that my friend's mom (Korean) would go out to eat Asian food and then come back home to cook her husband(white) western dinner because he vocally expressed his dislike for Asian food and always complained about the smell so he wouldn't let her cook Korean food in the house."
31,soge80,"I'm starting to feel like it'll be hard for me to date another white men. Some of them like to show off their ""wokeness"" in dates. But how tone deaf can you be telling me that capitalism is evil and how it just makes the disparity of rich and poor greater over expensive drinks and a charcuterie board at a speakeasy? Like EYE ROLL give me a break White privilege/ignorance much?"
32,soge80,">I just discarded like 90% of the us population with a hard no.

Seems like your view is still distorted (not your fault) by what the media has told you. The U.S. in 2022 is only 75% white, and that percentage is much lower in large diverse cities, closer to 50%."
33,soge80,"It’s ok, it’s not odd to prefer someone who can relate better to you. I always find it sad no other race would think it’s weird or something to be made fun of (to date the same race) except us Asians… I guess that’s what the media does :(

Personally I prefer Asian men and am dating one, idc anymore (I used to tho so I get it) if ppl joke about it. A nice perk is that I get Asian desserts especially mooncake day from his mom a lot of the time ;)"
34,soge80,"GURRRLLLL STOP JUDGING YOURSELF PLZZ!!!!!!


My experience of dating white men was disgusting but i was in so much denial about my discomfort with them. The way they treated me ranged all the different examples of being fetishized (dating an east asian woman, dating an alt east asian woman with tatts and piercings, dating a light skinned WOC to seem woke, dating a WOC to learn more about the pain of my community). My denial came from childhood trauma and me gaslighting myself that i was being too judgmental when i noticed red flags. I didnt want to treat ppl the way my mom treated me, so i applied my denial as me checking myself from acting like my mom. 

Therapy taught me how warped my way of unlearning was and how to trust my instincts and how to differentiate anxiety from intuition. 

Im truly happy for you and the decisions youve made to trust yourself <3"
35,soge80,No it's not weird. I stopped dating them too
36,soge80,"Congrats on finding what works best for you! 

Once you get past any pre-conceived bs you grew up with, you find what works best for you."
37,soge80,"*Surprise, surprise:* Asian men have been getting more clout and attention now than they ever since more Asian men have been positively featured in media.

TFW the elevated status of white men was just marketing and exclusion.

Guarantee you it’s only going up from here with a new gen of media savvy Asian creators."
38,soge80,"I’ll die alone before being romantically involved with a white man.

Glad for you to join the movement!"
39,soge80,"I would love to date more Asian men, but most can't see past my weight. But I do sympathize with not dating white men. I have my apps set to anything but white. This is a small concession but effective."
40,soge80,"I see a lot of people here conflating interracial relationships with relationships with a white partner, specifically men. Must be a defense mechanism. It is very different. White men don't have to face racism, nor do they face misogyny. They aren't discriminated against for their race or gender. Compared to an interracial relationship with any other poc or with another asian or asian american, it is VASTLY different."
41,soge80,"I would slap high school me with how infatuated I was with the idea of having a white boyfriend/girlfriend. Thankfully the ones I dated in college weren't the icky fetish types and never even hinted at having feelings of the sort, even during sex.

I've encountered more of those icky types in my adult life with the rise of apps, which has definitely turned me off most men who seem to think telling me they've never been or dated  an Asian girl before is a sort of compliment. Thanks, I guess I'm the lucky one. Not. 

Glad your image of Asian men have changed though, I never thought they weren't hot (Won Bin hngggg) and I'm also glad they're (very recently) receiving more of the spot light in entertainment."
42,soge80,"hey, so the feeling that  ""something was missing,"" as you put it,  when you were dating white men is not just in your head. That je ne sais quoi is real.

We are hardwired to be most attracted to our own tribe, it is the evolutionary drive to pass down our own traits to the next generation to ensure its continuation (this is not to say we can't be attracted to others, I am saying *most attracted,*  in an ideal scenario).  Only, with humans, this evolutionary drive can be overridden by external influences. The global appeal of white men, and the hypersexualization of asian women has been artificially generated by mainstream media in the former, and by adult (pRon) media in the latter.

From my own experience, I went through a period of literally dating every race in my younger years. I've had good relationships and amazing snu snu with all of them- but with asian women, there was definitely that extra connection going on. And the sex- it was like extra, extra carnal, like my body knew it wanted to pass on them genes or something.  I exclusively date asian women now (probably subconsciously because I am ready to start a family, settle down, the whole nine)."
43,soge80,"Good on you. As an Asian man I dated both white women and Asian women (married one), and here's the thing that stood out to me - white women dating Asian men could care less about other white and non white women, while my female Asian friends dating white men always seemed to look down on or invalidate non white men. 

It's rooted in insecurity imo. Also a reflection of the dynamics of how Asian culture seemed to be in a Renaissance moment since the turn of this century."
44,soge80,"I don't think it's weird. I'm Chinese and I grew up in an all white family and community. Growing up I use to like white boys, but as I've gotten older I've come to a point that I'll only date Asian men. For me it's about being with someone who has the ability to experience the same experiences as me and relate with me on a deeper level and not just sympathize with me. Also being able to have someone by my side who looks like me is also somewhat comforting. I hope I'm not the only one who feels this way? But I don't think it's weird at all!"
45,soge80,Like who you want! Us Asian American guys are cool too! I can seriously relate to you and I’m hoping you find peace with yourself. I am still struggling myself so best of luck. Feel free to dm me
46,soge80,be proud of yourself and your culture :)
47,soge80,"Not weird at all to not date white men, I’ve never dated a white person bc of the experiences I’ve had with white peers - like why would I want to create the dynamic I experienced in a romantic relationship? However, I am curious as to why you are only interested in Asian men? 

I’ve noticed though that white people, especially men, are absolutely *gobsmacked* by my preference for BIPOC in romantic relationships. It makes me laugh though that a lot of white people (at least here in the US/where I live) have never dated a person of color, but for some reason expect me to want to date them? 

I think they’re used to being the “default” especially with the media’s portrayal of interracial relationships (they mostly show couples who are white/ethnic instead of 2 POC from different races). I respect individuals who are willing to share what it’s like being part of a marginalized racial community and want to teach their white partner about it, but I’m not interested at all in being someone’s teacher (or their family’s teacher)."
48,soge80,I've come to this same exact conclusion!! I'm sooo done with white guys it's not even funny.
49,soge80,"THE SAME EXACT THING HAPPENED TO MEEE. I got into kpop and realized ??? Where are these men represented in the media? Now that being said, I know idols and k actors are the “ideal” and like they’re all super hot & all that. But? I grew up seeing Asian men in western media as either nerdy, weird, super smart (viewed negatively) or just plain dumb. Being half Asian myself I wanted to be white SOOO bad & “fit in” so I only was interested in white dudes. 

Flash forward to now, I embrace my Asian side (Filipino) and other Asian cultures & recognize the culture richness and am leaning into the Asian foods/cooking/media that I grew up with but ignored (or tried to ignore) for so long. I now am only attracted to Asian men & will literally never touch a white (American) man again. This isn’t racial, I just embraced my culture and realized I need someone raised in the same or similar environment/culture dynamic/values and mindsets that I was raised in to truly feel connected to someone. And let’s not even talk about my white exes disrespect to Asian culture and people in GENERAL that I used to either JOIN (????!!?) or brush off.. it’s not just about preference at this point for me, it’s about who I am as an Asian American. Periodt. Rant over LOL"
50,soge80,"I used to date white boys as a high schooler- in my early college days. Once I hit like 22 I just naturally wanted to date other Asian Americans and have only dated them since. It’s not that I consciously told myself ‘no white men’, but I naturally gravitated towards other Asians."
51,soge80,i was obsessing with white ppl too but now i dont care for them. seeing as u went through a similar thing can u explain to me why this is a thing? it really fucked up my earlier life
52,soge80,"I can relate to a degree. I also did this. I dated a white American once… never again. It was long term. I was never attracted to Asian men or hapa men. My friend kept suggesting to give it a try just once and oh. My. God. 

I can’t believe I was holding myself back for so long. I started talking to guys across various Asian ethnicities and I was feeling a connection I’ve never felt before! 

Having the general cultural connection over upbringing, identity, and interests brought me so much comfort… and now I don’t think I can ever go back. 

My attraction started off as emotional and now it has bled into physical. Culture is important to me and if I have kids it feels good to know my kids will have a culture from both sides rather than just me"
53,soge80,"I don't think it's wrong to have a preference and be pragmatic about wanting someone who more easily understands you. I think it's possible you may miss someone you're really compatible with, as no race is a monolith. I agree in that I would prefer to date an Asian guy, but I wouldn't automatically shut out non-Asians."
54,soge80,[deleted]
55,soge80,Well at least you found that your previous tastes in white men came from an unhealthy place. Hopefully you are able to open up your options and have a better sense of judgement when it comes to seeking out a healthy relationship with someone else (regardless of the race of your potential partner).
56,soge80,"I'm in the same boat but with regards tk white women. I'm tired of being put on a pedestal or fetishized for being Asian. No, I'm not a k-pop stan, I'm not even Korean. I don't like how white women who date Asian men would say nasty things about Asian women. And if you're not comfortable with your kid knowing/speaking a ""foreign"" language, you can go fuck yourself."
57,soge80,"I think there can be a lot of really good things about dating within our culture because understanding comes more easily. I’ve dated one white guy and one Asian. Even though my Asian ex and I were not the same ethnicity, we had mutual attitudes of respect towards our parents, etc. My white boyfriend initially had difficulties with the song and dance of how to negotiate with Asian parents."
58,soge80,"I mean it's good that you've realized that you had an unhealthy relationship with white men in the past, perhaps bordering on fetishization.

But going hard the other way seems to be overcompensating. Asian men aren't a monolith either, plenty of great attractive ones and plenty of asshole ugly on the insides ones. You can find love anywhere. Why not focus on actually finding a man that you enjoy being around who respects you, no matter what race?"
59,soge80,"I think you should take some time off dating and figure yourself out a bit. Instead of writing off men - do some soul searching and tap into your roots. Study the roots of your people, the food, the traditions, the language and embrace them. I find White people with ""yellow fever"" annoying as hell. And that includes White women koreaboos who thirst over kpop stars. That being said, I do think its possible to have a strong interracial relationship. I've seen them. But what I noticed that in those healthy relationships, the POC in the relationship (male or female) were very proud of their heritage. Love yourself and where you came from first, once you do that you'll be able to weed out the fetishists and find attract a  partner who respects you for who you are regardless of skin color."
60,soge80,"Not only normal, but very positive! I think with better representation this will become much more common."
61,soge80,"Huh. The thread hasn't been locked yet. This is always a touchy topic. When you say ""toxic"", do you mean like this one woman of Japanese descent who, awhile back, practically wrote a mini-dissertation on why she would never date Asian men, listing the ""deficiencies"" (all playing into media stereotypes), and why, after she married some tall White guy, she intended to move to Japan with him, almost as a way of returning as triumphant from the diaspora? In terms of race, I, personally, don't see the problem with people dating whomever they want; however, I do have a bit of a problem with aggressively advocating some way or another."
62,soge80,"It's nice to recognize but don't go from one exclusion to another. We are all people of varying cultures, backgrounds, and upbringing. Just don't fall for media propagandas."
63,soge80,[removed]
64,soge80,"Ive mostly dated Asian guys over the years with other races scattered in, and am now in a serious relationship with a white guy. When I first started dating my boyfriend I spent so much time in therapy because I felt like a race traitor. The head games involved with dating as an Asian American sucks, for both men and women in different ways. As I’ve gotten older, I have now learned to prioritize men who respect me, my culture, and my career, regardless of what race they are. And finally, YOU are the person who knows and has the capacity to love yourself the most. May you get peace and love."
65,soge80,"As a half asian, why don't you just not care about who you date? Love can come from anyone. I mean there are people who like dating within their race and thats fine but seems like you are fixating on weird things. You sound like you are trying way too hard to sound woke. Date who you want it's really that simple."
66,soge80,Nope care for yourself and surround yourself with who you think is best for yourself
67,soge80,I guess it's like being an alcoholic. When you first stop drinking you gotta stop 100%. It's only years later when you have it under control that you can occasionally drink at Xmas and things.
68,soge80,"Any specific nationality of Asian?

I understand the desire for your significant other to understand the prejudices and difficulties you are facing, too."
69,soge80,"Eh. I think it is bad to only date certain races. If that is how you operate, so be it but personally I don't think it is a good idea."
70,soge80,How about black and brown? Or brown Asian?
71,soge80,[deleted]
72,soge80,"I wouldn't say it's weird but I would say it's wrong-ish mindset. And I'll later mention why the ""ish"". I mean the good part is that you are making an effort to stop obsessing with white people. But I don't think it makes sense to go the full 180 and say only asian men. What about other races or white men who aren't toxic? I think instead of focusing on the race (unless you actually aren't physically attracted to the race), focus on the person.

As for the ""ish"". I can't say because I don't know you. While I don't agree with discarding all white men. Maybe because of your past experiences, it is just too hard to be with a white man anymore. And if that is the case, then that is okay, your mental health is important. But unless you aren't physically attracted to other races as well, I wouldn't just limit yourself to Asian men. I would just exclude white men but be open to any other race asian, black, latino, etc."
73,soge80,"This seems bizarre to me.  How about judging each person as an individual and making your choice based on that?  I also find it totally insane how people in this thread refer to ""Asian people"" as a monolith when anyone who has lived in Asia knows exactly how different a person from Japan is than a person from Myanmar....or even a person from Osaka vs Tokyo."
74,soge80,Not trying to be too far off topic but is your therapist Asian or white ?
75,soge80,"A little confused on the difference between ""white"" men and ""Asian"" men.  Also American Asian values versus country of origin Asian values.  And American Asian first, second or third generation values.

But do what makes you feel good."
76,soge80,"I'd say don't pigeon hole yourself into any one category. Be open to dating any race at any time. not all white men are the same, and not are all Asian men are either. Otherwise you might be swinging from extremes and missing out.

As an Asian male who's working through my own depression and issues and had a really hard time finding a partner and been frustrated over how so many Asian females (and most of the world) only want to excusively date white men, it's kinda interesting to see this.

But I also understand for myself that ultimately, due to 500 years of history and white colonial dominance, white has, and continues, and will continue to (in the near foreseeable future) rule the world. And so I understand that if I was an Asian female, I'd want to date the white man also. It's maybe better for the genes and offspring I guess. It's evolutionary, and maybe subconscious.

Thanks for sharing and best of luck on your journey. And all our journeys. May we find joy and peace."
77,soge80,Or maybe don’t date people based on race but by the individual content of their character 🤷🏻‍♂️

I'm on the fence about ""race shouldn't matter"" because it does in context. I grew up in a Black and Asian community (mostly attracted to them) but my attraction change after I went to a PWI college. It wasn't until I did some reflection on myself and the toxicity I subconsciously carried, not was I able to bring appreciate my own cultural identity but challenge my own biases on race. The challenges are there: cultures, languages, traditions, and racial struggles. I'm not saying it won't work but the challenges will be in your face. I'm a interracial marriage and we have our challenges, but our values has help us get through some of these barriers. Dating your own ethnicity can be easier but has its own challenge: patriarchal society which is usually around the gender roles (but not always)."

Classic deflecting and normalization of anti-Asian racism 😍"
2,studfj,"I've seen posts make it to the front page of reddit dismissing this! Hell, I've seen non-asians in this very subreddit do the same. They really don't think that there's a problem. I've experienced this sentiment, long before the current climate. I would talk to my friends about what it's like to be seen as a perpetual foreigner. As an acceptable target of ridicule. And they would all just kinda have this blank look on their face that's telling me everything I'm saying is going in one ear and out the other. sigh"
3,studfj,"Those who say that want to see these all as individual acts of violence - and that the attacker could have attacked anyone. But the fact that Asians experiencing higher rates of violence/oppression than in previous years makes this less about individual attacks, it's about the experience of Asian-Americans as a whole. 

When you start to argue that Asian-Americans are facing higher levels of oppression recently: high rates of violence, exploitation, powerlessness, marginalization, domination, people don't want to confront their society's own prejudice towards Asians. 

Perhaps the intent for this individual attack wasn't pre-planned or there is no proof his previous prejudice against Asians, but this adds to the growing rate of violence against the Asian community in this time period short time period. And it's rise of violent attacks overall that is telling and we have to act now."
4,studfj,"We can't win here with either side. On one side we have the right dominated by openly racists xenophobes  who are only fine with Asians as long we let the likes of that orange fucker do the thinking for us. 

&#x200B;

On the left we have a bunch of progressives and liberals who are all too content to ignore racism against Asians because apparently we all come from a background of privilege filled with piano lessons and Ivy League admissions never mind the huge class divide among Asian Americans in general. The yellow peril mindset in this country never went away, it was just forced to be a little more subtle."

7,studfj,"> “was it really an anti Asian hate crime or a result of lack of mental health resources, housing crisis, neglect of the homeless etc”.

It's both. It's a toxic mix of hate combined with all of these institutional failures.

Edit: 
I say this because if you compare US to a country like Australia, where Sky News and other Murdoch-owned media channels regularly drum-up anti-China sentiments (Aus is also notorious for its racism), the violence is not happening at the same levels, despite ~15% of Australia being Asian-descent. 

Obviously, it's not to say that it doesn't happen in Australia because it absolutely happens there, too, and I have no doubts that Asian-Australians have been threatened or spatted on. But the sheer level of violence and killings is not quite on par with what we see in places like NYC or SF, and I cannot help but wonder it's because of institutional railguards in place."
8,studfj,"Oh yah, it's a form of racism through erasure."
9,studfj,It's fair enough to bemoan the conditions in our society that lead to tragic crimes. But one of those conditions IS the racism against Asians. People who claim otherwise are just fooling themselves.
10,studfj,"And I don’t understand that when black men were shot (by civilians, not by police), no one said “is it really a targeted attack or is it a problem with crime and education and mental health issues etc.” I support stopping hate on Black/African American population but it seems no one really cares about us when we are attacked."
11,studfj,"I feel you - it has been very exhausting

And the left and the right talk about these hate crimes not to solve them, but to blame the other side and virtue signal"
12,studfj,"Gaslighting is the perfect way to describe this whole situation. At worst some even have the audacity to victim blame, saying Asians “deserve it” or should be “held accountable for their privilege.”"

I mean it's happened to me even if I can't definitively prove it's because I'm Asian. Hell the cops once walked in on my (white) mother beating me with a wooden stool head bleeding, they took me aside and told me to be more obedient and threatened to charge me with assault next time.

And what about mental health?""

Does it fucking matter? All of those ""questions"" are focused on bringing attention to the perpetrators and diminishing the attacks on our people. The fact is Michelle Go was murderd. Christine Lee was brutally murdered. They'll never be able to live out the rest of their lives, and they've become two more in the long and increasing string of attacks and murders of members of our community."
18,studfj,"""Astounding lack of empathy  to debate semantics"" absolutely hit it on the nose.

I commented on a TikTok about Michelle Go’s death and I said how what happened to her is one of many reasons I don’t think my mom would be safe in traveling to New York, and someone who was being ignorant and color blind said something like “you’re more likely to die inside a subway rather than being pushed off it, but okay”, and this pissed me off as he was treating this as though it was just an example of how someone can die rather than how it affects the Asian community as many Asian-Americans fear for their safety even more when these things happen."

They all see this as just a weird proxy for whatever culture war is their current #1 priority, not a problem that actually results in people being hurt or dying."
24,studfj,"Why not both? People look for simple answers to complex situations. 

Personally, I don't consider it a hate crime in the traditional sense of neo-nazis going out and beating up minorities. But I do think race plays a role in violence against asian women just like race played a role in Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery. It just plays out in different ways.

The murderer is clearly mental. I don't go down the route of ""need more mental health resources"" because, frankly, I don't think that works. It's not like many of these people are looking for help and can't find it. Most choose to be there due to addiction. We let these people roam the streets and reactively address the situation after someone's been killed. That's on us (as a society). I'm sympathetic in that there are no easy answers but more shelters, more social workers and more cheap housing will not fix a situation where people choose to be on the street and live through addiction.

In my opinion, what's more disappointing than it being an asian hate crime (or not), is the response by society, media and political leaders. Media will sell page clicks for a day. Society will say it's a homeless problem. Political leaders will cry from the bully pulpit only to do nothing about it. 

What I and many asians feel is that if this were a white woman, things would be much different. Media would create a narrative around white women being targeted. Society will say that this has to stop and white women should be able to walk safely at night and not be murdered. Other whites would pay more attention and rally to the cause. Political leaders would actually enact changes to law and policing to make a difference. 

This is my real problem with the situation because this is what actually leads to change."

I feel that too many within Asian communities are indulging on hating each other. It's like the GOT's Theon being turned into a pet and betraying their own people due to fear and discrimination flashbacks.

And I do think there's a even deeper root to this. I remember when I was young, my parents always tells me things like ""this areas full of (put any Asian community here), they made the env so dirty and try to avoid them when you out."" Not sure where the idea of describing Asians like this were from, but I think the not so subtle hint/effect/linkage between negativity amongst Asians were deeply planted. It's going to take awhile for those among us to change naturally. Or it will take some really dramatic events for them to be awoken shockingly."

2,mrl151,"This reminds me of the death of a Chinese American in Detroit in 1982. The Japanese had introduced cheap cars with great gas mileage and the gas guzzling American automotive industry was on the ropes. Two automotive employees saw the Asian, assumed that he was Japanese, and killed him. They were charged with 2nd degree murder which they pled down to manslaughter. They got 3 years of probation and had to pay a $3000 fine."
3,mrl151,Absolutely fucked up
4,mrl151,"That poor woman. Despite all this, people are still trying to downplay these attacks are racially motivated which is an expected behavior from right-wingers. There’s a some left-leaning posters who deny the racial aspects of this as well. There’s a number of those on rBayArea subs."
5,mrl151,"The fact that a person is beating up another person for any reason is sad.

On top of this, the fact that these racists are targeting elderly Asian people is just disgusting. They are so weak that they have to pray on grandmas and grandpas to feel good about themselves. This just lets you know that they are self aware of their racism and are huge cowards."
6,mrl151,"This happened in my hood not too far from my house. The population here is a mix of affluent bourgeois hipster families and middle class Filipino and Latino families. Overall pretty diverse. Despite this attack, I still feel safe in my neighborhood. But it sure hurts knowing that this attack happened to one of our community members and so close to home."
7,mrl151,"Proof nonwhite people of all backgrounds should support each other, racists are too dumb to tell us apart

Then it gradually moved towards its logical target, “Asians” (rising/risen economic competition, large non-white populations, small representation in the US, etc). This hurricane has now stalled over Asians and doesn’t look to move anytime soon.  Unfortunately, as Americans that come from various Asian heritages, we are not much of a unified group and in the current environment, we don’t have much support or allies from other minority groups.

First rule of Bruce’s fight club was don’t fight — unless there is no other option. He felt no need to prove himself.

1,pidogx,"Listen here Asian men. You are masculine. Truly the epitome of masculinity. Despite colonization and imperialism, you have managed to preserve many of our ancestral cultures in the mainland. A lot of our history is still intact despite brutal colonization. You’ve built ancient civilizations and now you’re rebuilding the continent once again and doing it successfully. East Asia is thriving and SouthEast Asia and South are projected to soon follow. Asian men are literally a threat to white supremacy. 

You’re one of the most educated groups. Your children outperform in higher education in large numbers. You raise your children and never leave them in broken homes. 

No this isn’t me putting Asian men on a pedestal. Masculinity isn’t just how big a man can be physically. It’s how he builds the family and the community which Asian men, as a collective, have done tremendously well objectively. 

I know y’all don’t hear this enough from us Asian women but y’all are very much appreciated. We see y’all constantly fight for the community.

My 2 cents, is machismo among AA men isn't just incels. It's seemingly well adjusted AA men & women that still believe an Asian son is supreme leader of the family legacy . 

That's not to say my brothers out there don't endure struggle, but I hope there comes a day when there can be honest conversation about how AA women have to endure the entitlement, insecurities, repressed emotions, & sometimes violence of toxic masculinity from Asian sons. If AA women can't cater to it like our mamas did, we are sexualized, dismissed,  labeled as white lovers (even if we've never dated them) 

Keeping a family together doesn't mean shit if you treat your daughters different than your sons. And antidotally, I always faced more blatant judgment from Asian men than any other group bc of how outspoken I am. But I would NEVER condemn all Asian men bc they aren't all the same person? So just bc some Asian women may be mean to men, not all Asian women should be judged just bc they may not like YOU. No one should accept toxic behavior just bc they understand how it came to be

>As attacks on AAPIs have spiked over the last 12 months, the calls for help and the warning signs from our community have felt ignored—as if the stories were about people living on the other side of the world, not about your neighbors in America.

>As “perpetual foreigners” and subjects of the model minority myth, Asians are invited but not fully integrated, or just largely ignored under the guise of being “O.K.” in culture and politics. As AAPIs we have been excluded, interned, vilified, emasculated, fetishized and murdered.

>For some time, I thought that this uncomfortable position we are in was our own doing. We wanted to be seen as American. We wanted to be accepted and celebrated just like everyone else. We wanted to fit in.

>A submission to, and eventual complicity with racism normalized a dynamic that should not exist. To grow up believing we needed to be O.K. with racism in order to have a seat at the table is not O.K..To internalize racism at such a young age, in retrospect, warped my sense of normality. As a victim of a hit-and-run incident as a young teenager, I actually questioned if my mom was in the wrong when the driver got out of his car, slammed his fists on our window and screamed at my mother, “You dumbass motherf-cking ch-nk!” I’m Korean, by the way. 

>To suggest the murders of Daoyou Feng (44), Delaina Ashley Yaun Gonzalez (33), Suncha Kim (69), Hyun Jung Grant (51), Soon C. Park (74), Xiaojie Tan (49), Paul Andre Michels (54) and Yong A. Yue (63) were not racially motivated is completely naive and racist in itself. To dehumanize the lives of eight individuals because someone was, as the sheriff’s department spokesman put it, “having a bad day” or to blame their actions on “sex addiction” is the height of white privilege and reveals the depth of the over-sexualization—and objectification—of an entire race’s gender. Why are women of our community the outlet for and victims of your sexual addiction? How dare you.

>Several still ask, “Why haven’t you said anything?” Let’s be very clear: we have always been pleading for your help, perhaps more than ever over the past year. You did not listen. You did not hear us. Please hear us now because being silent now is being complicit.

1,m8t7ls,"My sister was born in Atlanta, Georgia. I spent my junior year in high school there. It was the worst experience ever.

I was one of three minorities at what was otherwise an all white school. One of the other minorities was from India. The third minority was black. The white kids said that the black kid was okay because he was on the football team. The white boys drooled over the Indian girl and gave her a ""pass"" because she was ""hot"". I was told that I was okay for a g--k because I talked white. 

At the first and only football game I attended, we played against an inner city school of largely black students. Some white kids stood at the top of the bleachers on our side of the field and waved the Stars and Bars. ""THE SOUTH WILL RISE AGAIN!"" they shouted. None of the white teachers, school administrators, or coaches (from either side of the field) said or did anything.

I remember when the librarian asked me to deliver a film to a 9th grade class.

""CH--k! CH--k! CH--k!"" shouted the class. The white teacher said and did nothing.

A few weeks later, some white kids thought that they needed to teach me a lesson. They ganged up on me in a stairwell and left me bleeding on the floor.

""Boys will be boys,"" explained the principal to my father. Nothing ever happened to these kids.

6,m8t7ls,"Great article but I wish they spoke to more people and talked about the largely ignored violent hate crime that has been going on long before COVID, how violence rose during SARs, and how model minority perpetuated resentment among other individuals who have attacked elderly prior to COVID. Trump absolutely did not help and is part of the problem but a lot of people here are trying to make him the de facto cause of these violence. People who believe this and scapegoat Trump are also complicit in the racism then. They are trying to bury it under the rug. The whole country needs to start taking accountability for this. They haven't been listening; and many have listened but willfully ignored it while gaslighting Asians. Asians have been booed out in settings of safe circles trying to talk about racism. People like Mark Wahlberg talks about BLM but stays quiet about violence towards Asians while also having a past conviction of hate crime violence leaving an Asian victim handicapped. That's pretty much how it feels like Americans are treating racism towards Asians."

0,n00dku,"I live north of Seattle in the Mill Creek-area, but have a lot of history in the Bothell-area, and reading about this shook me to my core.

Silly me, here I thought the suburbs would be safer when it comes to this and not fearing for my safety as an Asian-American with the rise of hate crimes against Asian-Americans. I mean for fucks sake, I used to live in Bothell, went to HS in Kenmore, and much like the rest of the Eastside there is a well-established Asian-American community there (even if not as high as in Bellevue or Kirkland) and also lack of crime compared to Seattle which is where I expected more of shit like this to happen and made sure to be more safe around.

Fuck everything about this."
1,n00dku,"I hope this is ok to post here in hopes of getting John's wife Rumeet any help possible right now. I'm a friend of John's and he was so good. We're all heart broken right now and I can't even imagine Rumeet's pain. Of course nothing is expected but if anybody at all is wanting to help here is a Go Fund Me set up for his wife, they married only a few months ago.

I don't know if Reddit will allow me to link here unfortunately but you can just search In the Loving Memory of John Huynh.

 [https://www.gofundme.com/f/in-the-loving-memory-of-john-huynh?utm\_campaign=p\_cp\_url&utm\_medium=os&utm\_source=customer](https://www.gofundme.com/f/in-the-loving-memory-of-john-huynh?utm_campaign=p_cp_url&utm_medium=os&utm_source=customer) 

I don't have all the details but what I do know is this was completely unprovoked and there was no altercation nor did they know one another. They had just come home and the suspect was outside and it occurred right in front of Rumeet. I don't think there's going to be any good answers here, it's just sad.

Thanks for anything anyone can do to help, even if it's just sharing with others or passing along messages of comfort. John was as good a man as I've found on this earth and we'll miss him so much."

>According to police documents, Huynh was leaving a Bothell apartment along with several people, including his wife, while Williams — who lived in the apartment building — was standing outside near the door.

>Witnesses told Bothell police that Williams immediately “gave the middle finger” to Huynh, who was leaving the building.

>Witnesses told police that Huynh then asked Williams if he “flipped him off or waved at him.” A witness told police seconds later, he saw “Williams pull out a knife and stab the victim in the heart.”

It blows my mind that someone could fly into a murderous rage over nothing like this, all Huynh did was ask if the murderer was flipping him off (which he was!). Huynh's poor wife watched as her husband was murdered in front of her and there was nothing she could do."
16,n00dku,Was it crime or a hate crime?
17,n00dku,"Something to keep mind.

While it is **very possible the attack was a motivated by bigotry,** it might not have been.

It is important to not make assumptions about the cause until the facts are available.

There is a follow-up story that reports that the rational given by the killer has nothing to do with the victim's ethnicity.

1,ftt56l,This shouldn't be our problem to fix. America has a culture of finding someone to blame and being OK with just scapegoating and not doing anything productive about it. I mean every country has this but Americans do it harder.
2,ftt56l,"Word, we must rise when we are oppressed. I always stood down and kept my head down when bullied, but never again. Realized from personal experience that cops or authorities don’t really give a shit either. Got to stand up for my self now."
3,ftt56l,"The existence of Asian Americans is valid in itself. Nothing is needed in order to prove anything.

You exist, you're valid, and you're American.

If you see racism, call it out, that's it. Plain and simple."
4,ftt56l,"After 9/11, Muslim-Americans were told the same thing by their imams and community leaders. That if they kept their heads down and tried to be ""more American"", the discrimination and racism will end.

Given the rise of Islamophobia in the succeeding years, that obviously didn't work. Trying to appease racists will *always* be a losing strategy, so don't do it."
5,ftt56l,"Well that's a big disappointment. Not that I supported him but I always think he ran a pretty decent campaign, always think it‘s good to see Asians in politics. 

Keeping our heads down won't work, Americanness won't help, even if you glue your passport on your forehead you will still be told to “go back to your country“. Being a sheep will just end up being slaughtered."
6,ftt56l,"If we lived in a completely civilized society, maybe Andrew Yangs method would work, but the problem is we don’t. These racists are the dregs of society and 12 years+ of compulsory education have had no effect in shaping them to become civilized human beings. Their hate is visceral and viral and they need to be shown that it will not be tolerated. They need to be stood up to, shamed and re-educated. Asians may not be comfortable with the confrontation but they need to learn how to effectively fight back individually as well as in groups to create effective change."
7,ftt56l,"Agreed, I think we as a community have licked enough boots. I'm tired of the taste of leather."
8,ftt56l,"The idea that Asian Americans (and those of Asian decent overall) need to take responsibility over the racism and xenophobia produced globally is not only outrageous, but is part of the larger structure of racial capitalism. Where capitalism is based on individualism and how the market (and now behavior) are transactional. We see corporation marketing to a progress audience and then theses mass turn around to expect and demand those being attached/discriminated themselves to “put in some work” to not be the recipients of said hate. 

And let’s not forget all the respectively politics that flips the narratives onto black/brown/disable/undoc/trans people. None of these people should have to “step up” or alter their behaviors."
9,ftt56l,"**I would like to see a well-worded, follow up statement from Yang.** There's a pattern I'm seeing that might be a cause of the divide: 

**1) people who are seeing past his literal words and believing it was well intentioned**   
**2) people who took his words literally**

I take most things very literally so this article still irritates me, but I think it's possible things were misunderstood.   
(Ideally, I would like for him to go line by line and explain what he meant, but that's not going to happen lol) 

Just remember we all want the same thing: no racism."
10,ftt56l,I’ve defended Yang for a while because I felt that it was important to push the idea of UBI into the mainstream. But this dude has absolutely terrible opinions when it comes to speaking on behalf of Asian Americans.
11,ftt56l,"Is he Mike Masaoka, reincarnated? 

(Mike Masaoka, from the JACL, told Japanese Americans to go into Japanese Internment Camps to show patriotism)."
12,ftt56l,"These are White issues, not Asian issues. It's tiring for PoC to constantly remind Whites the issue at hand. There isn't anything to be done by PoC. They need to change their mindset, accept that when you say Americans, you are including everyone else. Stop looking at us like we are foreigners and have to explain where we were born.

If you want to not be racist, stop being racist. When you see something happen in front of you, don't be a bystander. Call it out. That's the only way behavior will change in the right direction over time. Otherwise ducking your head and acting like it isn't your problem, is the problem. You become the problem.

I'm tired of explaining this shit for them."
13,ftt56l,"When we were thrown into camps some felt that it was their patriotic duty. That this is how they could help the war effort  (it was not). Some left camps and went to fight in the war (442nd Infantry Regiment) it was their patriotic duty.   Others organized protests and wrote op-ed's in the camp papers. Still, others sued the government when they were released (see Oyama v California) Asian Americans are not a monolith. Individual Asian communities are not a monolith. We are however all American and have a responsibility to call out all forms of injustice not just for having been subject to it for so long but because we are American."
14,ftt56l,"I feel like a lot of AAs from that generation are taught to uphold the model minority myth, despite the obvious flaws in it. My parents are the same, pretty sure I would be too if I hadn’t met the people I have. I definitely don’t agree with Andrew on the things he says that perpetuate the myth, but I kind of understand why he would say them, if that makes sense?"
15,ftt56l,I agree with Jeff but the Twitter comments are blowing this out of proportion.
16,ftt56l,"On one hand I agree that you shouldn’t have to do anything to prove you’re American or avoid racist attacks. On the other, so you do nothing, your community does nothing, what does that solve and how does it help prevent further attacks? So instead be part of the solution (as all Americans should be).

What’s the ideal alternative here?"
17,ftt56l,"I appreciated Yang as a candidate in so far as an Asian-American was a major candidate. 

But he’s pretty shitty at representing Asian-Americans and Asian-American issues. Remember his ”I know healthcare because I’m Asian and know a lot of doctors” comment? I hope people done refer to him as a representative of Asian-Americans."
18,ftt56l,SO glad another Asian in the media pointed it out. Thank you Jeff!! That op-ed is embarrassing and irritating.
19,ftt56l,[removed]
20,ftt56l,"I mean, the op-ed might be characterized a little too conciliatory, but I certainly don't think its worth all these Asian activists on twitter dunking on him as if he's betrayed the Asian movement or sold out. Yang has a borderline pathological desire to appeal to all sides, but he's still the most high profile Asian American that we've gotten in recent years and has a strong personality. Above all, he did speak about the COVID Anti-Asian racism before any cast member of Crazy Rich Asians did, so there's no need to treat him this harshly just because he has a different approach to things. (Come to think of it, besides Awkwafina who else from Crazy Rich Asians has spoken out about the current Anti-Asian climate?)"
21,ftt56l,[deleted]
22,ftt56l,Bro he isn’t saying that this is the fault of Asians. But we can always help our country out. Saying that this is bootlicking is ignorant. We have a responsibility to help when we can. It’s not like he’s saying Asians have to fix the problem.
23,ftt56l,Yang is a moron. People need to slam him and message him on social media. The guy is a wannabe white boy and his comments are shameful.
24,ftt56l,"The only acceptable thing to do when faced with racism is bitch and moan on twitter, haven't you heard andrew!"
25,ftt56l,"although i agree with jeff yang, what andrew yang said was blown out of proportion. i highly doubt he meant it in that way. it's kind of sad to see asians constantly causing so much negativity within our own community :/"
26,ftt56l,"I don’t agree with Andrew’s OpEd either, but Jeff’s criticism is a bit of a non-sequitur. Just as you shouldn’t have to volunteer at a hospital to “prove” you’re American, you shouldn’t have to be a racial justice activist either. Both are *good* things, of course, but that’s beside the point."
27,ftt56l,"People are overly getting butthurt about this. 

I especially love the commentors who are saying Yang doesn't represent all AA, and then criticize him as if he does represent all AA. Like wtf?"
28,ftt56l,"I'd be curious about the make up of this sub.

I think this is a generational and east vs west coast mentality of asians.

I can see where Yang is coming from. This is an opportunity for a new generation of 442nd to step up.

There is an optics perspective here.

So Asians definitely aren't always the ""most likely to be hired"" compared to their white counterparts. I've also never once been ""lauded"" for my work ethic. Instead, managers simply over time start giving me the more challenging tasks while other coworkers skim by doing more basic tasks. While this may at first seem unfair, it did actually give me the opportunities to stand out.

In short, the left side of the picture isn't as rosy as it sounds, and the right side doesn't have to be as bleak. But it is absolutely true that any POC in the west will face unconscious biases, and will have to work that much harder in order to overcome them."

Contact Angry Asian Man or 8Asians or Reappropriate. Or better yet, maybe something more ""mainstream."" 

This shit has got to stop. First and foremost, we Asian Americans need to recognize this ""divide and conquer"" strategy and stand up to it. We need to recognize the exclusion of straight Asian males, whether it's in the movies or TV shows or books, as a genuine social progress issue because that's exactly what it is. "

**“Mezrich mentioned the stereotypical Hollywood casting process — though most of the actual blackjack team was composed of Asian males, a studio executive involved in the casting process said that most of the film’s actors would be White, with perhaps an Asian female.”**

Remember how much of a sausage-fest Hollywood is. We've all heard of how male-dominated the Academy is, and how there is an extreme dearth of female directors and female writers and female protagonists. We've seen how much less even the top Hollywood actresses get paid compared to the top Hollywood actors. We've seen how little justification Hollywood needs to turn women's stories into men's stories.

In this extremely sexist environment, it's quite telling that the powerful people nevertheless favor the women more than the men when it comes to Asians.

6,2y8xno,"If this was any other race, it would be an outrage. Who do we contact about this? It is apparent that to get any progress in society these days, we need to raise a shitstorm about it. No one seems to be taking Asian men seriously enough. "
7,2y8xno,Wow this story kind of made my blood boil. 
8,2y8xno,"To be fair, The Last Airbender was terrible for a lot of other reasons."
9,2y8xno,"One thing nobody has talked about is the fact that male Kpop groups are just as popular if not more so than female ones. Kpop is actually one of the only forms of media that is is widely consumed by young people today that also shows Asian men as being attractive.

This show is basically  trying to use and possibly control the image and influence that Kpop has on young people using the internet today, and change it in a way that reaffirms racist ideals, such as the idea that only white guys should be portrayed as being attractive, or that Asian women belong to white males.

I think that producer you talked to is trying to undo the unintended, positive effects Kpop is having on certain segments of Western society and repackage it in a way that is palatable to white guys like him.
"
10,2y8xno,"OP, if you're interested, there's also a discussion going on on this over at /r/kpop. [Here's the link](http://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/2y99dm/nickelodeons_make_it_pop_producer_asian_guys_on/)"
11,2y8xno,"Thanks for this post. As an asian american guy, I have to admit I was quite naive to the media portrayal of asian american males and how that affected me. That in turn has led to some of the negative symptoms I'm experiencing. It just seems really unfair for society to prejudge who you are because of the media and everyone's preconceived notions. Sometimes in social settings, I really do feel like a second class citizen because I'm not white."
12,2y8xno,"I'm black. Never been to this subreddit before, but I just wanted to say Asians aren't the only ones that notice. I notice it too. I see those things in movies about Asians or the lack of Asians on TV. Recently when Selfie was airing I thought it was refreshing to see an Asian male as lead. That didn't last long though. "
13,2y8xno,Aren't you at all worried about getting fired over sharing this story? You even named the guy. 
14,2y8xno,Reminds of the first movie with Jet Li and Jackie Chan together. The main character was a white guy lol.
15,2y8xno,"Hmm... Its that Nick show right? Do you think we could have a chance to talk to at least the others producing the show and try to get a statement from the producer? Its sickening that he would just disregard Asian guys in the show then in our perspective, fetishize Asian girls. I got sick reading the response. And having a Nick show like this is only a detriment to kids that are going to be nurtured to that type of media. Like I said, its sickening. Maybe I'm too into this discussion, but I want to see this show become the face of the so called Asian guy imbalance and the fetishization of Asian girls (or an Asian perspective of a Hollywood story in general) because the producer said it verbally himself. Maybe reach out to AngryAsianMan and huffpost? We aren't foreigners. We're American. Americans have a voice. We should too.

EDIT: Just clarifying that especially for the context of the story (kpop), if he's handpicking Asian girls for the show, he has to be handpicking Asian guys, too.

I tell my close non Asian friends about the imbalance (Last Samurai... Omg... And it wasn't as bad as the others). Some end up citing the opposite perspective though (Japanese perspective on the US and how Heirs the kdrama did it was -10/10) but I feel its different because the US has people identified as Americans with a true Asian perspective. Why not have producers look to our perspective? Are we nothing to them? For nick to have a kids show with a TV producer not even going to include an Asian guy child with a normal kid role that he will give to the white guys because he just can't see it happening, the obvious answer is yes. Yes its subtle. But if everyone does the small bad thing all the time and you're a constant victim of it while at the same time people who are non victims constantly play it down because it's small, then of course you'll be bitter and angry.

You can also add Marco Polo to that list. You can have a 90% Asian American cast but its still not enough for me to look at it and say ""not again!"" The eyes and perspective of the story doesn't make up for the apparently diverse cast."
16,2y8xno,"Everybody, to cast some good news in all this gloom and rage, apparently Ki Hong Lee (who was awesome in *The Maze Runner*) is playing Ellie Kemper's love interest in *Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt*. I'm so happy for the guy. The show is getting a ton of positive buzz, and Ellie Kemper is beautiful and hilarious.

And surprise surprise, the show is run by Tina Fey. This once again supports by point that feminists and strong women can be our strongest allies because they have no love for the White patriarchy either, which Asian male emasculation and Asian female fetishization are both products of. I'm sure that smart non-Asian women are getting sick of being told by mouth-breathing White dudes that those dainty and submissive little Asian chicks are so much better than they are. So those women look past all the lies about non-White men, especially Asian men, and give them a fair shot. 

And just to reiterate, I don't think that the solution to racism is Asian dudes always getting with White girls. I understand that this can quickly devolve into colonial mentality. In fact, Ki Hong Lee just got married to his Korean American fiancee, and I'm happy to see a thriving young Korean American couple that will hopefully have a say in our representation for years to come. I'm also happy that guys like Aaron Yoo have married outside their race, and that guys like Harry Shum Jr. have married another Asian ethnicity. "

I think they scared of us.  We work hard as fuck and are cutthroat in business.  Look at the Asian representation in science and tech.  If they admit we are normal or dare say, attractive, then we might outclass them totally.

But anyway its up to individual guys to stand up, work hard and be the change.  "

25,2y8xno,"Frankly disgusts me how he got away with saying that. As you said if it was any other ethnicity (e.g. African-American or hispanic) and was said openly there would be a huge outcry in their communities and the media, but Asians? Hahahaha, who cares apparently. I would highly suggest you would get this out as much as possible to larger AA blogs or the mainstream media because allowing racism like this with no apologies and simply laughing it off is not tolerable. I would say this goes somewhat in how the AA community feels somewhat fractured and lacks any real pushing force compared to other minorities so even if this were to blow up, there would probably be little action or would fade away quickly. While I do admit to being complacent, this really does frustrate me and I am looking into other ways to prevent this from happening or let it be more aware."

Dwayne Johnson is half Samoan and Batista is half filipino, both have done exceptionally well in Hollywood. I guess that's as good as it gets, for now. "
29,2y8xno,"It's only one example, but Glenn in the Walking Dead is Korean, and probably one of the more bad ass ones on the show."
30,2y8xno,Good on you. It's gotten to the point I can't even watch a movie with a generic white male lead in it. People should learn to put their mouth (voice out)   where their money is. 
31,2y8xno,"You know what, Asians should have an activist group or something, because I really don't see many Asian groups like that now. I mean there was the civil rights movement, how about a second coming of that, like an Asian version of it. We also don't have many leaders here either, I mean the only Asians I see on media are ken jeong or some hot Asian chick. Maybe its time we get a bit more aggressive, politically of course."
32,2y8xno,"> Iron Man (The Mandarin is a wimp instead of a bad ass villain)

The Mandarin is an English actor (in the movie and RL). His father was Indian, not sure if that counts as ""Asian"" in this context, Brits consider ""Asian"" immigrants to be from the Indian sub-continent rather than China/Japan/Korea."
33,2y8xno,"people that like kpop like kpop because it is not mainstream american culture, like the music. they seek to go outside the box of the american bubble, and now the american bubble in the form of racist hollywood who see kpop as rising asian male masculinity and value goes against their agenda, they try to shift it into fetishizing asian female and demasculizing asian male, but this wouldn't work because kpop is about sexualizing asian males. hollywood would do everything good about asian culture and asian female, but asian make is a taboo topic. might as well make the lead girl in asian adapted movies white for the white male lead character. because its always the same boring formula over and over, that is why youtube celebrities are more famous than hollywood celebrities, oscars viewership is down 16 percent, movies are rehashed, same old boring white movie about him being the savior. is asian male being seen as normal really a threat to american agenda? is it because of chinese rising soft power? is it the director's own bias against asian male? or his ignorance or a culture or maybe he justs wants to earn a quick buck?"
34,2y8xno,"which network/studio was this? 

personally i've stop going to the movies or more media outlets in general. BUT i still make a point to support any and all movies with a decent asian male roles. even as much as support terminator genysis (which im expecting to be bad)."
35,2y8xno,"Props to you, brother.  If they ever make a movie out of our story this will be a pivotal scene.  Unfortunately, the ""Asian"" guys will be as Asian as Keanu Reeves and Tom Cruise.  "
36,2y8xno,Thank you for bringing this up. I'm so sick of watching the same type of cliche' movies and shows where Asian guys are either goofy or kung fu masters or where the Asians needs to be saved from her super critical Asian family by a White man or they're not represented at all in a show/movie about or based in Asia.
37,2y8xno,"I agree with all the movies you listed, but I just can't help myself from pointing out that you left ""Year of the Dragon"" off the list. It's a Mickey Rourke flick, with John Lone as the crime lord, and it pretty much exemplifies Asians cast in a negative light. All the Chinese women are portrayed as sluts and the Chinese men as either criminals or incompetent.

With that stated, things are still looking better than when I was growing up in the '80s; I had no hope back then. At least now TV shows and movies like Hawaii 5-0, The Walking Dead, and both the Harold and Kumar films are portraying Asian males more positively, and not stereotypically (I haven't seen enough of Fresh Off the Boat to have an opinion). It's getting better, just at an agonizingly slow pace. 

Edit - Which part, ""Year of the Dragon"" or that things are slowly getting better?"
38,2y8xno,"Long comment here so bear with me. 
 I feel as if this Korean Wave craze has been successful financially, but somewhat destructive socially. I mean if you like Korean media go for it, just remember most Kpop is made to cater to foreigners so it is just another soulless money making tool. 
Back to the whole story there. It is very shitty there that The producer doesn't want Asian men on his show. Adding to the white male boyfriend thing angers me even though I'm still a white male in a sense. Most mixed race relationships and such are treated as just another trend or experiment done by couples in most american media. In this case it's another way of cashing in on a ""trend"". "
39,2y8xno,"Not putting shit on your argument, you hold a very valid point. 

However I believe that the wife of Jet Li is strongly against him partaking in love scenes, thats the reason for him not ""getting the girl"" its implied. 

You hold up Red Dawn as an example of prejudice against asians, its a remake of a 1980s movie where it was The Commies as the bad guys. At the time of making it Russia wasnt doing a lot of sabre rattling. NK was, thats more of a geopolitical issue than a race one. Tossing in an Asian hero wouldnt have killed them, Ill grant you that. 

And Ill just point out that Han (Sung Kang) in the F&F franchise is about the coolest motherfucker to make the big screen in the last 10 years. They actually resorted to timeline trickery to unkill his character and keep him in the franchise.

And Jon Cho did a badass job with Mr Sulu in the latest JJ Abrams Trek movies. From memory Abrams wanted Sulu to be an action character because there werent enough Asian action stars.

Not saying that Asian men recieve enough representation on screen, Asian men do deserve more screen time. But forcing diversity into situations where it makes no sense just makes for bad entertainment. Clearly a show about K Pop is a golden opportunity for them to do it, its sad they wont."
40,2y8xno,"> They can be Asian and cool, but only if it serves the fantasies of white men.

See also: Every ""strong"" female character. Hollywood's worship of the white boner is incredibly ~~obnoxious~~ harmful.

46,2y8xno,"The Wolverine (every Asian guy is useless and dies)

Wolverine has always been white. His story takes place in Asia. His adventures usually revolve around killing a bunch of people. Nothing personal. 


Full Metal Jacket (me so horny me love you long time)

The woman in the scene is supposed to be a common whore - not educated. She's clearly a daywalker. Her attitude fits that scene and the movie. Once again, nothing personal. 

In the Last Samurai, the main issue is that historically, Tom Cruise wouldn't be played by an Asian character, but by an Schwartznegger-type character. That's how colonialism worked in those days. 

For the 21 movie (and others like it where Asian people were replaced by Whites), yes, you're spot on."
47,2y8xno,"I think you're being (*semi) unfair to the following:

Man with the Iron Fist -That was RZA's joint so he was def going to lead. There were badass Asian men (one of which was the second lead) and the mistress was also pretty dope. So you should hold that movie in higher esteem.
Romeo Must Die: The hero was Jet Li. It was sanitized for sex but Jet Li was still the romantic interest (and his normal badass self). 
47 Ronin: The One comes back and explores his Asian side. He's a halfy so that should be a half win. You really going to turn down Reeves as a lead? (He's MONEY!)
Entourage: Do you think you can't be awesome and gay? Lloyd did a great job and was heavily featured. He wasn't ""strong"" in the traditional sense but he had his own toughness.
Dragon Ball: ...Umm... Goku is an alien bro. Not sure he should represent any ethnicity and it was hard to relate to as it was. Besides it was a terrible movie and why would you hold that up to the three other people here who watched it.

tl;dr Defending a few movies that I enjoyed... err... watched anyway. Not saying OP is wrong."
48,2y8xno,"What about fresh off the boat? 

Also...holy shit, reading that list, makes me say CONSPIRACY! Mainly about iron man 3...we got that troll on purpose because of racism not bad writing....ouch."
49,2y8xno,Instead of bitching about it maybe some asians just need to get into show business and make it happen.
50,2y8xno,"I agree with the idea that asian males are not represented in american film, but I think the idea that white girls and asian girls don't dig asian dudes in the US is silly.

Maybe it's just because I don't hang out with dumb bimbos, but being asian was more of a boon then a hindrance with my girlfriends - we've got the anime, the food, the interesting culture.  And I know since I mention anime you probably think the girls are fuggs - like any geeky thing the stereotype of below average looks is generally true, but there's still plenty of good looking girls out there who like anime or are very open to other cultures, and I've had great relationships with them.

The majority of asian girls I know have asian boyfriends.

Though this is a valid beef you have with TV, don't blame society for difficulties with asian identity or aspects of personality.  Blacks do it all the time, and it just comes off as ridiculous to anyone with an ounce of sense in their brain; they don't want to take responsibility for their own shortcomings.  If an asian male is having trouble talking to girls or getting dates, it's probably because their social skills need honing, or they're talking to girls that you shouldn't touch with a ten foot pole.  And shit, finding a girl you're compatible with is really tough and takes a long time, no matter what race you are.  It can take a couple years of being single before you find another person that you truly click with.

51,2y8xno,"The creator and producer of ""Let It Pop"" is Nick Cannon.   So I assume he was the person who said in the boardroom meeting, ""Nope! Never! Asian guys in my show, not gonna happen!""

... Nick Cannon is black.

Which is why, I assume, he was able to get away with making that kind of racist comments.  If it was a white man who had made those comments in front of that multiracial boardroom, all hell would have broken loose.  But he is black, so it was all good."
52,2y8xno,"72% of Americas population is white and 4.8% of the population is Asian.

The main charaters of Bollywood, Japanese or Chinese cinema also will be the majority race of there respective countries.

I know i am going to get down voted for this but what you attribute to racism is more to do with the increaseing the profitability of the production. If your target audience consists of 72% white people you are going to make your main characters white. 

I would argue that American Cinema puts in more minority main charaters  than any other countries film industry. 

 I am from Hong Kong so maybe my view point would be different from yours as the cinema's here show Cantonese and American movies. They are both equally created to cater to there target market, which for America is white Americans. 

If you want to watch Asians being bad ass there are tons of movies from any Asian countries which do that. e.g ""The Raid"".

12,s4s0ty,"As a minority, we need to be alert at all time."
13,s4s0ty,"The comments for this article on the main news subs are full of trolls focusing on the fact that the killer is black. So many people care more about turning asian hate crimes into a wedge issue than about the victims themselves. I see this behavior on any article about anti asian violence that makes it to the front page. It's despicable. Sometimes it really feels like we have no support network other than each other.

I've tried to point out and argue against this behavior before but I just got downvoted so much that no one would even see my comments. Our lives lost are used by media and public discourse as pawns to further racial divides. Fuck that."
14,s4s0ty,"History doesn't repeat itself. Humans repeat the same events due to generational biases among ourselves. 50 years ago, it was a black crime, 100 year ago, a native one. Im shaken to my core as a parent raising Asian American toddlers. 

My heart breaks for the loss of life and the family community that this woman was connected to. The takeaway is clear as day here, let no one of Asian descendant be alone. May God be with all of you."
15,s4s0ty,Not to diminish what has happened (or has been happening). I must be on the safer trains or my reduced ridership has effected how I'm around this stuff. No one has bothered to even look at me the wrong way much less say anything racist or threatening. Guess I've been very lucky.
16,s4s0ty,"Very disappointed in a lot of the top comments. I'll explain why and I think this needs to be said even if it's not a popular opinion.

First off, I am not disavowing the fact that there is a striking uptick in violence against asians in the last few years nor am I saying this isn't a heinous crime and a tragedy. But whatever happened to letting the facts come to light before judging a situation to be racially motivated? The article itself lets on that it's unclear if the attack was racially motivated and might have very well been random. There's even that statement from another non-asian woman nearby who felt that she might've been a target as well. The unfortunate truth of the matter is, it's hard to tell right now what in fact was the motive. It might've been but it also might've not.

We need to do better by having a proper assessment of the facts and ambiguities at hand. If you immediately jump to the conclusion that a crime against any person of any ethnicity is racially motivated I feel it diminishes the focus on crimes that in fact clearly are as well as your own credibility."

Playing victim when you are the same people causing A LOT of despair within your own country (and the rest of the world) isn’t a cute look.

I’m not okay with Chinese people (or any east asians let alone human beings in general ) being attacked, embarrassed, etc. But I AM okay with them being called out on bs. So why is it only coronavirus in this sub but when I search to see conversation regarding the camps; no results. Only Chinese and Japanese users talking about historical events within America"

She was helping her landlord by sweeping the sidewalk in front of her   
apartment last Thanksgiving weekend when she was bashed with a rock on   
the side of her head. She has been in a coma since but woke up briefly a  
 couple of weeks ago.This news hits hard. We were helping her   
husband with therapy through our Heal from Hate fund and had been   
texting her landlord for months. We were all so hopeful for her   
recovery, and I truly cannot imagine what her family is going through.“She’s  
 so sweet. She helps the friends, neighbors, she helps everybody,” the   
victim’s sister Jing Zhang said. She just helping out and minding her   
own business when she was murdered.This injustice is unacceptable. The system failed her and she deserved so much more."

I'm honestly done with the peaceful, ""kumbaya"" type approach to trying to raise attention to Asian hate crimes. It's clear the watered-down approach isn't helping matters and American society as a whole still doesn't care about the issues facing our communities, despite all this. 

I'm not sure what the best approach is, but it's clear the current approach is just too soft and not working."

3,bl6rn5,Is it common for Filipinos to tell their kids to date white people? Because that’s pretty fucked.
4,bl6rn5,100% relate. And not teaching children Tagalog is especially prevalent in Filipino-Americans. We are the “Invisible Asian” and tend to meld with the culture we are in so much so that we forget to pass on our own language to our kids.
5,bl6rn5,"I know this comic is aimed towards Filipinos though I feel most Asians can relate to some of the messages.

I'm Korean/Chinese and I've definitely heard the part about getting dark and being in the sun (ironically mostly from my mother, who, though pale-skinned herself, comes from a family of mostly darker complexion people). I've never been told to ""date whites only"" nor ""no asians..."" and while my parents have never told me explicitly who I could or couldn't date, they've slightly hinted at dating Asian guys. And thankfully nothing about my physical traits because, thanks, I can't control that."

0,gqbejg,"I mean, the reality is that some of them do hate the Chinese people. The US administration and media have been stirring up this anti-China pot for years now, and it's taken a hold on the general public. These people don't care to make a difference between the CCP and the Chinese people, and eventually this dehumanization of the Chinese is going to lead to war. I think all of us should prepare ourselves for what's coming and think about what we are to do in that situation."
1,gqbejg,"Reddit is incredibly anti-China. Just look at anything related to Chinese tech like Huawei and racism will come out strong. 

With so many Americans on Reddit I think there is a strong us versus them mentality that is ingrained into the culture. There will never be a middle road or consensus on anything posted in the main subs unfortunately."
2,gqbejg,"Racists love plausible deniability. that we can’t tell if they mean Chinese people or the ccp is the point. 

That if you call them out for racism and they can just switch to saying they mean the ccp not chinese is the point."
3,gqbejg,"I agree. The first thing I think of when I hear “China” is the country itself and all its people. So if they mean to say they hate the chinese government specifically and not the people, then they need to clarify. That’s a big statement to make and should be clear others what they mean otherwise I take it as them trying to justify a shitty comment"
4,gqbejg,"If you’ve read Manufacturing Consent by Noam Chomsky you’ll know exactly what I mean when America has been stroking the flames with China for many years now. I’d say this is because of China’s rapid economic growth, and initiatives like BRICs and the Belt and Road initiative which makes it less reliant on the mostly american-controlled global economic system. I would recommend watching The Coming War on China, by British filmmaker and journalist John Pilger, and reading Manufacturing Consent by Noam Chomsky. These two pieces of media are the best answer to your question."

In a word: fuck this."

9,gqbejg,"I don't think it's *that* ridiculous to use a country's name when referring to that country's government. These are political entities to begin with. While it's true that there is certainly a racist angle to a lot of the ""fuck China"" stuff, I would argue that *most* redditors don't mean it that way. This is especially clear when the context of those comments is praising the Chinese people of Hong Kong and Taiwan.

I think the reason why it stings for many Chinese Americans is that they still harbor an identification with the concept of ""China."" Similarly, a lot of people around the world have good reason to bash the United States, and when I hear it, I can't help but feel a bit defensive about it even when I know that they're not criticizing me personally."

Lol what? You don’t like her show because you have to understand her through subtitles and a translator? Wtf is wrong with people"
1,aoi40n,The most nonsensical thing is that she’s obviously not telling anyone what to do. She is offering advice *for people who want it*. 
2,aoi40n,"They can't handle the fact that cultures/traditions/people beyond Europe have anything to offer.

If any philosophy or art doesn't have roots in the Enlightenment, European Renaissance, or Roman and Greek classicism, they don't want to know about it except as exotic counterpoint, sidenotes, or trivia."
3,aoi40n,"The funny thing about this situation is that she's considered to have this whole bossy ideal which is just nonexistent. It's just the shitty media and people with their warped perceptions who want to make her seem worse than she even is. When you watch her show, she emits wholesome vibes and wants people feel good about removing clutter and having peace of mind in their lives. That's all lol."
4,aoi40n,"They'll praise Martha Stewart for saying the exact same things that Marie Kondo is talking about in her book and Netflix show, so yeah people are just straight up racist and xenophobic."
5,aoi40n,"They subscribe to the idea of the “quiet, passive” Asian and they REALLY hate it if you so much as voice your opinion instead of nodding along with them."
6,aoi40n,"On a positive note I’m glad this is happening to shine light on this issue of racism against Asian women and that all the nasty closet racists are coming out of the woodwork. Maybe Marie Kondo can help us find a method to clean out America of all these trashy people, or at least clean out all the trash that resides in them. 

The funny thing is she isn’t telling anyone to get rid of the things they love. If all 500 books on your shelf sparks joy for you then you can keep all 500 books.  Nobody is telling you to throw away things you don’t want to throw away. Nobody is saying you must subscribe to minimalism. 

It just comes to show some people will find offense in anything. Clearly they’re just riding on the bandwagon and making such opposing statements to draw attention to themselves. They’re like leeches that latch onto anything and anyone relevant.

But anywho I love these quotes so much I almost want to make a giant banner or a t-shirt out of them. I’m glad someone is saying it. It’s so true.

> There’s a sort of lateral violence at play in the Tidying Up discourse in how white women will sometimes deliberately misunderstand or talk over women of color. 

> White people really don’t like when they feel like an Asian woman is telling them what to do.
"
7,aoi40n,"It obviously is. The backlash is a proof that white privilege is real, and that white people -- white liberals included -- are not willing to let go of their privilege and racism. They just *allow* nonwhites to succeed and then pat themselves in the back for being ""antiracist"". In this case, they didn't *allow* Marie Kondo. Hence, 
backlash. They are afraid that PoCs will empowered. Empowered PoCs mean loss of white privilege."
8,aoi40n,"All the anti-Kondo hate and hot takes do not spark joy, nor do they deserve to be appreciated.  They should be discarded immediately as well as the people who are willfully ignorant enough to blindly agree with said hot takes."
9,aoi40n,">She literally just wants to help people declutter so their physical belongings no longer take a mental toll on their well-being.

Now with that being said, and after watching her first episode. I find that her method is tackling against consumerism. Consumerism exploits on people buying things that they don't need and preying on their insecurities and her method is showing exactly what have been going on. 


For example, laying out all of the mess that bother you. Clothing is a huge culprit of that with the trend going from season to season. She suggested that you should first **appreciate** the things that you have, even when you planned to throw them away. I feel like this give you a sense of content with what you have, and not have the mindset of, *""oh, I just got rid  of a lot of clothes I don't like, time to shop for more!""* And have the mindset of *""look at all the choices I can wear, now that I finally organize the clothes that I once love. I can recreate the excitement I felt when I first bought these clothes!""* Overall, I see her as a gem that the Japanese culture have gifted us, for our mental health and stop being exploited by consumerism."
10,aoi40n,"My local paper had a column calling her a virus, disease, and insinuated that she needed mental care. So yeah, racism seems pretty spot on. "

Timely article, I was just telling a friend how people will never be happy with a woman 'telling' people what to do. Even less so when it's a non-white woman. Meanwhile, Liam Neeson is out there admitting to wanting to kill any random black man after his friend was raped and white folks are praising him for his courage or some bullshit like that. All noise."
13,aoi40n,Yeah honestly it's just culture clash.  There are some of closeminded bigots but still many more open minded people. I enjoy her show and been motivated to clean house!
14,aoi40n,"Another shenanigans by white women especially is critiquing KonMari when they themselves have not read the books nor seen the series! Like this blogger: https://wp.me/p7vdSg-d43

Basically, they are making a lot of assumptions based on second hand (mis)information by fellow whites.

Imagine critiquing Nietze without reading his works!"
15,aoi40n,"I think the obvious solution is that more Asian Women should be placed in more positions of power, so as to train wypipo to stop being resentful, messy assholes. "
16,aoi40n,"Most people I know who have read or watched Kondo love her. The ones who don’t could have a lot of reasons why they don’t like her methods. 

But I think the main reason some people don’t like her is because hoarding and being messy for some odd reason is a badge of honor among some Americans. The whole “messy house, happy kids,” or “my house isn’t a mess, my kids are building memories” bullshit you see on crappy wooden signs at craft stores. These people don’t like to be told that what they’re doing is unhealthy and potentially damaging.

18,aoi40n,"Can anyone sort of sum up what the news is with Marie Kondo? What did she do and why is it such a big deal? It seems like her show is all about minimalism, where does the 'telling white people what to do' thing come into it?"
19,aoi40n,Jesus fucking christ! I couldn't even finish reading the article because of how the critics are calling her either hate names or making her as a some sort of a exotic Asian doll. I literally can't stand that shit and I'm not even gonna finish reading it because it's stressing me the FUCK out.

I feel like the crackers in control of things(companies, depts, whatever) will do things in a  subtle way(not blunt but still very sexist, racists, etc) to stay in control. My two cents. "

24,aoi40n,My mom has been following Marie Kondo for awhile now. The way she was always described to me as a person who helps others and provides a guidances; my mom has even gone to share some of Marie Kondo’s advice.

0,64uneb,"I think continuing to have conversations with (and occasionally call out) members of our own race is important. For instance, last year, my Asian cousin threatened to unfriend me on facebook for sharing a picture of a BLM protest I attended. I asked her why, and she ignorantly told me that ""Black Lives Matter"" is racist, and we should be saying ""All Lives Matter"". 

Today, she posted an article about the excessive force and officer brutality that Chinese doctor faced on United, and she encouraged us to boycott the airline. I took the opportunity to say something to the effect of, well, this is exactly why we need to support BLM... we need to have solidarity with other groups if we are going to demand justice for any wrongdoings committed against our own. I then went on to compare how the way the airline and the media are treating this man (victim-blaming him by bringing up his criminal history and portraying him as a criminal who deserved the violence) is exactly what we do to black victims of violence. I'm very happy, and albeit very surprised, to say that she just replied minutes ago and said she agreed with me. This gives me hope, that having these hard conversations, and holding our people accountable to their words, will be worth it."
1,64uneb,"I think the biggest obstacle you'll probably face is people saying ""well Asians are antiblack so why should I care?"" and I see that sentiment reversed on some Asian subs, furthering the divide. But I think it will be important to remind them that there are Asians working on antiblackness in our community and together, we can be more powerful than divided. I think simple things like correcting previous assumptions about stuff like the model minority myth and other stereotypes or calling someone out when they say something racist against Asians can be important steps forward.  And be honest about your own journey, admit that you too had preconceived notions and now you've learned better and people will be able to relate to that. Change doesn't happen over night but anything you do will still make a difference. "
2,64uneb,"Fellow black dude who browses this sub here. I think we all gotta address issues that we have against other minority communities whether that be anti-blackness, Islamophobia, anti-Asian sentiment and so on but seeing minorities come together to fight against white supremacy is honestly one of the most empowering things for me. It reminds us that we're not alone in this fight, and that we can build bridges with other folks who face similar racism and prejudice.

Reminds me of [this](https://twitter.com/Chemzes/status/825802084478021636) great pic from the Muslim Ban protests. We got too many enemies already to keep fighting within each other. "
3,64uneb,"One thing I haven't seen mentioned is some black people have a tendency to lump Asians in with white people. I live in a slight majority black area and I've had a lot of black people that like to sort of light heartedly talk about the struggles of being black, but they tell it to me like I wouldn't understand. Like I had a woman tell me how in a business setting she was one of the only black people there and it was uniquely difficult thing for her. She didn't have any sympathy when I pointed out I was literally the only Asian. She assumed it didn't give me the same outsider status as her. That always kind of hurts because, at the end of the day, she has the black community and black resources to go to for support. I don't have an Asian American community here and my school's diversity team (all black) always forgot to send me stuff about minority networking events. I only got included occasionally for being female. "
4,64uneb,✊️YELLOW PERIL SUPPORTS BLACK POWER✊🏿
5,64uneb,"I think just discussing with any black folks you know about similarities between black and Asian experiences goes a long way. It's easier for people to understand when they feel like they can relate. For instance, for myself, one thing I learned not too long ago was that in the Western United States during the 1800s and early 1900s, Asian men were often the target of lynchings for similar reasons why black men were lynched - they ""looked"" at a white woman the wrong way, competition over jobs, etc. Though obviously I still thought lynchings of blacks (or anyone of any race) is horrible, of course, learning that helped me understand it less from an intellectual standpoint, and more about how that is some part of history that still haunts African-Americans - because it is connected to Asian-American history too. As another example, I also learned not too long ago, that at the turn of the 20th century in parts of the deep south, blacks and poor whites actually banded together to fight against wealthy elites, and bring their own candidates into local elections for example. The two groups realized they had a common enemy, could relate, and worked together. The alliance fell apart when said elites made concessions to the poor whites but not the blacks.

Another aspect of this is that racism against blacks and Asians are two sides of the same coin. Take how black men and Asian men are portrayed in the media for instance. Black men are stereotyped athletes, or aggressive and hypermasculine, have big dicks, etc. Asian men are nerdy virgins, passive, effeminate, have small dicks, etc. What is the point of this? It makes white men ""just right"" and a happy medium. So connecting the stuff that blacks and Asians deal with I think helps too.

So if you can somehow make people see the similarities and shared experiences, it can help. Unfortunately of course some people might interpret it as you saying X has it worse than Y, but that's why you'll have to be very tactful in your wording so it doesn't turn into Oppression Olympics.

It'll be harder to get this through to older folks of any race I think. My father spent part of his childhood in a mostly black neighborhood and though he's fairly more open-minded for an older 1.5 generation Asian (like he won't give a shit if I marry a black girl), he still has a lot of predujices, and a lot of it is due to the bad history between Asians and blacks.

I dunno. Props to you for trying to understand another side. Life would be so much better if people understood each other, but alas. But lastly, best not to get too upset and brooding about it. The fact that even one person - you - is trying to bridge the gap is already a great thing.

EDIT: All the while, I also think it's important not too come off too much as a ""let's sing kumbaya and hold hands because everybody is speshul"" sort of idealist either, of course. African-American and Asian-American experiences (and that of every race/ethnicity/culture, really) have a lot of shared threads and similarities, but there are differences too. But I'm not sure how easy it will be to discuss the nuances. People never like having nuances. It's easier to discuss huge blobs.

EDIT 2: I'm not sure if you know any, but there are a number of what I guess you might call ""black weaboos,"" or African-Americans who are into Asian culture (usually Japanese or Korean pop culture) to the point where some fetishize it. Like with other non-Asians who are super into Asian culture - or anyone who idealizes any other race or culture for that matter - they present a somewhat different animal to tackle. I'm not sure how exactly you'd get the point across to them about Asian/Asian-American issues and experiences, to be honest, because they usually *sort of* get it, but, on the other hand, sort of don't, so they think they're sympathetic and understanding, but they're actually not, and sometimes those people can be very hard to convince that their attitudes have unfortunate implications. Perhaps the best thing for those kinds of people is to somehow get it into their heads that Asians are people too, just like them, with their good points and their bad points and all that. (Of course, it's worth pointing out just because, say, a non-Asian person loves watching anime or listens to K-pop a lot doesn't mean they're necessarily fetishizing Asians - and the ones that don't in fact I've found tend to be the most understanding and sympathetic to Asian-American issues, precisely because due to the pop culture they consume they see Asians as people - but the line can be blurry.) I feel like there might be some vague similarities with people who idealize ""gangsta"" culture or something.

6,64uneb,"Also Black, and I'm here to say that after living in Germany for half a year (so by all means I'm no expert) I've found asian people to be incredibly fetishized to the point that some folks will literally post on social media how they're specifically looking for asian men/women. It's bizarre, and quite frankly I feel like here there is a massive amount of stereotypes about asians though actual discrimination isn't really that obvious. Granted, I've seen Germans do the same shit to Native American/Mestizos I've met so it doesn't seem to be exclusively  confined to a single race. All I'm saying is that it's a different ballgame in other parts of the world. 

That said, I've NEVER understood why both communities (Black and Asian) are so racist to one another. In fact that first person who called me a nigger was actually Filipino (ironic given the history), but I've also found out my older brother used to actively target a group of asian kids at my old HS and he developed a reputation. Shit never ceases to amaze me since we honestly have more in common than not, but the older generation really has a major effect on how we view our peers. Already coming from the Bay Area I've already seen how ridiculous the entire animosity dynamic between different minority races is. "

8,64uneb,"Thanks so much for writing this and reaching out.

I read an article today at a black blog site saying that what happened to the Asian-American guy on the United flight is what happens to black people all the time. I commented to thank the writer for the piece and that I hoped that people of color could be allies. I got a couple of comment replies that were decidedly lukewarm that I felt kind of negated my experience. Of course, as someone seeking to be an ally, my position was to accept what people were saying and just say in turn that I was there to listen and learn.

So I guess one thing that would be cool is to encourage people in communities you participate in to be welcoming of other minority people who sincerely want to work together against racism. IMO encouraging positive attitudes, communication, and partnership is as important and maybe even more important than just calling out negative behavior/attitudes.

Personally, anyone in this sub who expresses racism, sexism, bigotry of any kind is not at all welcome."
9,64uneb,"Even acknowledging the existence of anti-Asian sentiment is such a big step and I'm seriously so thankful for your post because it's really what I've been needing over the past few weeks. The way anti-Asian racism gets a pass in POC groups has been so tiring. I think it's really about taking the time to actually understand the nature of anti-Asian racism in America. While it's definitely necessary for Asians (& everyone else) to learn about anti-black racism in America (due to, well, American history), people can get away without bothering to examine anti-Asian racism because the *nature* of that racism is much *different* and we're a small minority. The Asian experience looks different but that doesn't mean it's not racism. 

Then I think it's important to understand that non-Asian POC can still contribute to the dehumanizing of Asians, and that shouldn't be acceptable, just as anti-blackness shouldn't be acceptable in Asian communities. I saw a selfie the other day of a non-Chinese person wearing a qipao w/ stereotypical twin buns and claiming that it was ok because Asians are anti-black (this person has a black background). But the existence of anti-blackness doesn't somehow negate that black people can commit actions that harm Asians? In that case Chinese people were being mocked and exoticized. Other POC don't have a right to disrespect our culture and contribute to our mistreatment, just like *we* don't have a right to do that to other POC. I feel like people want an easily defined vertical hierarchy (like whites vs. POC), but it isn't that simple between minorities... there are struggles Asians don't face but there are also struggles that are unique to Asians. It's bizarre how anti-Asian racism is still so accepted in POC communities - you can see it everywhere, even in ""socially aware"" circles, which are full of non-Asians fetishizing Asian culture or trashing Asians.

Personally, even if some black people have not been nice, I feel solidarity with black people because I feel we all know what's up. I think black people can keep us as allies if they just remember not to act like they are punching down when dealing with us. People shouldn't practice Chinese or Japanese with us.

17,64uneb,"Good for you for being openminded and wanting to enact some changes! I think there are a lot of problems in the Asian-Am and Black communities that really can divide us, mainly how defensive (not all, but most) people on both sides can get when we try to discuss issues. It's always ""well, they have it better!"" or ""they don't fight for us so who cares about them?"" -- I understand the bitterness since there are years and years of misunderstanding leading to things like Korean storeowners getting targeted during the LA Riots etc.

I live in NYC and unfortunately, the majority of the outright and blatant racist comments/actions directed towards me comes from non-whites. Sadly I think in my younger years this led to me harboring racist thoughts towards blacks and latinos -- but what changed things for me was that I eventually became friends with a bunch of black and latino people who had similar interests as me. For that I'm super thankful for having lived in the city; being in proximity to and talking to people automatically makes you more empathetic of their personal struggles and makes it easier to relate as *people*. It's not a revolutionary concept but it's really one of the main things that get people working together.

So yeah, if you don't have a ton of Asian friends, make some and start talking frankly about these issues. Encourage your non-Asian POC friends to talk to us more. "

There is a divide amongst us, but, I think, much less than white fiction would have it.

There is a long lineage of Black and Asian solidarity.  And it extends to now:

Mills argues that racism is at the core of the ""social contract"", rather than racism being an unintended result attributed to the failings of imperfect men. Specifically, the racial contract is a tacit (and at times explicit) agreement among members of the tribes of Europe to assert, promote, and maintain the ideal of white supremacy as against all other tribes of the world. This intention is deliberate and an integral characteristic of the social contract, a characteristic which persists to the present day. In Mills' words, ""...what has usually been taken...as the racist 'exception' has really been the rule; what has been taken as the 'rule'...\[racial equality\]...has really been the exception."" Mills argues however, that these ideals of the social contract are at worst pure fiction or at best were intended only to apply to a specific group of people, namely members of the tribes of Europe and their genetic descendants. ""...when white people say 'Justice,' they mean 'Just Us'.

In regards to the xenophobic rhetoric that the Twitter user is talking about, it’s kinda sad to see that Chinese people are getting shit on. I don’t really use Twitter even though I have an account, but I wouldn’t be surprised if this is happening on the site. I think the worst part about this is the fact that racist and xenophobic people can’t even bother to differentiate Asian people, so they’ll see you as one of them and think you’re bad news.

9,b02hj3,"I think the way Andrew Yang started off was really smart. He chose to go on small scale podcasts, YouTube videos, local news stations rather than jumping straight to anything on nation TV. This is smart because he knows that you need to create a strong base (YangGang) and hit various corners of the internet. These communities, if you can win them over, they will fight for you. 

So when he went on Joe Rogan, Sam Harris, Ezra Klein, The Breakfast Club, oddly....Tucker Carlson, he is anchoring specific demographics that slightly overlap. So the more shows he goes on, the more people will connect the dots. It’s basic human nature. If people in the comments section of a community you generally agree with love him, then more people from that demographic are likely to be receptive as well. 

If he continues hitting up a few more of these major podcasts/ YouTube channels for the rest of March to secure even more groups, come April he will be ready for prime time. By then his following with be much broader and he can then try to convince all the older people who only watch cable news. 

I’m pretty supportive of Yang, and honestly it’s just fun to see someone rise up so dramatically in a matter of weeks. Very interested in seeing how far he will go. So far the right and center don’t hate him, and many love him. Very strange in this time. "

4,kp8zaj,Where the dipping sauce at?
5,kp8zaj,"Mmmm yes! Game-changer. My family was gifted a dual hot pot during Christmas time and it is so much fun to enjoy hot pot foods at home. Wonderfully thin-sliced meats, fishcakes, tofu, veggies, and noodles galore.

I know he’s talking about the losers who are pushing over old folks, but we as asians need to do a better job of being a part of other people’s lives. old and young, meeting more people who aren’t like us and who don’t reinforce our community. it’s a struggle for the older generation who may not speak english but there are plenty of common activities that can showcase our culture side-by-side with other cultures. it starts with us, don’t wait for someone else to befriend you."

4,lhtpv4,"Not to take away from the incident, but I'm literally cracking up at the guy. Wonder how many brain cells he burned trying to come up with that insult. Could literally see the gears turning in his head trying to come up with something and after all that thinking, that's the best he could come up with? Stupid blue hair asian girl?

Lol, mans head is so round that he grew a beard to hide his lack of a jawline. Probably a former frat boi who dropped a little too much ecstasy back in his day. Drank too many 30 racks and now he's permanently drunk. After thinking about it, I think the most likely situation was that he got dropped on his head. Not as a baby though, that'd be too good for him. If anything he got dropped on his head by his frat bros while doing a kegger."

6,lhtpv4,"It’s so weird how much he’s struggling to come up with insults as the aggressor. It’s like he woke up that morning and thought, “Todd, let’s try something new today. Let’s go insult some... some... stupid... stinky... uh, uh, Asian.”"

2,lsfur1,"""As an Asian, Asian people are super racist. My parents/ grandparents HATE black people and they HATE other asian people of any kind""

Top comment on every post about anti-asian racism, followed by ""its true, im Asian and i am a racist"""
3,lsfur1,"To add onto gaslighting, I learned about [stochastic terrorism](https://np.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/lre72d/attack_on_asian_american_air_force_veteran_in/gopnyny/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) in this sub. It's best to also take breaks from social media if it becomes too overwhelming. I think it's good that you let your non-Asian friends know about this especially if they are willing to listen to you and respect what you have to say. Meaningful conversations can start from there and maybe they can also educate others as well."
4,lsfur1,You are right to rant. It’s stupid how they don’t see how justifying their stance to be complacent as racist.
5,lsfur1,"some ppl will (rightfully) get mad at when asians generalize other poc, but then will generalize us all back and say we're all complicit with the CCP or something?? like i dont get it"
6,lsfur1,"It seems that Asians are only mentioned when we benefit an argument. In the end, we are alone, with no one to fight for us. Even worse, so many of our own stay quiet about it because we were taught to just mind our own business and work hard towards success. We live in a different age where working hard doesn't equate to success as racial tension in the US actually limits our abilities to rise higher and claim what we deserve based on our knowledge and skills. 

I felt like a lot of my Asian American friends were posting about uniting for BLM but now they're pretty quiet about all of these anti-asian violence attacks. I do see some news reports being posted but nothing like calling for equality and justice. It seems like they fought for other POC harder than they are fighting for their own."
7,lsfur1,"I always say to people who make those comments with “feeling wronged by a race is not a justification for complacency of prejudice or racism” 

And usually they just shut up and realize what they’re saying is messed up. People are only anti racist when it is their own people, this is also true for many Asians who don’t give af about other races and complain why nobody also cares about us. Thus we have an endless cycle. 

I understand it’s frustrating, my encouragement to you is to always stay a good person. It is tempting to be spiteful out of anger but the best way to get people to care about our problems is continue showing that we will not become bitter people and will keep demanding for respect"
8,lsfur1,"Being adopted into a white family who didn’t talk about race besides black/white issues, COVID was the first time I truly felt how little it anybody else cared about us. I used to believe it was POC vs. white people and that all of us always stood together. As I got more Asian friends in late middle school and high school, I realized that was not true, as I heard my own friends talk about how their parents were racist against other races. I also was beginning to encounter a lot more casual racism against me from other people, not just the white ones, in my high school. I felt what it was to be called slurs and put into boxes and to feel so alone. Shit hurts. In light of the recent media spotlight on violence against Asians in America and the big blow-up in the social media spaces particularly involving black and Asian people speaking on the topic, it was so fucking disheartening to see a lot of the top tweets were from accounts of black people talking about tit for tat. Twitter itself and the quality of many of its users is a whole other discussion, but I couldn’t believe it. It hurts me to see how anti-black a lot of Asian people, many older, but too many younger, are. But I believe so much that that is not all of us at all. We’re fighting to be better. I know people are saying that black people and BLM don’t owe Asians anything, but I disagree. I think all people of color owe it to each other to fight for one another because in the end, we’re all pushed down by the same thing. To try to create a hierarchy of discrimination doesn’t seem productive in the slightest. There is always something worse, and that is terrible, but it is true. People should never feel afraid to speak up for being treated with disrespect, especially when they have traditionally been forgotten, and the actions of some should never speak for the actions of all. I know so many black people stand with us and Twitter is often a vocal minority, but it all just feels so heavy right now. You’re not alone. We’re all tired."
9,lsfur1,"You’re not wrong at all. There’s a certain tinge of xenophobia to the prejudice and racism that we face of constant “otherness” that always gets ignored. Not to mention, I keep hearing about how anti-Asian sentiment only popped up during COVID19 when South Asian Americans were struggling hard after 9/11 for being brown and that anti Asian sentiment is baked into the history of this country since we’ve immigrated here from the Chinese Exclusion Act onwards in some way, it just always gets downplayed by these whataboutisms :/"
10,lsfur1,"I feel this. I read something that opened my eyes the other day. Someone was making fun of how asian exchange students on their campus only stick together, and someone replied that it's more a testament to how *exclusive* others are - rather then how asians only want to be friends with other asians. It's true, we are often so dismissed and our struggles so unheard that it feels nice to have a group of friends that understand first hand the hate we face. I wish there were more safe and welcoming places for asians to talk about their struggles, but even online in places dedicated to talking about trauma, racism, and minority issues I have found people don't want to hear it. Thanks for posting, I honestly believe now is the time more then ever to keep talking about these issues and spread awareness. Even when people don't agree."
11,lsfur1,"I hear you. I came here for the same reason. America can’t care for more than one race at a time. I can tell you that aside from family and a few Asian friends, none of my “woke” non-Asian friends have wanted to engage with me on this (this is Washington, DC btw—woke nation). And if they do engage, they skirt around the perpetrator’s culpability and the victims’ right to justice and jump straight into “solidarity”, “healing”, “raising awareness”, “blame white supremacy”. I’m done with that shit. That doesn’t sound like justice to me."
12,lsfur1,">or that it’s time for us to finally learn what real oppression feels like.

There were lots of indentured servants that were asians. The highest lynching was to asian americans of over 100+.  Lots of open hatred for asians. Idk, what these people are trying to do.. or maybe I do? 

There was the yellow power movement that was inspired from the black power movement. Lots of asians fought for equality for asians decades past. 

Having said all that I am a believer that at least a portion of the blame has to be our inactivity or our poor narrative control. Or maybe people are controlling our narrative more than we know..  Regardless, it does seem like many asians do not see themselves like a minority which is a wild delusion. And many asians think they are white which is edging very close to mental delusion unless there is such a thing as transitioning your cultural identity for lack of a better term. There does seem to be a need to re-strategize and re tell the narrative."
13,lsfur1,"Man don't go too deep on Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok I see that shit all the time on there"
14,lsfur1,"I'm black, Asian and Hawaiian. But most people see me as black.  I personally grew up in Hawaii so my phone experience is very different. Anti-Asian sentiment is not seen much from other minorities there. 

Now that I'm on the mainland US, I've heard a few people talk shit about my old boss calling her a ""dragon lady,"" it doesn't help that she's racist and owns a business in a black neighborhood. Not that it makes it right. It's just weird. 

I've also experienced some... Wariness, suspicion? Avoidance? I guess I'd describe it from Asians here. Which fucked with me a lot since I grew up with the Asian side of my extended family. (The other side is in the Bay area.)

Either way I've only seen a little inter-minority racism and will not tolerate it when I do. But it seems like there's a lot more out there judging from the news articles I keep seeing posted. (Though some of those people appear to be concern trolling white folks.)

I honestly don't know what to say here about this aside from please don't let your heart harden because division is what keeps us all down.  And I will continue to call racial prejudiced shit out when I see it. I hope you will too."
15,lsfur1,"Or the whole “Asians are very anti-Black” so we don’t deserve to speak about anti-Asian violence. So many Asians I know including I have acknowledged the anti-Blackness within our communities and try to change the older folk’s perspective. I’ve seen hordes of Asians on the West Coast join Black Lives Matter rallies, yet many Blacks refuse to acknowledge the Asian support they get. They even made claims saying White people are more supportive because they see more sea of white faces in BLM rallies. I’m sorry, but I didn’t realize you have to join a rally to care for Black people’s lives? Honestly, Asians just want to work hard and not bother anyone yet we’re the prime targets of almost every race."
16,lsfur1,"I’ve seen a lot of black people retweet and support pro Asian activism recently. The only pushback I’ve seen is when Asians preface their activism with resentfulness of the success of BLM. Some of the criticisms I’ve seen:

>Do people have performative allyship, absolutely. Do the violent crimes being committed against Asians need to stop, absolutely. At any point in time during those conversations do you need to bring a BLM… Absolutely not

>Since I am not Asian, I can’t comment on that part. Your feelings are absolutely valid, I just find it troubling that BLM is used as the crux and the cornerstone when it comes to other races and their struggles...

I think people forget that BLM was like 8 years in the making. And that 8 years itself was built on a lot of older activism too. They forced the media to pay attention though years and years of work. We don’t have that. A lot of more recent Asian immigrants may not know about older Asian activism and may not be particularly feel connected to it. 

Think about the most prominent Asians political protests movements in the last years were stuff like Asians coming out to defend Peter Liang or Asians protesting Harvard against affirmative action.

Those are arguably the most high profile political actions by Asians, and Those issues weren’t exactly things u can build an interracial coalition with. In fact both of those things pit Asians interests vs other minority interests.


If you’re pissed ur friends were there for BLM but not Asian, go talk to them about it. Most of my friends who were there for BLM are sharing pro Asian stuff.  Asians talk about BLM like BLM is pulling the strings behind the scenes and stoping news coverage of this shit.
 
Go get the people who caped for Peter liang and get a March going. If you block off a freeway entrance, they’ll be forced to cover it.

Also with BLM, the focus was against a specific organization(pigs) and you can point at them and demand specific changes in policy towards that organization. 

These attacks are more random, there is no  specific organization to rally against. That’s probably one factor in the media  visibility issues. You can’t get on tv and call  the anti Asian Leader to resign or whatever. Cause there is none. Keep that in  mind"
17,lsfur1,"It is very dispiriting the way anti-asian and anti-Asian American bigotry seems so suffuse. 

That’s the vile thing about white supremacy in how it inevitably tries to pit us all against each other. And even the people who seem to outwardly posture toward anti-racism indulge it in some fashion as if it were the goddamn oppression olympics.

And we are not even some people United in some common experience except for how society views us. Which complicates it even further.

To resist the disappointing reality of well reality is hard. You have my sympathy. I wish the world were better and kinder."
18,lsfur1,"I’m another kind of minority, I guess. Middle Eastern, which is technically Asian but constantly lumped in with whites based on the most flimsy and racist logic. So I’m not trying to make this about my group or anything since technically we are in different groups. I’m sorry we aren’t more united, and that we don’t have the solidarity to fight. Middle Eastern people are exactly as you described “Asians” to be. Too big of a group to even lump together, and so radically different from our non-American counterparts, and constantly overlooked as if what happens to us isn’t real or doesn’t matter as much. Constantly being told by whites and other races “what you are” and how we’re too close to white to matter as minorities. I completely understand and for what it’s worth, I’m sorry if middle eastern people are doing that to you or not willing to be allies with you. If anyone from my race or any other race said (or did) something derogatory to Asians in front of me, I would / will call it out. I will keep listening to the news of what’s happening to the Asian community and how you are being targeted. I have always been allies with other minority groups, so I can’t really speak to what’s going on between Asians and non-Asian POC or the black community. I know what you are talking about but I also think that has been going on since WAY before covid-19. There’s always been tension there and non black minorities are always kind of targets in black neighborhoods the same way we are in white neighborhoods or any other place where we aren’t dominant which is literally everywhere. 

I think all other minority groups have really solid spaces where they actually aren’t the minority anymore. Asians don’t really, middle eastern people don’t either. No matter what, we are ALWAYS the odd one out. Larger minority groups like black, Latin, women, lgbt, just have more voices and more “spaces.” 

Two more things and I’ll be done:  For one, it absolutely just KILLS me how Middle Eastern people have been called terrorists for decades, even when we are just being normal Americans and literally acts of white terror are everywhere and nobody treats them like that. I really think a similar thing is happening with the Asian community where nobody is taking you seriously because of the stuff from your home countries that they don’t agree with and just pin on you like it makes ANY sense at all. Similar to how white people lump together all Africans or all Africans vs black Americans when they couldn’t be more different. Literally everything is just based on how people look. 

Also, I still think at the heart of every problem is coagulated white supremacy and unregulated capitalism. We can’t solve the problems between us because things are kind of designed to keep us at each other instead of worried about getting generational wealth. But I don’t think now is the time to be “tired of talking about race” like many people even here in this thread are. Not to tell you guys what to do but my opinion is just that it would be too infuriating to fight for all of these causes and care for all these years like many of us have, just to turn around and say fuck it when Asian Americans need our attention the most."
19,lsfur1,"I feel you, man, I feel you. I'll make this point, though. I have experienced more discrimination being an English speaking Korean living in Korea than any point in time in the U.S. I got bullied when I was 10-12 in Korea for not understanding Korean and grew to hate the everyday Korean man/woman. Nowadays, whatever, I'm too old (27) to be thinking about that stuff."
20,lsfur1,"We need to stop parroting this critical race theory of white supremacy. Yes, white people are racists, so are Hispanics and blacks. 

This blaming white supremacy by woke groups sounds like far-right groups in Europe that blame everything on Jews. 

It's not helping Asian American communities. We need to put ourselves first, not dismantling white supremacy ( whatever that means) and supporting other groups at the cost of our own."
21,lsfur1,"I understand your frustration but let’s not forget that systemic oppression is dealt by the ruling class. Other minorities are not at fault for the way we have been treated, historically and modernly. 

Division among minorities in the US is a tool of white supremacy.


Edit because the way I worded this sounds a little gaslight-y

I think that venting your frustration and anger is not only your right and your voice deserves to be heard, but it’s really important that we discuss these issues openly and bluntly. I just feel that the way that we articulate our frustration is extremely important, and that these kinds of discussions can easily become divisive without us even realizing it. I said what I said because we should keep these things in mind while having these discussions. Other minorities are our allies. We are imperfect individuals and so are they. But the root of our shared oppression comes from white supremacy, and we must remember our common goals in order to solve the problems we face."
22,lsfur1,[removed]
23,lsfur1,[removed]
24,lsfur1,"I think a lot of us are forgetting some key factors on this issue. A lot of the older generation are indeed racist, or at least go by stereotypes. I had to argue even with my own parents about this. They told me that I was right, that not all ""insert race"" people are like that, but most are. They won't budge.

Not only that, a lot of the older generation that I know of around Atlanta are profoundly ""Christian"" or think of themselves as such. 

If any real change is going to happen, it's going to have to be from the younger generations. Trying to get the older generation to really care is like talking to a brick wall. They're so set in their ways, that I doubt anything will change their minds. Not to mention the propaganda coming out of South Korean Youtubers that push stupid rhetoric of how BLM are just rioters, etc.

But I will say this though. I'm honestly tired of worrying about other minorities. Throughout the history of the United States, all minorities have bickered with each other and it's just exhausting. So now, I don't care if I'm the stereotypical model minority. If that's all these people have to say, then fine. I'll just enjoy my privilege(If you can even call it that) and live my life. Life is too short for me to squander it away, worrying about racism from other minorities. I've worked too hard to get to where I am to worry about it any longer."

1,qq8uy2,Hey what about Johnny tsunami
2,qq8uy2,"Lol. ITT: People who didn't read the main body of the post regarding MIXED RACE REPRESENTATION. Yes, we get it there are Asian/Asian couples. OP is referring to couples where ONLY the MOTHER is Asian, perpetuating the objectification of Asian women and the emasculation and marginalization of Asian men. You all in this thread listing off Asian/Asian couples is only confirming the problem OP is trying to address."
3,qq8uy2,"There’s a show my kids watch, “Alexa & Katie”, where the dad is Asian and mom is white. It was cool to see."
4,qq8uy2,"Simple, POC women are fetishized. Unfortunately not just an AA issue. It's always a white man + POC woman.

I saw a comment somewhere before pointing out how in most mixed race couples, one of them always has to be white (either a white woman or man). We need more diverse representation, like Asian/Asian (Asia is HUGE and DIVERSE, where are the Central Asian/East Asian couples, etc??), Latino/Asian, Black/Asian, Indigenous/Asian, etc."
5,qq8uy2,Agree. Positive portrayal of Asian men is always a problem. I have little faith that this will change soon.

8,qq8uy2,Yea pretty much a joke. If you only watch movies and shows. You would never know Asian men exist
9,qq8uy2,Something I noticed a couple years back is the lack of POC men in mixed race couples in the media whenever there's casting involved i.e. not real couples-- I noticed this initially in commercials but obviously it's an issue in TV shows and movies as well. I think it's gotten marginally better in the intervening years (although the poc man and white woman is still a rare sight) but now I can't help but notice interracial couples when I watch TV.

13,qq8uy2,"Yah, it’s a real problem in media, and has bugged me for years. Kim’s Convenience was such a breath of fresh air in that respect. There are a few others, but damn far and few between. 

Chloe Bennett has talked about the issue since her dad is Chinese-American and the face that Asian men rarely get romantic leads. 

I know this doesn’t address the lack of Asian leading men, but check out the Nat Geo Explorer series with Albert Lin. Chinese-American, scientist, and general bad-ass."

20,qq8uy2,"This needs to be approached objectively. So despite the title, you specifically mean Asian + non-Asian couples. So how about we compare the Asian male and female mixed couples:

**Male -**

* Big Hero 6
* Johnny Tsunami

**Female -**

* American Dragon
* Suite Life (London Tipton's dad, although he's pretty much non-existent)
* The Ghost and Molly Mcgee
* Agents of Shield - Daisy's dad

Feel free to add to this list."
21,qq8uy2,Mulan's dad.

*Tosses*

'Po from King Fu Panda has an Asian dad, specifically, Mr. ping, who is a single father. He adopted his son of a completely different species, raised him entirely by himself, and treats him precisely as he would his own. In the King Fu Panda animated Nickelodeon series we see that his father would also die for his child, and also takes on a struggling youth under his wing if given the chance. This clearly indicates that DreamWorks is clearly superior"""
23,qq8uy2,"Yeah that's true. On a sidenote, does anyone remember the 90s Cinderella movie? I swear it was a giant fever dream lol. If I recall, Prince Charming was played by a Filipino dude (yay), Moesha was Cinderella, Whitney Houston was the fairy godmother, and George Costanza was in it."

33,qq8uy2,Well there's Mulans dad... But I get ur point. Very little representation
34,qq8uy2,"Float has main characters that are a Filipino father & son… and every Filipino you meet is going to be mixed race to some degree because the Philippines are a chain of volcanic islands that rose out of the sea!!!

Like “native” Hawaiians, our distant ancestors had to have immigrated to the islands from elsewhere because we didn’t come out of the oceans and have gone through numerous generations of intermixing with whatever group took control of said islands.

Hell, the vast majority of us got Spanish last names for that very reason!"
35,qq8uy2,"Lilo's dad is dead.  Hiro's dad is also dead.


Parents are rare in tv shows.  That's how competitive being a dad is already.  Best to stick with lead or supporting roles...you know, the ones that don't encourage kids to go on adventures and possibly get killed.


But still, Id like to see an Asian dad too.  Hell I can't even think of an Asian mom and moms are more common."
36,qq8uy2,"Okay. What about Mulan? Her dad is definitely Chinese, yeah? Moana. Her dad is east Asian/Pacific Islander, right?"
37,qq8uy2,Since Marvel is Disney..we did get an asian dad now

42,qq8uy2,Looks like you have not watch a single second of Raya. Nor the Disney Pixar shorts. Dumb fuck
43,qq8uy2,"Mulan? That’s so old tho lol. I agree it’s interesting to observe and a problem, good Asian community representation especially of loving families is important to be seen as beyond the perpetual foreigner, especially in young children (who watch Disney) who may have fewer preconceptions of race…

Btw Do you think representation in TV and movies has gotten better than 10 years ago or so? I feel like it has improved *somewhat* and I am looking forward to even better representation in the future (at least I really hope it happens!)… on the other hand anti Asian sentiment is still pretty prevalent in the US and worldwide so time will tell."

I like Mrs Tran and the other laddy from crazy rich Asians but they are both ethnic East Asians ( Tran is Chiense Vietnamese ) nothing wrong with that just for  a  movie that supports south east asin reps it does a poor job"
0,ter3ja,"I think it makes sense to do what's best for your family. I don't know why you'd be called a coward for prioritizing safety. Like, do we need to get attacked and then decide to leave? Is it some kind of honor to ""survive"" NYC/other major cities that are experiencing this? All the best!!"
1,ter3ja,"I was planning to move to NYC from Chicago in the near future, with the expectation that anti-Asian violence in NYC was going to lessen over time.  It didn't, and it only seems to have increased, or at least become even more high-profile.  So I nixed those plans completely.

There aren't many reported anti-Asian hate crimes in Chicago, especially compared to NYC/SF, so I decided to stay in the city.  But I still moved to a safer neighborhood (hopefully) recently, because of a general uptick in crime.  I wouldn't fault anyone for moving away from NYC, or even from Chicago, because of current trends.

New Yorkers (and Chicagoans) are big into gaslighting anyone who complains about increases in crime or moves away from the city.  Part of it is chest-thumping/dick-stroking, but part of it is rationalizing their own decisions to stay... for now.  But most people have a limit, so if this trend continues, maybe in a couple years some of these douchebags will be asking you where the safer places are."
2,ter3ja,"I live in NYC also and while we are not yet moving it is sad that it is coming to this for many people.

NYC will always have a special place in my heart.  It is where my parents moved when they came to this country and built a life for our family  It is really sad to see what has happened the last few years.

The fact that every thread against Asians gets removed on reddit and is actively suppressed being talked about is frustrating when the impact to our community is so obvious."
3,ter3ja,"I think about leaving NYC every day because of this. The problem is, I grew up here and have family who will not leave, so I can’t leave them.

Good luck to you and your family. Do what’s best for you regardless of what other people say.

Here’s hoping the anti-Asian violence stops soon because I can’t take much more of the heartbreak and anger."
4,ter3ja,"Ive definitely been concerned. Had more anxiety about it earlier in the pandemic, but I'm a 30s male and 6ft. I know that doesn't make me immune, but even looking at those targeted it's largely older folks and women (which is fucked, but of course they're gonna target those who are they feel are weaker). 

While I personally have found comfort in that for my own safety, I 1000% get wanting to leave. Anyone saying you or your wife are cowards can fuck off. I do still get anxiety around it, but I can imagine it's much more especially for your wife. You and your wife deserve to live somewhere that you aren't in fear just walking around. Full support.

Edit: Also your wife's old workplace can fuck off, too."

2. Hawaii > NYC any day.
3. No amount of Museums/Chinatowns/Restaurants/Nightlife is worth your quality of life and mental heath."
9,ter3ja,[deleted]
10,ter3ja,I can't think of anything MORE American than leaving for a new land and a new opportunity.
11,ter3ja,I don’t blame you esp when there’s nothing really done to protect and defend us. Everyone is busy supporting Ukraine while our community is being terrorized. I’m looking into moving myself. This is just so fuckin heartbreaking and ridiculous.
12,ter3ja,"I moved about 6 months prior to the pandemic but visit every few months for orthodontic appointments. Prior to the pandemic, going to NYC Chinatown on weekends was fun. I could visit a Buddhist temple, get cakes from Tai Pan, boba from Yayas. Now I dread it, carrying pepper spray, and just stick to wall at Canal St while crying that the platforms less than 3 ft wide. (I would love to take an Uber but with Chinatown traffic I’m sure I would be waiting for it for half an hour while open to attacks.)"
13,ter3ja,"You are not in the minority regarding your thoughts here -- there is an uptick in violence in large urban cities (e.g. NYC, LA, SF, SEA, etc) and anyone who says otherwise is gaslighting you.

I fully support your decision, though I am sorry that you had to make it :/"
14,ter3ja,I have moved from the East Coast to the West Coast simply because Asians are more respected and represented over here in general.
15,ter3ja,You made a decision that you felt was best for your family. Good luck.
16,ter3ja,I was so paranoid about the attacks on our community that I fought with my elderly parents all the time to stay home and I would do all the shopping and such. And it's so heartbreaking because we've lived in our community (not in NY) for over 20 years and to no longer feel safe was so demoralizing especially during such an isolating pandemic. And people that we had known for years that we thought were our friends and we trusted turned out to be huge supporters of those who pushed anti asian hate rhetoric. My heart hurts for you and your wife. I wish you all the best ❤️
17,ter3ja,"Asian American here. Me and my family moved out to NJ from NYC. While I haven't experienced any hate crime, I feel like the quality of life has decreased mostly due to security. I feel comfortable doing late night walks where I live now. I can't imagine doing that in NYC anymore. I do not blame you for making decisions that are best for you and your family."
18,ter3ja,[removed]
19,ter3ja,honestly until NYC calms the fuck down I would say yeah get out of there. Same for SF.
20,ter3ja,"So sorry to hear about the stress you guys have experienced, particularly for your wife -- I constantly worry about the safety of my mother.

I am currently overseas but will have to return to the US soon, and I am concerned (more than before) about safety when picking a place to set roots.  It's hard enough finding a place to live where the the AAPI population isn't something like 4%."
21,ter3ja,"I want to say, don't let them win, but I 100% get the decision to leave. You're not a coward for looking out for your family. Michelle Go could've been packing pepper spray, and it wouldn't have helped. Christina Lee and 67yo woman could've been more alert, but why should they have to? It's all fucked up, and I'm just torn up about it."
22,ter3ja,"I use to live at Union square felt so safe tbh even 3am for 7 years but I also moved out of nyc 5 years ago. I can’t even imagine living there now where you are forced to take public transit. Here in Seattle it is also bad in terms of mentally Ill individuals, but we have a car. We barely go to those locations so it is completely different. 

My husband is also Asian American from Hawaii it is completely different than rest of USA . Kinda similar to Vancouver Canada in terms of how many Asians etc"
23,ter3ja,"I'm glad you're doing what's right for your family, the anxiety your wife is going through sounds truly awful.  I don't think you're cowardly, and moving ""home"" sounds absolutely lovely.  For me, NYC is my home, my family is here, and it's hard for me to leave because of that.  However things really concern me.  The violence, for sure, but also the rising costs of EVERYTHING. The really late stage corruption manifesting everywhere.  I'm not sure if, in a few years, I'll be right behind you...moving somewhere else.  We will see.

Maybe I am crazy.  I grew up here when things were not good, and you had to be constantly on alert.  Because of that, so far I feel like I can handle this, like it's familiar to me.  I still ride the subway at all times, while being a 5'2"" woman.  My parents hate that I'm doing that and always tell me to be careful.  It again reminds me of when I was a kid and all my friends who grew up with me always say ""get home safe"" and ""text me when you're home"" rather than ""bye"" (and legit wait for that text, and follow up if it doesn't arrive).  I'm debating with myself if this is all really okay, because I understand life can be better.  But I'm also hard pressed to think of other walking cities in the US to live in.  Maybe we move international.  I'm not sure yet.  For now, gonna hold down the fort here in NYC.  Good luck on your move and please don't have any guilt, you're going home!  That's a happy thing."
24,ter3ja,"Yeah, my husband and I left earlier this year -  due to racism (I've been wanting to leave for years, but after the Georgia shooting I was done with not only NYC, the country) and also due to him losing his visa (thnx trump!). It was a hard decision, our lives were in NYC, it is and was our home. I grew up in NJ/NYC and have my roots there, we were building a life there. We had the option of staying (being married and all) but we left. We were done. 

With more and more of these horrible things happening, I am so glad we left. We live in Berlin now. I've been here almost a year and have only dealt with one (barely) aggressive racist, basically some skinhead loser throwing a titty tantrum in the street.

Do what's best for you and your family. I know that everyday, even with a war bubbling like two countries over, I feel very lucky to have left.  I worry for my friends and family back home everyday, and the anger that this is happening in my home town grows and grows."
25,ter3ja,I hope you find a comfortable and safe new home
26,ter3ja,"> We know there are plenty of people out there who will judge us for this decision and call us cowards (we've already been called that and worse for even saying we're scared), but we're not regretting this decision.

Who is calling you this? I really hope it's not fellow Asian Americans."
27,ter3ja,following! i really wanted to move to NYC in the next year or so but with the recent increase in crimes i really find it difficult to justify anymore 😭 i was looking for a thread with accounts from asian womxn specifically and it looks like this is it
28,ter3ja,Best of luck to you in your relocation. I hope you find somewhere that suits you better.
29,ter3ja,"Come to Los Angeles. We have a huge supportive Asian community here in the 626 (San Gabriel Valley) which includes Monterey park, Alhambra, Arcadia, Rosemead and San Gabriel. When I’m in these areas I feel totally safe because it’s 99% Asian. I don’t blame you, and you’re not a coward. I am extremely paranoid as well as I live closer to the downtown area of Los Angeles. I carry a taser wherever I go and I avoid areas that aren’t more than 90% Asian. It’s too dangerous nowadays and risking it just isn’t clever or worth it. I applaud you for moving! It’s better for you and your wife’s mental health. If we can’t beat the violence, we might as well just avoid it.

When I go to the downtown area of Los Angeles I definitely get harassed verbally by virtually every person who walks past me when it reaches >8pm at night. It’s pretty scary, and the last time that happened to me I thought I would have died if I didn’t get into the Uber in time. In the Hollywood area, I definitely have gotten followed to the point that I needed to take my taser out to scare him off. Just personal experience, but my friends have had it a lot worse with homeless people swinging chairs at them on the street."
30,ter3ja,"I was happy to have moved pre-pandemic. Even before that I was getting comments, aggression etc from assholes, especially while taking the subway.
I was lucky in many ways because my family and I had the resources to move. But so many Asians, especially elders, do not.

I still love NYC but I'm sad at what it's become."
31,ter3ja,"You’re not cowards, go somewhere where you feel safe and happy"
32,ter3ja,I moved from NYC to Hawaii and it's surprising how it's flipped around here.
33,ter3ja,"Shame Asians are going to leave Chinatown and white people will take over and gentrify it. I bet if there are enough of them, then these jails/homeless shelters will start disappearing and be put somewhere else."
34,ter3ja,"Thanks for sharing, and I hope your decision can bring both some more peace and safety to your family. It certainly is not a cowardly decision. Everytime I read about an anti-asian hate crime in NYC I get chills down my spine, it frightens me how targeted our community is right now. I also had plans to move to NYC sometime this year for school but I have been rethinking my decision as ewll. Sending lots of love to your family."
35,ter3ja,"I don’t think you’re unreasonable or even a coward and even if you were who the fuck cares. You do you. And while I don’t take it lightly that there’s been many Asian victims, in a city of 11 million, I think it sounds like there’s more Asian hate crime than there actually is. I’ve personally haven’t had a single incident happen to me, given I’ve been working from home but it’s not like I stayed in every week either.

All in all, if safety is your concern, Hawaii is probably the best place to escape to where you won’t encounter the same problems. I can only wish you life and safety and hopefully one day this city will be cleaned up. 

I knew when the pandemic happened there would be lots of anti-Asian sentiment, but this surge will pass. Look at how Muslims are viewed post 9/11 and today, sure it never went away completely but it isn’t as bad as the years following 9/11."
36,ter3ja,"Thanks for sharing. While NYC is an amazing city, I would also prioritize family safety (both mental + physical) too. Do what is best for you and don't listen to others that are not supportive. Wish your family all the best."
37,ter3ja,"I left NYC summer of 2020 — saw the writing on the wall early and had some issues even before then with where I was living. Since then I’ve watched herald square / ktown really change in terms of safety and many of my asian friends have either moved to upper east / upper west or left entirely.

I’m in Seattle now which still has some issues but is way better than NYC. Asians are working towards becoming a solid voting block and I have hope that we’ll succeed.

Hawaii is an awesome place to return to! If my family wasnt Seattle based I would definitely head to Hawaii. It has to be the best place to live in the country for asians."
38,ter3ja,"I'm a bit of a mixed bag for NYC- always have been.

I feel like younger asians in the city grew up in a period of hilariously low crime. The city basically became disney world. Historically NYC has been rough. A lot of my older relatives- the moment they could afford to leave the city- they did. Even in the 2010s when NYC was squeaky clean they had a deep aversion to it from their past experiences.

TBH- the cost of housing and the influx of money into the city is only going to make things worse imo. NYC was already stupid expensive before the pandemic. Some how it is 50% even more expensive. 

It's just going to throw more people on the street and exacerbate the problem.

TBH I think the city itself is still for now historically safe. You just can't be the carefree kid you were 10 years ago. You could say the city is going back to its gritty roots where you kinda need to adopt a more callous sense of things. 

But unless your job only exists in the city- or you have deep family ties here, at this point I don't think the city is worth it. Plenty of other cities with growing asian populations where you aren't paying $4200 for a 1b1b and washing machine."
39,ter3ja,[removed]
40,ter3ja,"Do what you need to.

As a lifelong New Yorker, I understand your concerns.  I hope that this all blows over."
41,ter3ja,"it’s sucks bc you would expect less hate crimes in a diverse + urban place, but sadly racists are everywhere :( wishing y’all the best ❤️"
42,ter3ja,"Truly sad. My Black twin neighbors sold their house & moved to Jamaica to limit their attacks here they had by simply walking down the street. 

Good luck."
43,ter3ja,"My sister lives in Queens and she was almost assaulted by a deranged woman (a white woman) in the subway. My sister was just minding her business waiting for the train when this lady was directing racial asian slurs at my sis, she then started to charge towards her and some gentlemen stepped up and told her to fuck off if she goes near my sis again. I know this seems mild but it scared the shit outta her and myself - it's one thing hearing about crimes on paper/media, but it's a whole different feeling when it happens to you. 

She still considers NY to be her home, but she's been 10x more vigilant now since the pandemic started especially since she commutes everywhere. I live in Chicago and I have not heard much news about asian hate crimes here, but I definitely get the ""go back to your country you chink!"" or ""speak english you're in America!"". In my experience it has been mostly from black and white people who have said these things to me - it really sucks - and sometimes I want to stand up for myself on situations like that, but I don't want to get punched/robbed or killed, I would just brush it off because it's not worth my life over some stupid comment(s).

Anyway good on you and your wife for moving, if you don't feel safe in NY then moving is the best bet, fuck what everyone else thinks."
44,ter3ja,"Used to live in NYC, moved just before the pandemic for work reasons. When I visited again last year, the city was even more of a dump. I'm glad I don't live there anymore and encourage all my Asian friends to leave. The city clearly doesn't care about us, why should we stay?"
45,ter3ja,"Asian male here. I moved out of Chicago for the same reasons. The crime was becoming intolerable to the point where r/chicago was banning posts on crime since it was ruining the city's reputation. My job has become fully remote so the location didn't matter and I found myself wanting to get away from the city life as my hobbies don't really rely on it.

I moved with my white girlfriend to the suburbs of Boston and it's been great so far. It's quieter and there's no more fear of being out at night. I do miss the convenience of city life and lower cost of living but I don't miss hearing passer by getting hit by gunfire."
46,ter3ja,"I'm not in NYC but I am thinking about moving out of the US in general.  I think it's ridiculous that I have to consider getting a licensed carry, and even more ridiculous I would be inclined to use it if I was ever threatened in anyway. How the fuck is that any way to live day to day, like some kind of tweaker, looking behind your back every 15 seconds? Seriously, fuck this shit, fuck this country and fuck every motherfucker who is staring me down when I walk down the fucking street."
47,ter3ja,"wouldn't blame ya on why you are moving.  The reality is that you have limited options.

1) fight back (which is exhausting)

2) move

3) do nothing which has been a typical Asian move (I'm going to get downvoted for this but don't care).   

so curious where is ""home""?  is that better?

over the past years (I would say 5 ish), NYC has slowly been turning into a shit hole.  It just got worse over the past 2 years."
48,ter3ja,Hawaii also has a large homeless population as well. Are they not a major source of crime in hawaii or it is just city specific in Hawaii?
49,ter3ja,"It’s hard to think of what we need to do to protect ourselves and our elderly parents. We can’t be with our elders at all times to protect them. Do we teach them to fight and defend themselves? Carry weapons on them? Limit there movements in public? But then it’s like they don’t have a life anymore. So yes, one way is to just move away. Life is too short to fight back when you’ve got a lot to lose if you were to be hurt or killed. Only if you cannot move, then I would say yes, you have to learn to defend yourself and teach that to our parents."
50,ter3ja,"Canada has lots of Asian-centric suburbs if that's your thing. Just putting that out there for anyone who wants to consider. Nobody is that concerned with hate crimes here. At least it's not a daily existential threat.  

Despite what the internet dum dums say. It's not a bunch of empty houses owned by real estate investors. There are towns full of Asian families. That rhetoric probably comes from those who've never set foot in these places before."
51,ter3ja,"I don’t blame you at all. I’d rather be a “coward” and alive than stabbed 40 times or pushed in front of a train.

Are the Ukrainians that fled Ukraine cowards for leaving? No, they’re protecting themselves. The reality is there are people targeting Asians and it’s best to avoid them."
52,ter3ja,I'm so sorry to hear this. The anti-Asian racism in US is ridiculous and irrational. I hope you guys stay safe.
53,ter3ja,"This post is a bit alarming for me because it makes me think maybe I should be more worried. I’m also an Asian American (biologically female, 20) and my commute is an hour long from my home to my school and also my home to work (each way). At one point my commute was near two hours long one way. 

Ive been working (healthcare) since the beginning of the pandemic in NYC and 100% depend on the MTA since I don’t have the financial means to get a car. I have had my fair share of encountering racists and homeless people in the subway and on the bus but there’s honestly nothing I can do to change this. 

Nowadays, I just stand away from the edge of the tracks. Some of my friends have even longer commutes (from one outerborough to another) and they don’t carry any defense with them… maybe because they grew up here and don’t feel threatened?. 

I wish you and your wife all the best and I understand why you guys are moving. It’s scary stuff but for a student and healthcare worker like me there’s no realistic alternative. I’ll have to finish school here and continue to complete rotations around the NYC area. You guys leaving because of the crime definitely signals to me that this should all be taken a lot more seriously than it is right now. The violence is so traumatic and threatening that people are moving away. I never considered it to be that bad, but I guess it is. 

In SF (my hometown) , there’s a lot of anti Asian crime there too. I worry more about my grandparents. But I do think a lot about moving back after I graduate because at least I’ll have my own car and home… it will be more secure than in New York. Very sad times for our community."
54,ter3ja,"You should come to Montreal or Toronto! It's pretty close to NYC and even though there is hate, a lot less than the US"
55,ter3ja,It's fucking insane what's happening over there.
56,ter3ja,Yeah get out of there ASAP bro. Never liked that place. I got some shit that happens to me every time I visit back in the mid 2010s.
57,ter3ja,I don't think anti-Asian violence is limited to NYC.

The frequency of the attacks being reported on by the news has only increased my pre-existing paranoia of walking around in the city as a woman. Hope you’re wife is able to work through it with her therapist. Much love to you both 🧡
60,ter3ja,"You're not the only one braddah. I literally left the entire country (Europe). Can you update us when you decide where you guys are moving? I loved NYC pre-pandemic and was hoping to go back soon, but seeing these posts and the news... nope. Hope you guys find somewhere where you can call home (besides the 'Aina ofc)"
61,ter3ja,Everyone should do what is best for their family and their own mental health. But part of me does wonder what is going on in the sense that am I just oblivious to the fear I should be feeling?
62,ter3ja,"I love NYC and consider it my home, but I feel you. I’ve thought about leaving a lot over the past year, but my industry doesn’t really exist in most cities and I’m afraid the move would derail the trajectory of my career. I’m mostly worried for my mom and have been trying to convince her to move back to her home country without making it seem like I don’t want her here…"
63,ter3ja,"I left after living in NY for about 30 years and the pandemic with remote work provided the best excuse.   NY was already becoming too expensive and with all the shit going on, I said why bother.   Just picked my ass up and left."
64,ter3ja,"jeeeez, i didn't know this thing got serious, anyways i'm not sure you are doing the right thing, maybe it's just a mediatic thing and you two should just relax a bit, maybe let your wife realize there's no (more than usual) reason to worry about

btw, people calling you coward for that? dump that person!!!"

66,ter3ja,"My husband and I are both Hapa kine, met in Waikiki 17 years ago before moving around the US and Korea. We were living on Oahu for the last 4.5 years. Recently we moved to central Texas with our 2 small children. I would live in a studio apartment in Ewa if we could go back. Immediately upon returning to the mainland, I felt the low key racism I remembered from when I was a kid growing up in rural Minnesota. My 4 year old daughter had never experienced any kind of prejudice until we moved here and some nasty tween girls left the playground in a huff because they “didn’t want to get Covid.” It’s not even bad here compared to NYC and I would move back in a heartbeat. I wish you safe travels home. Aloha"
67,ter3ja,"Sad you have went through this.  It is not like this all over though, but I have never lived in NY so I can not comment on your situation.  Do some research and find a decent state or city, maybe a suburb and find a better quality of life.  However don't forget, Asians can and will be racist to other Asians as well.  So just because Asians live in an area, does not mean you will be welcome depending on where you are from or how ""Asian"" you are or are not.  May you find happiness."
68,ter3ja,Ehh idk.. I’m an Asian male and work in healthcare nearby.. I don’t get any “anti-asian” sentiment pre and post pandemic. neither does my asian gf.. I think y’all haven’t experienced real racism in the south and Midwest lol.

1,lo3pyl,Maybe it’s just Twitter but I feel like other minorities don’t care about us.
2,lo3pyl,"Great article. Really touches on the issues we've been witnessing for years and just recently. The amount that people downplay racial attacks and prejudice towards AsAms is disgusting. I'm sure plenty of us still remember the sheer number of people who said shit like, ""Now you know what racism feels like,"" or, ""Black people have it worse,"" as if we've never experienced racism and the attacks on our community don't matter. Unbelievably hypocritical to see those sentiments come from other people of color considering the increase in social and racial awareness in the last decade. AsAms clearly aren't part of that awareness."
3,lo3pyl,"Asian people, including infants and children, are being attacked and murdered all across the Western World. If someone tries to gaslight or downplay what is happening to Asians, don’t relent and say “okay”- shut *them* down. Our parents and our children are in constant danger of violence and death. Anyone who tries to downplay what is happening is trash.
Edit: also, the violence, which is occurring daily, never reaches the front page of the news, and never reaches the big talk shows. Only Trevor Noah brought it up briefly, as an afterthought. 

We are apparently not worthy of their greatness because we're statistically more likely to go to college than other minorities (/s), among other things. We are, according to most people, a hivemind, not worthy of empathy or consideration when we're being spat on and stabbed in the streets every day across the entire Western World. We're just robots, as so many people call us."
4,lo3pyl,"OMG, all of this article. 🙌 🙌 🙌

Sadly, I've seen almost all of those gaslighting comments here and other places online though surprisingly never in person. The ones that stand out the most are **""This is not the time to be talking about Asian-Americans…""** and **""Are you saying that Asians have had it worse than Black/Latinx communities?""** because I'm seeing a lot of it now with all of these attacks on Asians. 

They're hurtful because they're dismissing the pain that we're feeling, the struggles we're enduring, and making us feel like our concerns don't matter, that we aren't allowed to feel any type of way, or that we haven't paid our dues yet. I can recognize Asian American issues and still be a mindful POC, one doesn't necessarily take away from/damage the other. 

Personally, I try to remind myself that a lot of the noise that I read is from the internet where people can portray themselves off as anyone and that I have yet to experience anything like this in person. On one hand, it gives me hope that the crap I see online is from trolls. On the other hand, it's low key concerning that people really do feel like this and while they don't voice it in person, they feel empowered to voice it over the internet thanks to the anonymity it provides. 

I've never heard of the article's author, Jennifer Li, before but I'm a fan now!"
5,lo3pyl,"I agree with the article. That said ""trickle up antiracism"" probably does work. By that I mean, the structures that would need to be put in place/dismantled to address antiblackness are probably more than sufficient to also address anti-Asian hate

Obviously there are Asian experiences not shared by black ppl, xenophobia is a big one. That said, the tools we would use to fight asian oppression can still be found in the anti-anti-black toolkit

Maybe someone can think of something unique to our community that we need special tools to address. I'm open to that"
6,lo3pyl,"The overwhelming source of racial tension in the US is rooted in white supremacy. The stereotypes and propaganda that white America has created and spread to use Asian Americans as a shield against other minorities has been hugely effective in dividing those who would oppose white supremacy. 

Our allies in combating white supremacy aren't white people."
7,lo3pyl,"Yes, others downplay racial attacks against Asian Americans. However I can think of at least two celebrity cases where the Asian American involved downplayed a racial slur towards them as 'not a big deal'. This reaction has an impact on those who witness it. I have seen the exact same situation several times in an academic setting where others recommended to file a complaint but the victim in question just shrugs it off. Well those people are not going to stick their necks out and report it on behalf of someone who will just downplay the whole issue once it is looked into. And they likely won't care if it happens again because clearly the person involved doesn't bother. Now with covid racism Asians are slowly waking up perhaps."

11,lo3pyl,"There  are just multiple socio-political problems happening at once that  it's  hard to split it up into a simple socio-political solution.

The  overall most important issue to address is that these are despicable   acts being committed by young people to older defenseless people   unprovoked. There are tons of youtube videos where people of different   races fight and it doesn't really blow up. It will always be shocking to   see defenseless people get hurt regardless of race.

Race  will always be a thorny issue. The overall simplest thing to   understand is that overt racism (racial slurs, stereotyping, violence)   has overlap, but is different than power. Anyone can be racist towards   each other. People who identify as White can be racist against Black   people, and certainly Black people can also be discriminatory towards   Whites, Asians and anyone else. The difference about talking about   individual prejudice and recognizing patterns at a larger societal level   is power.

Power and racism often  get conflated, but let's separate the two out for  a moment. Power at a  societal level means having your views and  opinions represented  through government, corporations, media and a few  other avenues. Many  conservatives know this inherently when you consider  the electoral  college. The electoral college was created as a power  balancing  mechanism so that larger cities and larger stats don't  overrule the  smaller and more rural communities. The same thing happens  with race.  The cultural values and opinions of people who identify as  White are  much more widely represented in government, corporations and  media. We  have predominately White identifying politicians, CEOs and  media  moguls. With regards to power the general see higher  concentrations of  White people at the top, then Asians, Hispanics, then  Black people.  From there we see almost the same patterns throughout with  income, home  ownership, life expectancy.

Critical  Race Theory is the first theory I've seen that adequately addresses the  issue of race and power.  They have found patterns between historical  issues, such as banks and realtors redlining, racially segregating  communities and that affected the worth of the homes.  Wealth is passed  down from generation to generation and many in the White community are  passed down money, homes, and businesses from previous generations,  where as many in the Black community do not.

From  Critical Race theory has branched out another theory called Afro  pessimism. They basically examine and look at how anti-black  racism  became a world wide phenomenon because slaves were exported all  over  the world and were at the bottom of the social structure globally.  This  has led to a lot of inner turbulence amongst social justice circles  to  call out other communities of color for their anti-black attitudes  and  racism.

Much of the conflicts  that arise amongst Asians and Blacks are that the  US has stereotyped  Asians as the ""model minority"" that Black people and  other ethnic  groups to look up to. Many Asians own businesses in Black  communities,  which is good and bad. They will service the community that  many ethnic  groups don't want to service, but often don't hire Black  people to  work in their stores or businesses, making many in the Black  community  feel taken advantage of. The thing is the model minority myth  is that  it creates competition amongst ethnic groups, erases the  experience of  Asian immigrants who come from poorer backgrounds, and is  based on a  false premise pulling themselves up by their bootstraps. Most  of the  successful Asian minorities come from rich families in Asia.  China has  over a billion people. Of course the most competitive  applicants to  come to the US for citizenship and colleges and  universities are from  more well to do families.

What's  been a struggle in the anti-racist movement is that in the 80s  and 90s  there was a more multicultural alliance to end racism. However  many of  those ties have been lost amongst younger generations. If you  look at  our country by zip code and race you would see we are more  segregated  than we were in the 1960s. Many Black, Asian, White, Hispanic  people,  etc. don't come into contact with each other on a day to day  basis and  mostly learn about each other through the TV. Many of groups  go through  their struggles alone. So many of the recent movements have  been  focused on people only championing their issues and their  communities.  Recent anti-racism movements such as Black Lives Matter  view the world  through an anti-black lens, where they recognize the  Black community as  a whole has the least amount of power, however they  conflate that with  overly racist acts. So they call out overt anti-Black  racism (slurs,  killing) as the worst racism, but conflate it with the  issue of power  (representation in government, media, etc.)

Thus  I think they need to switch that thinking around. Push for more  power  (representation in government, media, etc.) and call out all  racism  against Black, Asian, Hispanic, etc. I think this would help out a  lot  more with alliances and trying to give more people in society   opportunities.

I think the  anti-racist community shouldn't gaslight Asian Americans when they are  the ones getting attacked.  I think those in the anti-racist movement  shouldn't gaslight White supremacy and MAGA when it's not White  people  or MAGA supporters committing these acts. Basically anybody can  participate in anti-Asian discrimination and shouldn't be given a pass.   Everyone should just be standing together against anti-Asian  discrimination when it comes to these acts.  On the other side  people  shouldn't use this an opportunity to keep beating up the black  community. The average person isn't overtly racist and the average Black  person isn't a thug beating up old Asian people. These kids represent  themselves and anyone and everyone should be saying more to shun these  kids without having it become a racial stereotype.

As  far as Afro pessimism goes. I overall agree with the findings and   theories, but don’t think the activist approaches with this theory have  helped their causes. It tends to alienate anti-racist allies and isolate   black activists to just themselves. For me it’s more simple. I’m for   working with whoever is against racism and against those who are for it."
12,lo3pyl,"I don't see gaslighting happening here. What i do see happening is that white supremacy/capitalism are expertly dividing us once again. We cannot demand Black American support for Asian American issues. That's not how it works, especially when we are rewarded with conditional whiteness for oppressing Black people (e.g. Peter Liang). I don't think we have to be quiet about our issues at all, but the article seems to explicitly demand *Black* recognition for AsAm struggles when they certainly don't get our unified recognition for theirs."

I was never taught Tagalog (Filipino) and I’ve only gone to the Phils when I was 10 which was nearly 20 years ago.

And I do identify culturally and ethnically as Filipino, there are many times I ask myself “am I really Filipino?” Or “How Filipino Am I Really?” 

There are many times where I also question if perhaps part of my “Filipino-ness” is broken or being broken sometimes and then other times when I totally can feel like “oh yeah, without a doubt, I’m Filipino.”

2,c4a696,"Since a few of you have asked what the meaning behind this piece is, here is the copy + pasted caption from my instagram where I originally posted it:

""I created this piece after having a conversation about the strange and unique identity of being half-Asian with one of my friends who is half-Chinese but white-passing. As someone who usually comes across as fully Asian, we are on opposite sides of the spectrum, and yet neither of us are accepted by our respective communities. My white features and inability to speak Japanese are enough for some Japanese people to turn their nose up at me, and his attempts to be closer to Chinese culture and learn Cantonese are perceived as overcompensation-- as trying to convince the world he really is Asian despite his looks. Both of us are trying to reclaim something that should have been a birthright and at the same time internally rejecting the parts of ourselves that others say we should not identify with. In the end, who cares what anyone thinks?"""

8,ma6fhc,"I'm staying open minded on this. My current take is that the killings were first and foremost misogynistic, anti-women. As Asian Americans, we then recognize that misogyny hurts Asian women in a unique way (e.g. the hypersexualization mentioned in the OP)

If these murders are to be seen as anti-Asian, it should be because misogyny itself is anti-Asian. It means that our cause and the feminist cause are intimately linked

This. 

I don’t think the shooter was racist* but he most definitely allowed his underlying perceptions of Asians, particularly Asian females, to perpetuate his actions.

*I don’t think racism is as black/white as society makes it to be but is nuanced. Check out the Implicit bias test below -

Also, most of the victims are over 50 and 60, not the most likely to be sex workers.

17,h00qf6,"This article didn't cover the whole thing. Not trying to defend Wahlberg because his crimes were not acceptable by any means, but it's been over 30 years since his hate crimes. He may have changed. Here's a different point of view: https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/mark-wahlberg-racist-hate-crimes-wikipedia-history-george-floyd-blm-protests-a9554191.html"
18,h00qf6,"Johnny Trinh, the man Wahlberg thought he blinded when he attacked him as a teen said back in 2014: 

“He was young and reckless but I forgive him now,” said Trinh, who did not know his assailant wound up a famous movie star. 

“Everyone deserves another chance. I would like to see him get a pardon. He should not have the crime hanging over him any longer.  He paid for his crime when he went to prison. 

I am not saying that it did not hurt when he punched me in the face, but it was a long time ago. He has grown up now. I am sure he has his own family and is a responsible man.” 


If the man Wahlberg viciously beat while yelling racial slurs can forgive Wahlberg, why can’t we? He isn’t the same 16 year old kid he was back then and he’s been very open about his past deeds. Doesn’t he deserve another chance before everyone just decides to cancel him?

Edit: I should add that I don’t condone his actions. What he did was awful, and I’m glad he went to jail (albeit briefly) for it. It just seems like folks are out for blood and I don’t see the sense behind it. Unpopular opinion, I know, but I felt the need to share a different perspective."
19,h00qf6,"I’m going to be the voice of dissent here. This happened 30 years ago when he was a teen. From what I remember, he ran with a rough crew of troublemakers and got into trouble with the law a number of times. 

Of course this is repugnant but 1) he was younger and 2) this was nearly 30 years ago. Many people make mistakes during their teen years that they later regret. People mature and can change. If we want to hold him responsible for all the wrong that he’s done, would you all do the same for George Floyd, a convicted criminal?

Secondly, many of you may not even have been alive 30 years ago. I was. I grew up with minorities around but casual racism was a lot more accepted then. It was common to be called “chink” and “slant eyes” even though there were many Asians where I grew up. Even teachers would make casually racist jokes. That doesn’t exempt this behavior but it may help you understand that society’s bar for what it accepts changes over time. For example, back then gay people were considered abnormal by the mainstream. Now their acceptance is part of the mainstream. 

If Wahlberg, has had a clean record since then, then I’d considered him reformed. He’s worked in Hollywood for some time, alongside people of color. I imagine this is one of the things he regrets the most. I hope that we don’t go down a path where people are branded with their mistakes for all time because everybody deserves an opportunity to reform."

0,u25m3b,"Yikes, I did kinda cringe at the cheating fantasy jokes but now it's ""too real""."
1,u25m3b,"Dang, that's unfortunate. While I do hope she continues making that conscious effort(because it's seriously groundbreaking compared to others who put down their heritage just for gags), I do wish the best for both of them."
2,u25m3b,Sad but also knew it was coming after her last act was low-key shitting on her marriage. I feel like every time a comedian does that a divorce isn't far behind (though of course there are exceptions like John Mulaney that just spring it out of nowhere lol).
3,u25m3b,Hopw the kids get lots of support. They are so young.
4,u25m3b,I love Ali and how they seem to be fun couple. I was hoping to find a similar relationship. I didn't like all the talk of cheating in her last special. I guess now is her chance to live out those fantasies :(
5,u25m3b,Saw them eating with their kids at Jin Fong on the upper west side in NYC a few months ago. Sad to hear
6,u25m3b,"Wow, now her act looks really cringey. It's kinda funny when you think they are joking, but now her last act seems really unfunny."
7,u25m3b,"It definitely wasn’t a good sign that most of her third standup special was about wanting to cheat on her husband. 

I saw Hasan Minhaj’s comedy show last winter (soon to be taped for his second special) and he didn’t make any jokes about wanting to sleep with other people despite being way more famous than he was when he made his first special."
8,u25m3b,That’s such a bummer. I hadn’t gotten around to watching her latest special yet but after all these comments maybe I’ll just skip it.
9,u25m3b,Tbh I don’t see how any husband can watch what she said in her latest special and feel ok with it. Maybe the marriage was already in tatters by then
10,u25m3b,"I'm so sad about this news! Mostly for selfish reasons, but I was hoping she and her husband would or already had work/worked something out creatively or decide to be poly --or already were, but not open, or not open yet. Or something! Like a lot of folks have said, I thought her openness was a great indication of relationship health. 

But wow -- I guess I was under the impression that all of us married folks have these thoughts, and that they are not serious, and that she was just speaking them out loud -- but that ultimately that they are harmless and do not bode poorly on a marriage. 

But now I feel that called into question for myself... Now I'm worried about my own relationship health due to having similar thoughts to what she expressed in her specials, particularly Don Wong! It makes me wonder if independence/escape and also cheating fantasies are NOT normal, then, in folks who will ultimately happily stay together? 

I always felt in my case, the little fantasies were imaginary temporary mental escape and reminder to self that I'm choosing to be in my current situation --which can be wonderful --though there are always going to be compromise and shifting/negotiating communication... but my fantasies are very brief and occur in moments of frustration, and serve as a reminder that we can always choose another way if genuinely unhappy. No one is stuck and we're both choosing to be here and can choose not to be, or we can be flexible about each other's needs and helping each other understand each other. 

I felt for me it was more a healthy coping device to reduce stress in a moment and better communicate later ""striking when the iron is cold"" instead of hot or too emotional/ triggered. 

In other words, I thought of the fantasies Ali Wong expressed and that I related to (and assumed everyone did) were just Mental fun, a very small breather from reality. Kind of like when your boss makes you mad and you imagine quitting and telling them off but don't ever intend to actually do it and don't actually literally do it. 

And I know intellectually that Ali Wong's other circumstances are very different from mine, so I know rationally I shouldn't equate this news to ""we're doomed."" But I still am in my feels and doing that. So now I'm trying to get it to sink in that my circumstances are totally different. I don't have money or power or respect (respect in greater society anyway), for example. Or any of a million other circumstances I don't and never will know about her life. 

But I did notice that part in Don Wong where her face GLOWS with what feels to me like actual happiness and pride and self-assuredness and surrealness -- and maybe also longing. like her inner essence (or spirit or life force energy or soul or whatever you call it) just grew way too big in all things good and present and true, to even fit all the way into her body anymore when she says, ""...I KNOW I can make it on my own."" 🥺🤗  In that moment, I did really want that for her and just anyone to have what they know will make them happy. ❤️ 

(But the news itself still otherwise makes me so sad, lol.)"
11,u25m3b,I guess no more sashimi on a Tuesday for him.
12,u25m3b,It is unfortunate but I guess I know exactly what the next special will be about. I really enjoyed the pervious one about babies and being a mom. I watched it after I gave birth and was doing night feeding it was funny. The recent one was interesting 🤔 I did watch it with my husband lol and the cheating special lol 😂
13,u25m3b,I just read her book and the afterword is her husband writing a letter to their daughters..... I feel so bad for their kids.
14,u25m3b,I guess that last special makes sense.
15,u25m3b,">actually made a conscious effort to portray Asian masculinity in a positive light

Though her last special was a lot of her telling the world how badly she wanted to cheat on her husband. Kind of uncomfortable to watch - felt like watching a relationship fall apart on stage

Yes, I get that there's a double standard between men and women celebrities, but IMO the solution shouldn't be expecting less of women, but expecting more of men"
16,u25m3b,"This may sound weird, but while Ali Wong's humor isn't really my style, I am still glad she's out there because I think it's good to show an Asian woman being raunchy and ""unclassy."" She helped break down a bunch of stereotypes: that Asian girls can't be funny, that they are all prim and reserved, that they are all shy and introverted, etc.

Just to be clear -- nothing wrong with being introverted or reserved! I'm certainly an introvert myself. I just mean you shouldn't *have* to be that way if you don't want, and Ali Wong helps break down those barriers."
17,u25m3b,This is really sad. I feel for their kids. Hoping the best for both parties.
18,u25m3b,"I think she did a remarkable job holding Asian men as desirable and sexy, even despite all
the jokes about wanting to cheat in the last special. I guess it’ll be news whatever/whoever she decides to get with next. Part of me will be bummed if she just goes for some white dude after the praise she gave to Asian men, but honestly it’s her choice and she doesn’t owe it to anyone to not do her own thing. 


I thought the part in the last special about how she much she wants to be dominated and specifically told racist shit during sex was kinda wack tho. I know there’s a fetish for everything but I mean is that common??"
19,u25m3b,"no ones gonna mention her soon to be ex husband is dr fad's son?  i can hear the theme song in my head. im blown away by this detail.

i didnt see her last comedy stand up special, but no where in the article stated she cheated on him so is it fair to just automatically assume that?  from the comments here it seems her comedy special was pretty damning/foretelling but not everything said on stage should be taken at face value.  especially in comedy.

i dunno, it just seems like a waste of everyone's time assuming that and also hurtful to the family whether cheating is or isnt the case."
20,u25m3b,"This is a very common phenomenon in the celebrity world. If a non-celebrity marries someone in show business before they get famous, they usually end up divorcing after their partner hits it big. 

Once you're a celebrity, even a D-list one, you will have access to a much wider and more attractive selection of potential partners. Applies to both genders so I'm not singling out Ali Wong for this. 

There aren't many celebrities that have stayed with their non-celeb spouses after they got famous. It's common for celebrities after they get famous to date normal people as long as they are extremly hot."
21,u25m3b,Iam sure her next BF is white dude.
22,u25m3b,"I saw her show live and if I remember correctly she talked about the cheating for most of the show - even more than she did in the Netflix special. The show I saw and the actual taping were a couple years apart due to the pandemic, so I'm not surprised if her material shifted a bit by then. Disappointing but not surprising. But damn, the next special is going to be an interesting one!"
23,u25m3b,It’s got to be hard on the relationship when ur act has a lot of it in the act
24,u25m3b,"It'll be an interesting case study in a year to see if Asian Americans treat celebrity indiscretions more like Asians or more like Americans.

I remember reading about how Hyolyn from Sistar had to come out and apologize for being insufficiently enthusiastic at one of her fan meet and greet events.

Versus Justin Beiber, who maintained his popularity despite spitting on and otherwise mistreating his fans."
25,u25m3b,"Male celebrities do this all the time. Nobody should be surprised. They get famous, divorce, shortly after are spotted with another celebrity."
26,u25m3b,"She just deleted most of her IG , Keanu still made the cut"
27,u25m3b,"she was asked to sign a prenup by her mother-in-law before marriage in case she wants to take advantage of him once they divorced. Now, apparently she is more successful and thanks to that prenup, she keeps most of her property."
28,u25m3b,"Watching her recent special, I kept waiting for the punchline about the cheating on her husband…. and it never came, until the announcement of the divorce. That was the punchline… she’s kidding, but actually not kidding at all and now she’ll get all that sexy time with different men. Sounds like she wasn’t happy in her marriage and here’s the outcome."
29,u25m3b,Saw this a mile away
30,u25m3b,"Damn Ali, now we don’t know if you were joking or not. Can’t support someone who has an ego and branch swings as soon as things go good for them."
31,u25m3b,I really felt Ali Wing’s first big special was such a major moment for comedy because it was just so incredibly funny the entire way through. Her last special was so disappointing and listening to her describe how she wanted to cheat on her husband again and again just felt really sad.
32,u25m3b,"Honestly her second and last special was terrible. I couldn’t finish the last one. She lost it.

She was just talking about sex all the time. Not to say it can’t be funny but there was nothing clever about it. It’s just basically her being loud and trying to create shock value."
33,u25m3b,He bought low and sold high
34,u25m3b,"To be fair, I saw her live a few years ago, and her act at that time was the same as the newest Netflix special. It seems more like a poorly timed coincidence."
35,u25m3b,"Given her last special, I think she’s going to progressively undo most of the messaging from her previous standups."
36,u25m3b,Why do i feel like the next news i see of her is she's with another celeb white dude? Feels like this happened to another celeb couple that I liked before too.
37,u25m3b,Not a surprise. Just spend five minutes on her last Netflix special. All she talks about is cheating. Pretty cringe.
38,u25m3b,"I feel for the kids. Divorce alone is hard.
 
I wouldn't even know what emotions I'd have, seeing one of your parents being a public figure and talking at length about wanting to cheat."
39,u25m3b,Good for him. Imagine being married to a woman who makes a living talking shit about you on stage.
40,u25m3b,She seemed really resentful in the last standup. Now we get why
41,u25m3b,"A lot of the stuff I’ve seen of her lately is just her hating her marriage, something about cheating, and hating being a mother. It became really clear to me that these weren’t just “haha so funny but my irl life is great” it was more like “let me be open with the audience but make it sound funny”. Sad stuff man."
42,u25m3b,Sad news but I hope they can stay friends and be good co-parents
43,u25m3b,Grown folks are making the decisions that are best for them. Any sympathy we might have for her husband's mind state should be countered by the fact that she's going to have to share the NFLX money.
44,u25m3b,L
45,u25m3b,Guess we can expect to see her with Michael B Jordan next
46,u25m3b,[removed]
47,u25m3b,Saw her in San Francisco right before the pandemic started. I think she said that her husband was working the merchandise table.

0,miw2z2,">The way things are set up allows for these random pitch fork mobs to appear(like it has now), because of peoples deep seated hatred of asians. It is now okay for these closeted racists to go after asians.

It's cyclical. This is why it's important to bring up the duality between Yellow Peril and Model Minority dynamics when discussing the pressures that the Asian American community faces. Asian communities, like other marginalized communities, become convenient scapegoats for economic and moral issues of the time.

When Asian Americans, first Chinese laborers and then other ethnicities, first started immigrating, it kicked off the Yellow Peril hysteria. There was mass hysteria about Asian men being a threat to White women, Asians out to steal everyone's jobs, Asians as plague bearers, etc. Places like San Francisco had a [slew of anti-Chinese city codes](http://libraryweb.uchastings.edu/library/research/special-collections/wong-kim-ark/laws3.htm) aimed at making business and Chinese cultural behaviors heavily penalized, and [Chinatowns across the country](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=11825013) experienced mass purges and massacres.

Attention moved to other ethnic groups for a while (see: racism against Mexican Americans), but WW2 and Japanese imperial aggression presented an opportunity [for people to capitalize on the economic gains that Japanese farming families](https://wou.edu/history/files/2015/08/Jared-Quinones.pdf) had made in California. [White farmers in California](https://fee.org/articles/special-interests-and-the-internment-of-japanese-americans-during-world-war-ii/) especially lobbied for interment and profited off of Japanese families who lost everything.

After WW2 we had the Red Scare, with Chinatowns across the country being [terrorized by the FBI](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/mccarthy-numbed-with-fear-chinese-americans/) and random civilians being placed under surveillance for doing mundane things like being part of Chinese community groups.

Then we had the domination of the Japanese auto industry in the 80s which led to the same kind of xenophobia and [racist resentment about Japan](https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/06/us/resentment-of-japanese-is-growing-poll-shows.html) ""taking over"" that we see happening nowadays towards Chinese manufacturing. Again, lots of openly racist rhetoric and the Vincent Chin murder being a direct result of this.

And of course we know well the past 20 years and current situation with COVID. Racism and overt violence against Asian Americans isn't anything new, but our communities are and this is what makes it so difficult because each new immigration wave brings with it a new generation of people who have to relearn this history and try to connect with one another."
1,miw2z2,"Doesn't really add to your point, but your wording just reminded me of how Japan managed to blame the great Kanto earthquake on Koreans which lead to mass lynching and slaughter of Korean residents in Japan. Countries blaming foreigners for natural disasters is as old as time."
2,miw2z2,"I’m just gonna say it. I think there’s a lot of deep rooted generational trauma between the different nationalities that keeps us separated. Do I agree with it? Absolutely not, but I think that’s why there’s division within our Asian American community as a whole. My Halmoni lived through the Japanese occupation, and she still does not trust Japanese people and won’t associate with them. My dad’s generation is better, but there’s still distrust there. I don’t have issues with people from other nationalities, but I’ve had other Asians be shitty with me because I’m Korean. 

I agree with you 100% that we need to unify our community as a whole. We need to realize and recognize that we ALL face the same hate, racism, and issues and work together for a solution."
3,miw2z2,"I agree. Asians have always been maligned and for the most part, we've been ok since, broadly speaking, we kept our heads down, ignored the haters, and did what was needed to move upward. But this time it's different since COVID has given boldness to racists to verbally and now even physically assault us in supposed retaliation for our race for essentially robbing the world of millions of people and countless more of their previous quality of life. I can't say that I don't understand where they're coming from, but that (obviously, perhaps, since racists rarely seem to bother with specifics) they are targeting all East Asians, not just Chinese. I fear that this might lead to a kind of distancing within the East Asian community itself if Japanese/Koreans etc start to close themselves off from the Chinese community.

I think the best thing to do is to call racists out, to them know that there are consequences to being a racist. Tbh, I don't know how a unified Asian front will help much, except maybe to make sure that the police are doing their job in apprehending culprits. It's not like the racists *actually* believe that the Chinese and specifically that person that they are assaulting knowingly made the virus and there's an organization needed to stop that misinformation; they're just using it as an excuse to vent their anger on them. I think it's different from BLM in which there were protests to modify laws since there in that case, the changing of laws actually affected the treatment of blacks."

5,miw2z2,"Sadly  Texas GOP Congressional candidate Sery Kim, a member of Trump's 2016 transition team who was appointed to the Small Business Administration as an assistant administrator by Donald Trump has bashed Chinese Americans. In an interview with a Dallas based newspaper, she alleged that Covid was created in a Wuhan lab and that Chinese brought this virus to the United States. Her comments were disavowed by two Korean-American representatives from California. They also withdrew their endorsements of Ms. Kim after she declined to apologize.

Ms. Kim has since deflected her statements by claiming that her remarks were addressed at the Chinese government and not Chinese American immigrants."
6,miw2z2,"There are few things we need to change from this:

1. Be more vocal and united. This is without question the key to combat future oppressions. Raise our voice. Learn from other minority groups. Stop being **model minorites**, aka goodie two shoes. Be cultural warriors if we have to. Look at how the media tiptoe around African Americans, because they are not afraid of raising their voice when shit comes. 

2. Stand up for other groups. Look, I know too many of us just want to put our heads down and live our lives. Some even wish to become honorary whites. Guess what? Being a teachers pet has the exact effect of alienating everyone else. And if we want to get support from other groups in times of needs, **we should support others in their times of needs.** Social capitals need to be built up over time. Stop being in separate silos."
7,miw2z2,"I think painting all non-Asians with the same broad brush is the wrong approach here.  Let's be honest, almost all of te anti-Asian bigotry is coming from the same circle of bitter losers who have been emboldened by four years of Trump.

These men began hitting on Claire and her friends. In an effort to get them to stop, the ladies told them that Michael was their mutual boyfriend. However, the men continued to bother them.

One of the unidentified men then asked Michael how he was able to score all of these ladies. He answered: ""Just be yourself and they’ll come to you."" The teens then walked away from the men.

1,ol25b3,"You must be somewhere with more diversity. Where i grew up and live, there’s too few asians to throw each other under the bus. No one can tell us apart here anyway."
2,ol25b3,[deleted]
3,ol25b3,"Agreed. One time a Filipino sales rep who was having lunch with me found out my father is Chinese and my mom is white and he had the gumption to ask me what my mom thought of my dad's small dick size. I just said, ""WHAT DID YOU JUST FUCKING SAY!?!"" And lunch was over pretty soon after that. But him seriously thinking I'd be ok with that was an eye opener."
4,ol25b3,"The hatred against Chinese-Americans that I've seen from fellow Vietnamese Americans (INCLUDING one of my coworkers!) in my area is so ridiculous. Like my VietAm coworker has strong prejudice against a Chinese American coworker because she has roots from mainland China whereas with coworkers with Taiwanese or Hong Kong roots, she considers them the ""good"" ones and I'm just like WTF."
5,ol25b3,"Yep, understand that feeling. 

Don't like it that Hongkongers call mainlanders locust when I identify as both a Hongkonger and Chinese. 

Also got called a Chinaman in Chinatown by a Vietnamese man. I was debating if it was a slur or he really didn't know any better. 

Then there is this strange tension between the Chinese Vietnamese community and the Vietnamese community. Why is it that they are so similar but so apart??? Onetime a Hoa gave my uncle a thumbs up for marrying a Vietnamese woman and I'm like WTF. Then I spoke to my Vietnamese friend about Hoas and she starts talking about them negatively when she knows I'm Chinese?!? 

Like a lot of first and second generation Americans, the tensions from the old world still lingers on in America even without its historical context. Eventually when faced with the pressures of living in the west, Asians will form bonds over shared experiences here. Just like how my poly sci professor talked about how his Indian mom would say, you see those Filipinos and Mexicans, they are just like us, working hard just to make it in this country. 

By the 3rd and 4th generation, they might probably forget their roots and adopt a general Asian American or just American identity. 

Not an optimistic point, but that's what I was taught in my political science's race and politics class lolz."
6,ol25b3,"This is amusing because a lot of Hoas just consider themselves culturally Vietnamese, and many of them also do not like to associate with China. However, the sentiment towards Hoas is partly due to the mass migration of southern Chinese during China’s cultural revolution, many of them fled to Vietnam during the French-colonial era where Vietnamese natives were unable to control any portion of the market, whereas the French allowed the Chinese to do so and therefore Vietnam associated the Chinese with being ironically “capitalistic/bourgeoisie,” which led to the persecution of the bourgeoisie (in which was thought to actually persecute the Chinese, although wealthy Vietnamese weren’t spared either) during Vietnam’s own cultural revolution."
7,ol25b3,"No shit.  This reminds me of the time a Taiwanese Facebook friend posted something about Chinese people.  She used the word ""支那贱畜"".  She was very educated and had a PhD in STEM.  This really made me question humanity."
8,ol25b3,"It’s pretty funny when other Asians attack us because honestly, non-Asians can’t tell us apart. Yesterday, the head of the Olympic committee was in Japan and he called them “Chinese”, which really pissed off the Japanese. And on Fox News, some commentators said Japan was committing Uyghur genocide. All the time that non-Chinese Asians spend thinking they’re better than us is completely moot."
9,ol25b3,"There has never been a strong sense of community or solidarity among Asian Americans. 

But there is plenty of conflict, name calling, hostility etc among all Asian ethnic groups."
10,ol25b3,"As a fellow Chinese American I share your experience and sentiment. I've noticed that no particular group really seems to back Chinese Americans, or even Asian Americans in general. Until a proper social movement comes along I suspect we'll kinda just have to deal with the racist junk and go on with being dismissed. Plus I doubt we'll get any reputation points from good behavior on behalf of the Chinese government so unless we can form a stronger sense of community and instill motivation for social reform like we've seen with the African American community, we'll probably just remain punching bags for everyone. I've got a ton to say on the subject of Chinese/Asian Americans and social justice and such but honestly I don't have the energy for an essay right now, so props to you."
11,ol25b3,"Based on my experience, there is no solidarity with Asian Americans and there will never be. Chinese Americans are its own group. Korean Americans are its own group. Filipino Americans are its own group. Etc. We, as Asian Americans will never be a united group like African Americans. Why? Because each of us, or more correctly, each of our parent came here with their own culture, with their background and upbringing, and their memories of their country. African Americans came on slave ships and they build their current culture and identity as African Americans. African Americans in America have almost nothing in common in terms of culture or language or shared identity with Africans in Africa except the color of their skin. Us, Asian Americans, we are children of two cultures, we adopted identities of our cultures and also that of America. But each of our parent came from different areas of Asia, had different culture, and had different reasons for coming to America. And as a result, we are very different from each other. 

And as /r/fitforprint said, there’s a lot of history amongst the different Asian groups."
12,ol25b3,"As a Japanese immigrant whose community is a formerly pan-Asian Chinatown (people just kept being run out for city projects to chop pieces off it because we’re not anyone people care about. We were being gentrified in the ‘60s) seriously, I don’t get this “don’t attack me because I’m not Chinese!” That’s LDP garbage. 

I see you. I get you. It’s not OK."
13,ol25b3,"I'm Japanese American and I will stand by my all my Asian brothers, sisters, and non-binary siblings no matter what. So I have your back.

However, I'm also biracial so even though my support won't waver against any anti Chinese racism, I know quite a few monoracial Asians who don't give two shits about people like me supporting them or being a part of the community, even if we are born in Asian countries and have closer ties to our homeland than some monoracial Asian Americans do. This extends past racist subreddits like ""A\*nIdentity"" but is something I've personally experienced my entire life.

I know this is something deep that extends past your rant and I do not expect you or anyone here to have a solution, but I also feel this keeps being swept under the rug, particularly right now."

15,ol25b3,"Too much divisiveness, what we need is solidarity. Not just Asian solidarity, but with everyone."
16,ol25b3,"i agree with this post, chinese itself is super diverse and lots of people (even other asians) forget that. there are many different languages, ethnic groups, sub ethnic groups, and sub cultures within china and the chinese diaspora is also very diverse and grouping them together (like I see some people in this thread doing) is very silly."
17,ol25b3,[deleted]
18,ol25b3,Don't let behaviors of a few bad apples lead you to conclude that its the behavior of all Asian Americans. Sorry to hear about your experience. Best way is to be better than them and know that the majority of Asian Americans have a united front against all types of racism.
19,ol25b3,You right
20,ol25b3,"I agree with the sentiment of your post, but as a Chinese-American, in my opinion, we can't ask for solidarity from other Asians when many older/more recent immigrants in our community don't even see Koreans, Japanese, SE Asians, or even Taiwanese/HKers as their own. Chinese communities, especially on the two coasts, can be very insular and mainlanders will generally look out only for other mainlanders, if not actively racist towards other Asians. Just as it's unfair to say that *every* non-Chinese Asian hates Chinese, it's unfair to say that every, or even a majority of Chinese people stick up for non-Chinese Asians when they're in a tight spot. In fact, [during WW2](https://rarehistoricalphotos.com/chinese-americans-during-ww2-1941/), many Chinese-Americans actively identified as not Japanese-American (China and Japan were at war, so this is understandable, but it could have been an very strong statement if the community had mobilized in solidarity). The Chinese American community likewise (for the most part) stayed silent during Sa-i-gu and when our Muslim and South Asian friends were targeted after 9/11. Solidarity is not built from nothing. 

We need to look inwards to make changes in our community first before we ask things of others. I have hope that these things will change, as the children of the most recent wave of immigration from the mainland born in this country start to have more shared experiences with other Asian Americans, and recognize our common heritage and struggles."
21,ol25b3,I’m a part of the problem. I’m a Taiwanese/American hapa. I’ve lived in the US and Taiwan as an adult and I am very much on the side of HK/Taiwan or any other Chinese group at odds with the CCP. I don’t wish for things to be harder for you. It should be known that Chinese Americans are not associated with the CCP. This isn’t made clear in most discussion. Ethnically I’m 50% Chinese so we have some commonality there.
22,ol25b3,"I live in Hong Kong and China is absolutely screwing us and taking away our rights. Taiwanese have similar fears. So no I will not boot lick the ccp or be an apologist for their atrocities, BUT of course I am totally against any kind of hatred against Asian Americans regardless of ancestry.

Also I am totally against HKers and Taiwanese propagating hatred against mainlanders. We need mainland people on our side too, but CCP is really good at ensuring they stay asleep and doing a divide and conquer. The CCP thrives from the culture clash between HKers/Taiwanese and mainland people. There is however a sub culture of mainland people who absolutely hate the ccp."
23,ol25b3,"I'm trying my best not to try to invalidate your experiences, but I don't think your experiences are universal. Even as a Chinese American person, I see a lot more hostility from Chinese Americans towards other Asian Americans than the other way around. I can remember a dozen hurtful stereotypes that I've repeatedly heard from Chinese Americans regarding Korean/Vietnamese/Filipino/Thai culture, and probably the most hateful things about the Japanese. 

And then there's the whole ""East Asians always forget to include South Asians when talking about Asian American issues"" thing that pops up frequently.

So OP I'm not saying you're wrong. Just chiming in to say that a little bit more empathy might go a long way at re-framing the issue as a broad, multilateral solidarity problem, rather than a directional hostility against only people like yourself. Because if there is directionality, I'd argue the imbalance actually goes the other way."
24,ol25b3,"Unpopular opinion:

I'm Southeast Asian and I've never had any expectation that Chinese people would stand up for my communities. I think expecting other Asians to stand up for you is kind of a uniquely Chinese thing.

The biggest Chinese American activism events of the past 10 years have been things like protesting affirmative action and defending Peter Liang, a cop who was negligent and killed an innocent black man.

Frankly, those are things that I have no interest in supporting.

On the flip side, I've *very rarely* seen any Chinese people give a shit about Filipino nurses dying of COVID or Vietnamese refugees being deported by the Trump administration, police brutality among Hmong youth in the Midwest, etc. 

To some extent, it feels like a lot of Chinese American Redditors are a bit entitled. A sentiment I regularly see bounced around Reddit is that Chinese issues are the most important ones, that pan-Asian solidarity with China at the center is the only way for Asians to thrive, that if you don't care about affirmative action or other pet Chinese-centric issues then you're fundamentally self-hating even if you're not Chinese. And Chinese people telling HKers and Taiwanese that they're all part of Big Daddy China definitely doesn't help either.

Again, as a Southeast Asian, I'm very used to being ignored and de-centered. But solidarity is great! So if you want more solidarity, I think a great start is to be the change you want to see, and show interest in all kinds of Asian issues, including ones typically overlooked."
25,ol25b3,[deleted]
26,ol25b3,You might want to look into your own community first because Chinese-Americans and Chinese immigrants are some of the most insular groups I know and often look down on other asian groups as well. You can’t ask for something your own community doesn’t demonstrate. So making some distinction about your own group not getting enough support seems a bit selfish or myopic. We all need to be more supportive but also recognize the flaws in our own communities.
27,ol25b3,"I've been called nigger of the Asian race many times by light skin asians. Koreans love looking down on dark Asians. Chinese ppl seem to only want money. Like my wallet is  more real to you than I am as a person. The only Japanese ppl I know are on playstation. But they probably would have treated me no different than the Viet and Hmong. 

 I grew up labeling most of you no different from the white and black racist here in America. 

Do you northern Asians see us? It seems like Asia stops at the southern most border of China. 

I know what it's like to get ganged up and jumped on. Spit on and have dirt thrown in my eyes. But there was no sympathy. I had to fight back. You all need to fight back or they'll just continue to bully you.

There are a lot a wedges that need to be removed before we can have solidarity. It hurt my heart seeing elders attacked. I saw my elders, my parents in those victims. I can put our differences aside. If someone was too get hurt in front of me, I'm jumping in to help. Regardless of race."
28,ol25b3,"Personally in real life and on Reddit Chinese Americans are the only ones who question whether South Asians or Filipinos are ""real asians"". I have Chinese friends say that to my face. I have read and heard South Asian Americans get similar questions about their asianness. On this space non Chinese users don't get a lot of traffic on submissions or questions.  

Also the fact you don't seem to understand how other Asians and Asian countries see China historically and presently really explains a lot about this rant."

If you are a “Chinese-American” that is perfectly well integrated with America you should drop the hyphen and refer and think of yourself as American. And when people challenge you on this as they invariably will, you challenge them right back. Americans of various ethnic descents need to see each other as Americans instead of seeing each other as carrying the sins of all of their ancestors. 

Then, as an American, you turn around and support the challenges of older immigrants."

You may live in the land of the free, but that's sure as hell no excuse to hold those hateful sentiments.

5,c6gk52,"Here's a summary article of all the times that MSNBC has clipped Andrew Yang:  
[https://heavy.com/news/2019/06/yang-mic-muted-debate-msnbc](https://heavy.com/news/2019/06/yang-mic-muted-debate-msnbc/)  


It's not just at the debate."
6,c6gk52,"Say something? As important as that moment was, screw being polite, I'd be raising hell during a break."
7,c6gk52,"I believe that Yang's Mic was off but I'm a bit more skeptical if this was an active tactic against Yang. The debate that happened yesterday had technical malfunctions and add on to the fact that big events often have technical problems especially with the huge amount of participants in this debate. Assuming its an innocent mistake, him not having the mic working while everyone else is would make it difficult for Yang to flag down someone or someone in the technical staff to notice and fix it. 

This is a bit cynical but if his mic wasn't working he should've made a bigger deal out of it rather than just taking it. I didn't notice his mic wasn't working and assumed he just didnt have much to add. Regardless of the reality or facts, thats a terrible optic to give and a Presidential candidate should not be passive about it. Sanders and Biden wouldn't have, they'd make every effort to flag someone and make it known of the problem. edit: Forgot to add that the fact that this info was only revealed through Periscope is very concerning for me as a Yang supporter."
8,c6gk52,"As somebody who’s produce live broadcast tv and reality TV series.   It’s most likely that a sound engineer issue.   Equipment, settings, slow to mute/unmute etc.   in this type of production, sound I think is the hardest part to do right.  Basically, you have at least 12 mics, that can pick up a lot background noise, or gain feedback noise.   Then add in the live broadcast (vs prerecorded) aspect to it.   It’s hard, even for pros.  I think it was on the Colbert show, they were making fun of Rachel Maddows and Todd talking to the producer/sound team and the joke bit was talking about ‘what’s for dinner?’.

I’m not a sound engineer, but as a producer, I think what most likely happen was that they were having mic issues, and may had to rely on manually mute/unmute.   Sound guys hands were probably simply more in ready position for Harris, Biden and who ever was talking more often.   Andrew Yang, unfortunately didn’t insert his presence more often or bigger visually... and he was often missed or it was too late to switch him in time.

Production people tend to be pretty liberal and from diverse ethnic backgrounds.  So I would give them benefit of the doubt, that there isn’t a tinfoil hat conspiracy but simply that doing the audio engineering is hard.

I love Andrew Yang, think he’s great in 1 on 1 talk show formats.   But the multi candidate live National TV; he’s just inexperienced.  Whereas Biden and Harris are going to be much more experienced."
9,c6gk52,this makes more sense. He could have recovered from his first question earlier.
10,c6gk52,[removed]
11,c6gk52,"This seems like a convenient excuse for him falling flat today. You're telling me in a crucial, 2-hour event WITH COMMERCIAL BREAKS, Yang couldn't flag someone down to get his mic fixed?"
12,c6gk52,"Sorry, but you don't need a conspiracy theory to explain Yang's poor performance last night. If Maryanne Williamson can get her two cents in, anyone can. It's clear that debate is just not his format."
13,c6gk52,"He should've yelled then. If a man has something to say, say it. I dont buy it.

If his mic was forcefully muted why didn't he raise that concern during advertising? He had a chance to get it fixed. He was absent and you could tell just by his body language"
14,c6gk52,I mean there's no proof and if they did do that it would be so easy to notice that attempting to do that would be stupid

For one thing, I know that many other Asian and non-Asian celebrities have been outspoken about violence against Asian Americans during the pandemic.

How did you/the creator come to choose those individuals as those wiht ""a significant following"" to target? Personally, I've never heard of @linglingherroo or @seonkyounglongest.

Why are [CBS](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/anti-asian-american-hate-incidents-up-racism/), [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/10/opinions/how-to-fight-bias-against-asian-americans-covid-19-liu/index.html), and [NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/asian-americans-face-dual-challenges-surging-unemployment-racism-n1235356) the target outlets?

[NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/us/chinese-coronavirus-racist-attacks.html)? Local papers? It should be noted that these outlets have reported on the spike in hate crimes, as I've linked.

0,dyz816,"Statements like this from Asian-America role models are important for healthy, integrative identity. Twitter is not the best place for nuanced conversation, but this at least opens the door to conversation, basically says, *it's okay, I get that you felt forced to make some choices, but you don't have to do that anymore.*

I'm older than most in this sub, grew up in white places before Asian-American identity was evident in popular culture (as /u/cricket_monster wrote it was in activist circles since the 60's). So while I wasn't consciously running away from Asianness, in hindsight that's exactly what I did because whiteness was the social default available to me.

As a 1st gen immigrant, I was in touch with Asian culture through family life and Chinese language movies and TV, but the result was that I was presented with only two ways of being:  

1--How to be an Asian person in Asian society  
2--How to be a white person in white society

The only depictions I had of Asians in white society were as outsiders. Since I didn't want to be an outsider (no young person does), the only avenue was to be like a white person.

It has taken decades for me to move past that dichotomy and develop:  
  
3--an integrative identity as an Asian-American person living in a multicultural society.

I'm still working on it. It's a life long process. And as the older generations die, it becomes more and more of a challenge for me and my cousins to maintain strong Asian cultural ties, even as the positive representation of AA identity have opened up.

But I'm glad young Asian-American people now might be able to skip through some of the bullshit of the old days or at least work through it more consciously."
1,dyz816,"It's an old tweet and an even older sentiment. Asian American activists and media figures have been saying this since the 60s. I mean African Americans have been dealing with these same questions about identity for the past like 300 years and there's still no consensus.

None of what Simu Liu tweeted is radical but perhaps the perception that it's somehow a new or novel idea points to what's wrong in the first place. We've been reckoning with this for a long time but I also think people have been going about it the completely wrong way.

I'm a big proponent of keeping in touch with the old country but I also believe that constantly gazing back can be just as stifling to the formation of Asian American identity as completely assimilating into white culture. I have always said that Asian Americans are born from two worlds but are orphans of both.

Everyone's always asking what Asian American identity is but I think the real question is what Asian American identity *should* be, because I don't think Asian American identity exists yet. We have a vaguely shared history, certainly shared interests, and shared obstacles, but we don't have any common cultural touch points besides the taboos and expectations that are found in literally any group of immigrants, whether they're Cambodian or Guyanese or Polish. That sounds depressing but it's actually pretty exciting. We're part of the first few generations that will get to craft the pan-ethnic culture that will be passed down to our grandchildren.

Also, I've met a lot of Asian Americans, and I haven't met many who are ""running away"" from their Asianness. What I do see frequently is Asian Americans who just don't think about these things or Asian Americans who are really, really overcompensating because they grew up in very white towns or they're married to white people.

As /u/unkle said, everyone has their own path."
2,dyz816,"I think it’s beautiful, honestly— we all know how tricky identity is to navigate and it’s important to take it at your own pace and respect the journey of others. You get to your destination when you get there, and we all get to different places in slightly different ways. And that’s ok."
3,dyz816,"I once ran away from my Asianess and proudly called myself an American only, no Asian in me. Fortunately, I've come to realize that was wrong and since then I've embraced my heritage and have been learning the language. This tweet made me reflect on my past self and made me proud of how I've grown."
4,dyz816,"Loving yourself and your identity is one part of your EQ journey. I have met a lot of first gen Asian Americans that refuse to speak their native tongue and so they've lost it. Their parents struggle with English to talk to them or function in their day to day, and the children just sit there. It's weird. All of my siblings have been translators for our parents, we take great pride in our culture. It's so strange to me to see someone who doesn't do the same."
5,dyz816,"I feel like this is more geared towards 1st generation immigrants who are still treading their lines of identity. Eventually the future generations of Asian-Americans will have less and less of a connection with their mother country, and languages will be lost as well.

I’m a 5th gen American and even my grandparents hardly speak Japanese and don’t know much about Japan. They were forced to “run away” from their Asianness because none of them wanted to embrace being Japanese after the war. I’ve made an effort to reconnect with my heritage though and have visited Japan a few times already. I imagine it would be blurry in the future when people mix even more, whether it’s between different Asian ethnicities or with other groups. You’d end up having people who are 1/4 Chinese, 1/4 Filipino, 1/4 Korean, 1/4 European or something like that.  Asian Hawaiians are a good example of that. It’s harder to keep in touch with your heritage when people become mixed down the road....unless you’re as homogenous as my family and only married ethnic Japanese people lol"

11,dyz816,"What about those of us who are first and foremost Americans? 

Personally, I’m proud to be Hmong but I’m also extremely proud to be an American and I identify as such above all else. Is that now a problem?"
12,dyz816,"there is for sure self-hatred installed into asians who grow up in america or just western countries. the default is white people and without even realizing it, you are taught to view non-asian bodies as beautiful while everyone else is an ~exotic choice~

that being said, just because you were rejected by an asian woman DOES NOT MEAN that woman in particular has some kind of weird self-hatred. for example, being labeled as ""not liking asian men"" because i rejected a friend in college.. who already had a girlfriend... and i had a big crush on his roommate (japanese dude)..."
13,dyz816,Why do I identify with this so damn much
14,dyz816,"I like his sentiment but it’s a bit of a dog whistle for the MRAsian crowd. The problem is, I don’t know if there are any ways to bring up this legitimate topic (for Asians of all gender identifiers) without causing ugliness on the internet, since the fringes are always loudest."
15,dyz816,"I dislike vague subtweets. I like Simu and the fact he is portraying Shang Chi. This feels like some shit somebody would say in college. I remember running the AAPI club on campus and we got an angry call from a parent because someone was trying to force their child to join our club. I learned quickly that while people might look AAPI, their relationship with Asianness is their own journey. Confronting people with ""truth bombs"" or edgy words doesn't really accomplish much if they are not ready. Looking back on my own childhood, I grew up among other Filipinos and went to parties and other gatherings. To me Asianness isn't a something to be explored, but already part of my identity as an adult. My advice is that you can't control people's actions and you're better off accepting folks because trying to proselytize seems off putting. If you're comfortable in your own heritage, that's more appealing and people might delve into their own culture if you don't ram it down their throat."

27,mu0p68,"From the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shang-Chi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings):

By December 2018, Marvel had fast-tracked development of a Shang-Chi film with the intent of making it their first film with an Asian lead. Marvel hired Chinese-American writer David Callaham to write the screenplay, and began looking at Asian and Asian-American filmmakers to potentially direct the film. The studios' goal was to explore ""Asian and Asian-American themes, crafted by Asian and Asian-American filmmakers"", as they had done for African and African-American culture with Black Panther earlier in 2018.[20] Development of the film also came following the success of the film Crazy Rich Asians, also released earlier in 2018, which led to several other Asian-led properties being developed by Hollywood studios.[21] Callaham's script was expected to modernize elements of the character's comic book story, which was first written in the 1970s, to avoid what modern audiences would consider to be negative stereotypes.[20] Richard Newby of The Hollywood Reporter said the film could ""break out in a way similar to Black Panther"" by bringing a new perspective to the character. Newby felt Shang-Chi could have worked well as a television series, and said it ""speaks volumes"" that Marvel would decide to make a feature film about the character instead. Newby concluded that the film is an opportunity to avoid stereotypes about Asian martial artists and be ""more than Marvel's Bruce Lee"".[22]"

But I can't help but feel that Asians are easily dismissed by every other race and that this makes it feel more like a lonely fight. Only Asians alone would help Asians. 
I've seen Asians put yellow peril for black lives signs up.. and support black lives matter in their way but I don't think I'll ever see any kind of reciprocation. 
I wish more Americans jumped on the bandwagon but I think at this time, if I were the average white person, I'd think ""yeah that sucks! I didn't know it was so bad!"" Then move on with my life.

We're trying though, and that's what matters right?"

>Around the same time, the Asian Lesbian and Gay Alliance (ALGA) conducted an  
informal study of various S.F. gay bars. One of the organizers later recalled, “White guys  
could sail through with no restrictions, but once color was added to the mix, the barriers  
went up.” The Midnight Sun and Castro Station were Castro bars particularly notable for  
their anti-Asian discriminatory practices. When confronted, the owners rationalized their  
multiple ID policies by claiming that it was difficult to visually discern Asian men’s age.  
ALGA picketed the Midnight Sun, attracting media coverage with placards such as  
“Discrimination in the Gay Community Demeans Us All.” During a KPFA radio debate,  
one participant recalled a bar owner claiming, “Your people don’t drink,” and “It’s a  
cruise bar; we would lose other clientele because they don’t want to cruise your type.”"

I'm mixed white/Chinese, but I know plenty of black/Asian mixes (including members of my own extended family), and they are no more or less Asian than I am.

Also, *hapa* is a Hawaiian word that simply means ""half"".  In Hawai'i it is commonly used for mixed people who are of any mix, regardless of percentages.  It certainly isn't limited to white/Asian mixes.

Also, r/mixedrace.  I think pretty much everyone on that sub has experienced what you've just described, and will commiserate."
1,mp561k,"For what it's worth, I'm full Asian (Chinese) and I've been there. Don't fit in to America because I'm not white, don't fit into Japan (lived there for a few years) or China because that's not my culture. And being Asian or Chinese American is not like this monolithic thing where we can all relate to each other and sing kumbaya around the campfire- I mean, maybe they're doing it somewhere right now, but nobody invited me. Ha.

What's helped me is realizing that at the end of the day, I'm the only one who has to live with myself. You have to have or develop a strong sense of self identity and self worth because there's no group you neatly fit into. It's honestly lonely but it might help if you find other folks with similar backgrounds who can relate. Be proud of who you are and don't apologize for claiming your heritage. People can also tell you you're a purple unicorn but they're just idiots spouting nonsense. You do you.

Another thing is to realize with most or all of these negative interactions you've had, that's them projecting their issues on you and it's their problem, not yours- I'm grateful when it happens, because in a way, they're saving you the trouble of figuring out if they're worth your time. If someone is giving you shit for saying you're proud of one heritage, maybe they need to get over their own complex or be a good ambassador instead of projecting on you. And hey, maybe you can feel sorry for those superficial people who won't even give you a chance, but that's their loss. You sound like good people.

2,mp561k,"I am so sorry that you've had this experience.

I'm ethnic Chinese and I'm a 3rd generation U.S. citizen, though I'm a first generation ABC (American born Chinese). Since my father was a medical officer in the U.S. military service, I've never lived anywhere in the States that had a large Asian population. I'm barely old enough to remember the old Jim Crow laws of the deep south. I remember when the first McDonald's opened in Atlanta, Georgia. My father was wearing his class A uniform having picked our family up from work. Although McDonald's was happy to sell us burgers, fries, and shakes; when we went to sit down, the manager came out from behind the counter to inform us that seating was for whites only.

I've spent most of my life feeling as though I'm a 2nd class citizen. Since I was raised as an American so as to better assimilate, I was never taught Chinese. This created problems for me when I visited Hong Kong (while it was still a British colony) because I was a ""cultural turncoat."" The only reason I know this was because while shopkeepers smiled at me, they were saying things like this behind my back. As to how I came to learn all of this, it happened that I had been joined by a white friend who lived in Hong Kong and spoke both Cantonese and Mandarin.

Due to his Anglo ethnicity, the shopkeepers assumed he couldn't speak Chinese. When they realized that I couldn't either, they began insulting me to my face thinking that neither of us would understand them. They were mortified when my friend told them that they were being rude.

When I was in kindergarten, I woke up one morning to find my father painting over words that had been painted in red over our garage door. The words read, ""CH--NKS GO HOME."" I was too young to understand the first word. I sounded out the other two and asked my father why anyone wanted us to go back to California. My Dad sidestepped the question and reminded me that it was Saturday and that I could watch cartoons.

Last year on my 60th birthday, I was at a doctor's office for a first visit. The office manager was an older white lady in her 70's. She called me over to the reception desk because she said there was a problem with my name.  She told me that I couldn't possibly be the person I had written on the check-in sheet because my first name was David which didn't match my family name which was Asian.

I showed her my ID.

She shook her head. ""You don't understand,"" she said. ""'David' is a white American name and you're Asian. You're supposed to have an Asian name.""

I looked at her as though she was insane. Was she serious disrespecting my name and making this racist comment?

""Your parents must have been horribly ignorant to not have known that Asians ought to have Asian names.""

My father was a doctor. My mother was a university English lit professor. They were not ignorant.

I thought about saying something but my parents raised me to not rock the proverbial boat. I was taught to walk with my head down and to not make eye contact. I was taught not to respond to racist provocations.

I fumed after I went home and finally decided that after 60 years, enough was frigging enough. I wrote a letter to the doctor and explained that I would be cancelling all future visits. I told him about what had happened and said that I wasn't comfortable being in the same room with a white supremacist.

I hand delivered this letter to the office the next day. The office manager opened and read my letter. I know she did this because within one minute of delivery, my cell phone rang. The office manager left an angry tirade on my voice mail. She claimed that she had NOTHING to apologize for. She claimed that I had inconvenienced her because now she had to cancel my next appointment. She alleged that if any of us were racist, it was me. She then said, ""Bless you!"" but in a tone that clearly indicated anything but.

I am reasonably certain that in her capacity as the office manager, she filed my letter in the trash and that the doctor never saw it.

I subsequently went on-line and filed a Civil Rights violation complaint with the State Attorney General's office. Someone called to interview me as to what had happened. Since I was on medical leave from my school district, had waited two weeks for this appointment, and would now have to wait for two weeks for another appointment, I was able to make a case for financial damage.

My complaint was accepted and was forwarded to an investigator for a follow up.

I received a written reply from the State Attorney General's office about a month ago. I also received a letter from the doctor's office where this incident occurred. Since I tend to be nonconfrontational, I regret to say that I have not yet opened either letter.

Racism is a terrible thing. I think this concept may be difficult for some whites to understand since most of them have never experienced it. Although I wish that things could be otherwise, the reality is that this is the world we live in.

On the brighter side, not everyone is racist. Your mother clearly didn't have issues with your father otherwise you would never have been conceived.

On the subject of whites and racism, I will also tell you that since my father was a tropical disease specialist, he was detached on TDY (tour of duty) when the first group of Peace Corp Volunteers went to Ghana, Africa in 1962. My father took my mother and yours truly along as dependents.

Although it has never been the practice to send government doctors out into the field with Peace Corp volunteers (unless the doctors WERE Peace Corp volunteers), John F. Kennedy ordered a tropical disease specialist to be detached on TDY with this first group since it wouldn't have done the PCV any good if their volunteers had gotten sick and died from tropical diseases.

The volunteers were all idealists and they were all white. They were scattered among rural villages outside the capitol, Accra. My father tells me that many of these villagers had never seen a white person before. Some of these volunteers had their first experience with racism when the tribal people coated their skins with white dust from the ground and openly mocked them.

One of my father's duties as a medical officer was to visit the PCV for health and wellness checks. At times he had to hold crying volunteers and to comfort and reassure them that everything would be fine.

I grew up with racism. These volunteers did not. I would imagine that the experience was emotionally traumatic for them."
3,mp561k,"I've struggled with similar identity issues. I'm Japanese and native American and white. I grew up in Japan and there was a lot of the ""not being enough"" while there, and then coming to the US and the same thing repeating itself. 

As I've gotten older, I've just gotten so unshakably confident in who I am. I've also stopped referring to myself as ""half"" or ""hapa"" because I realized in a subconscious way it literally made me believe that I was ""half"" of a human being. I'm also very selective about the people I surround myself with. Any kind of racism doesn't fly with me, and since I'm really solid in who I am now, less people seem to even dare say things to me that they might've in the past. And if they do I just have absolutely zero fucks to give. 

I don't know if that's helpful or not. But I guess for me, what's really helped is to completely stop listening to all of the noise from other people and listen to and trust myself. I know who I am. As mixed people we often have to pave our own way which can be tough, but I also feel like it can be such a privilege and a celebration once you fully embrace it in whatever way you decide to."
4,mp561k,"I’m so sorry - it’s a terrible feeling when you can’t feel accepted by the cultures that make up your identity. 

Honestly, I know that this isn’t easy to do. But, as you mature and move around the world - you’ll find your niche of people who accept you no matter what. That’s a very blasé “afterschool special” way to put it, but it’s your best bet.

Many times it feels like you can only pick one side to embrace to please them, because they will always place you on a pedestal. It really sucks. Also, I recommend to unfriend and block the people that aren't willing to empathize and understand you at all. It hurts a lot in the beginning, but it'll help your mental health greatly. I've had to do it for the past few years, because I realized that they were never going to stop being prejudiced towards mixed race people. Anyway, I just want to mention that I hear you, and if you ever feel like you're not heard, I'll listen. You can count me as a friend if you want."
6,mp561k,"I'm mixed Jewish, White, and Korean so my experience differs a bit but I've had most of the same stuff happen with the white and Asian bits. I'm proud of both sides of my history (for reference the white side is Scottish and Welsh) and I'm used to taking shit for one reason or another. But I can't say it isn't draining, especially with my mother basically being a borderline white supremacist who tries to be polite about it (the stories I could tell). Probably because I'm third generation but I do still see myself as Asian American even if I don't identify much with my ethnicities cultural stuff much being aside from a few dishes and wanting to get a Hanbok (not for cultural reasons or anything, I saw one as a kid once and have thought they were the most beautiful dresses I've seen since). Hell I know far more Chinese and Japanese history than Korean (it's interesting and I had a spare elective). Anyways my point is I'm sorry you gotta go through that, you're not alone even if the details are different."
7,mp561k,"Hey, mixed Asian here too. I just wanted to say that sometimes being mixed is in fact very hard and lonely. We exist in a world that wants to easily categorize itself and instincts that want to seek safety in a tribe. But for people like us, maybe that’s impossible. My identity crisis got triggered real bad from Asian hate crimes and sometimes i wonder if that’s appropriate because I have a lot of privilege being fair skinned but i think it’s important to remember that being othered especially in times like this is in fact painful and sometimes scary. And given the focus on Black and Asian relations right now I imagine that is even another layer of stress rn. t’s ok to feel anger, sadness and loss and even confusion. 

Like after I had a literal breakdown the other week from all the confusion I experienced I’ve been questioning if there’s a mental health idk “crisis” for the mixed community going unnoticed just from all the shit internalized. The rejection, constant erasure, pressure to be a “bridge”, pressure to choose a side, racism, mixed fetishizing, ongoing identity crisis (just normal life transition identity crisis can cause depression and anxiety so Id imagine a racial one would too), our identities defined and erased how we’re perceived as if we’re objects, narratives that we’re a product and perpetuating cultural assimilation and genocide, etc etc 

I’ve come to the conclusion that we have to be strong and sure for ourselves. We can’t let anyone define us or gatekeep us from our heritages. We have to rely on our own validation and navigate our internal sense of self. Sometimes I’m afraid this looks really lonely but maybe that’s just something to accept. 

I recommend looking up @mixedmentalhealth so far that’s the only resource I found that focuses on us. Also if you’re into affirmations here’s some specific for us http://www.mixedremixed.org/10-essential-affirmations-for-biracial-and-mixed-race-people/ Also this post is validating https://www.instagram.com/p/CM_KNgln0BN/?igshid=141t4b1ds4qb1 And I recommend checking out @ryanalexh who’s blasian and talks a lot on black and Asian relations and Blasian Narratives a DocuTheatre on YouTube"

10,mp561k,"FWIW, I also have similar identity struggles, albeit not as hard as yours. 

I’m ABC, born and raised in the Bay Area and grew up in a town that was mostly Asian. There is a weird subculture of Asian people in the bay who have kind of isolated themselves from other POC because they believe themselves to be superior to other ethnicities. And a lot of these kids grew up second gen and upper middle class and their parents never really exposed them to other cultures because of the heavy emphasis on education and being a “good Asian kid”. Most of these kids end up growing up pretty sheltered from the rest of the world and with the narrow world-views their parents have endowed them with. These are usually also the type of people to only call out injustices when something anti-Asian is afoot and buy into the white adjacency/model minority myth. 

I never really bought into that whole worldview (which caused a lot of drama between me and my parents) and have been lucky enough to surround myself with friends who recognize that the world is bigger than just the bay and appreciate all the different cultures we have access to here. But this has always kind of alienated me from other Asian kids, who have now grown up into the current Asian American culture of “boba life”, “rave life”, and “yappie life”. In a weird way, I’m not Asian enough for the Asian Americans here. 

All this to say (and as previous commenters have said before), the issue is not you OP. It is the people who are projecting their own issues and close-mindedness onto you. You are japanese. You are Asian. You are black. All of this is you. There is no threshold you have to meet in order to be Asian, that’s ridiculous. You have Asian experiences. Claim your heritage because it is YOUR heritage. I think you are unbelievably strong. I can’t imagine how it must be to deal with intense race issues back to back in a time where it’s already stressful. On top of that, you’re a woman! We women are strong and powerful, don’t ever forget that. Be an advocate for yourself OP :) We will always welcome you here.

edit: added “buy into” before white adjacency/model minority"
11,mp561k,"I had a buddy who had a similar experience. His dad was black and mom was asian. I remember he begun hanging around me because the other asians would tell him that he wasn't really asian amd that he was more black. I just didn't give a shit about that. In fact I feel more disgusted at the other asians trying to reject him. 

I just want to tell you that although a lot of more traditional asians think that way. Not all do. I'm sure same with black folks. It's just sad that being in a highly mixed nationality of a country that we have, people still can't live the way they would want to live their lives."

13,mp561k,So sorry. My cousin is half Filipina/half black with a darker complexion. I've never asked her about these issues. She lives in a diverse place but I would not be surprised if it happened to her too.
14,mp561k,"I’m sorry you are experiencing negative and racist views on both sides. It’s real and awful, and I wish things were better. 

I am a lighter skinned, a Filipina-white mestiza (mixed). So I rarely get insults about my appearance (and I do recognize that’s an unearned privilege since light vs dark is also racism), but I feel isolated too. I grew up in white neighborhoods, and in the Philippines, so when I go to hang out with 2nd, 3rd, or 4th generation Filipino Americans, it’s clear that their lived experiences, speech patterns, dance, music, in jokes and shared history in the town I live in, are something I can’t be a part of. I feel lost when I’m with them, and more comfortable in pan-Asian-American groups, or with POCs and BIPOCs in general. 

In all white groups, I’m the multi-ethnic other (my hair is large and curly, so sometimes people think I’m a light skinned sister — but it’s more like Polynesian waves crossed with red Scottish curls; I look Latinx enough that sometimes at Mexican restaurants I get looks of disapproval for not ordering in Spanish, so I try to speak Spanish until I get lost and switch to English).

In Filipino groups (1st generation American or in the Philippines), I am the almost white American, not Filipina, and often excluded from conversation since I’m not fluent in Tagalog, etc.

Anyway, all of that is not the same as your situation. I guess I’m trying to say I understand a little, even as I recognize your situation is difficult and harder. 

I’ve been reading the book “Caste: the origins of our discontents” by Isabel Wilkerson about race, class, and the American caste system where whites are on top, then Asians, then Latinx, Indigenous peoples, African immigrants, then American-born Blacks. Just by existing, you span a wide range of “levels” of caste, which might be why so many people have said terrible things to you. You don’t fit into a convenient category, and a lot of people can’t handle that and will direct at you their own ire about the unfairness of the system and their place in it. But none of it is true! You get to be Black, and Asian, and Japanese, and all of it simultaneously, or none of it at all (just you, just human), and it’s ok if that changes moment by moment. We are complex. You are big and powerful enough to hold all of it (or will be one day soon).

Please don’t give up on everything. I (and we) accept you for who you are, Asian and Black and Asian American. You are wholly yourself and wholly deserving of walking through the world without racist BS running at you.

Over the years I’ve developed friendships with people who are similarly between cultures, or who travelled a lot as kids and are comfortable meeting people from all over. They tend to be more open minded, but I didn’t find them until I moved to a bigger city. I hope you can find healthy and supportive connections soon, whether here or IRL."

18,mp561k,"Sorry this is happening to you. As a community we've still got a ways to go in our interactions with other minority groups, the Asian spaces I've been in tend to be ridiculously insular (and I'm sure there are other words for them relating to your post). Not that you need to be told, but you have as much a claim to your Asian heritage as any of us here. If anything your voice is more important than ever *because* of your Black heritage, not in spite of it. Those who disagree should consider why they'd want to silence someone who has a greater understanding of both communities."
19,mp561k,">I have been told I am not Asian enough because of it

Being half white/Thai, I've been told the same thing as well from some people despite you know, literally being born in Bangkok."
20,mp561k,"My cousin's half Korean and half Chinese. I only recently realized that our half of the family always thinks of her as ""half Korean"" but her Korean side must think of her as ""half Chinese"". I told her that and she confirmed and laughed. It made me realize I was being racist too, not negatively exactly but by pigeonholing her exact racial makeup and gene flow contribution. 

I am ethnically Chinese but I was born and raised in the Caribbean. My primary language was Spanish. My friends all spoke it and my entire family. My father didn't even speak Chinese until he was like 10 years old. Anyway, the point is I felt pretty Dominican. I remember lying to my mother and telling her I felt I was Chinese when she asked me once (my mother was not born there, she was a mail order bride from Asia). 

Anyway fast forward to the USA. We moved to the USA. The interesting thing is I became more ""Asian"" and ""Chinese"" after moving here. People just used to think I was Filipino because I had a weird name (they don't romanize Chinese last names the same way Americans do), my skin was dark (tropical sun baby), etc. It is hard to explain but this country is so black and white in its race things, they see you and they *got* to peg you as one thing or the other. I think how others see you greatly affected my own identity as I was still a teenager. People who emigrate after they are older (after high school?) tend to keep their racial identity IMO.

The only time people accept me as Dominican are *other* Dominicans who also grew up in the island (not the ones here!) and I can share my anecdotes because I know what it's like to grow up with poor electricity, no drinking water from the tap. How people played music very loudly for the entire block to hear because back then that was probably the only music player for everyone. How they painted a bunch of sad sticks white and called that a Christmas tree. Finding cockroaches and lizards in coca cola bottles. It is kinda exhausting I have to ""prove"" my, I don't know what you even call it, hispanicness. 

I liked your story and I know it is very unfair how people treat you. Asian people (specially ones from over there) can be very racist too. I think everyone here understands you are treated differently because of how you look, and they understand the inner struggle you have trying to figure out what the heck *you're supposed to be* and wtf is this business that *other people* get to define what you are?"
21,mp561k,"I'm sorry you're going through this. It's a difficult time and I imagine doubly so for you. 

I'm a first gen immigrant that grew up in the US. I don't really have the same experiences as you when it comes to connecting with my asian side as a result, but I still have had a difficult time feeling like I belong with recent immigrants and non Asian-Americans as well.  

One thing I have noticed though is that usually language groups through meetup or paid courses tend to attract more open minded people. Just throwing this out there that maybe you'd feel better if you can find a language group you're comfortable with. Maybe a Japanese language group or helping a Japanese student practice English? You might have more luck connecting that way and not feel as isolated."

23,mp561k,"I'm a Korean American male that grew up poor in NYC and have many friends that are black. These claims that it's only black people doing it is obviously false, yeah sure you can argue that the crimes against Asians committed by blacks are overrepresented but you cannot argue against that a large majority of these perps have some sort of underlying mental illness. And it's unfortunate that black and native Americans largely suffer psychopathological illness as result of past traumatic experiences that their predecessors went through which no doubt can proliferate in the subsequent generation. Trust me a large percent of Asian people (as you may know) understand that this is nothing new and this sort of thing always happened since the day we set our foot in America; it's kind of odd and somewhat gleaning in a sense that the media decide to pick this up after all these years. Instead of looking at who is doing what, you should know that a large majority of black people took to the streets and marched along with other protestors to denounce Anti-Asian sentiments ever since the civil rights movements. 

This is just my opinion and I don't take into offense if you see it as wrong, but if there is one thing that I have a strong opinion on, is that despite the vast heterogeneity within the African American community, whether it be due to differing socioeconomic level, class, occupation, ethnicities (due to differing migration pattern or having some sort of European/ Indigenous ancestry in their blood), you should be proud that you're part of a race that are more successful in terms of solidarity than any other marginalized group to march against the injustices. And, don't doubt for a second that you're not Asian/ Japanese or whatever, because you are to the fullest extent.

I want to speak with both my filipino grandma and japanese grandma and be able to watch filipino cooking videos without subtitles lol. Same goes for manga, anime, and music.

This is a fucked up situation all around, but I have to say, you should go through with this.  I know it seems like you're just making the same complaint twice but for managers, being contacted by corporate regarding a complaint is much more serious than a customer complaining in person.  And if this still doesn't solve the issue then go nuclear on PF's asses (or just do both)."

Honestly, the reality of the situation is that nothing will happen of this. It's just another one of those incidents that'll go unnoticed and unchallenged. If the manager doesn't care, then there's nothing really to do. 

I hate to sound defeatist, but I'm sure each and every one of us on this sub has experienced something similar to what you have at some point in our lives. It's just part of being Asian-American. We can't trust that white people will simply give us the justice we deserve; the only allies we really have is each other."

If there were a mask mandate in your state or if PF requires masks, taking a picture of him maskless and tweeting PF saying that he was not following their masking protocol and their gyms are unsafe would have definitely got more of a response.

24,mlsnzj,"Fuck man. Hard spot to be in. I want to say you should inform them of what the current social climate is with Asian hate. That might give them the idea that you could potentially sue them or give them a PR backlash. I have no idea where you live but the more liberal it is, the more likely they’ll take action. 

If you want to take it to the next level, you could threaten to leave the company saying that they didn’t provide you with adequate help and you felt management wasn’t respecting your workplace safety. You could even contact corporate or make a stance on social media. It would be even better if you have video evidence.

28,mlsnzj,"Like others have suggested: the only way to get PF's attention is to blow this up on twitter.  Tag other Asian friends, orgs, cross post to other forms of social media.  Media usually helps as well, i.e.: take pictures of the outside of the PF in question, and get the gym ID # and post that as well.  If you can get a picture of the guy in question, it isn't against rules to post that.  Tag other friends besides your Asian ones as well.  Post on NextDoor, Facebook, Insta, Twitter  etc."

34,mlsnzj,"You went about this the wrong way and you're getting too emotional about this, understandably so perhaps.

You shouldn't have approached him, you should've just went to management directly and let them handle it. I know you approached him to not be a tattle tell. If you approach people, you become a target, possible dangerous situation that will escalate, name calling, yelling, fighting, ego, etc. Not everyone is normal and that was the wrong assumption you made.

NOW, that you had already approached him, and he already said what he said, you should of loudly say without shame so that everyone in the vicinity could hear it, ""You called me a chink for asking you to wear a mask you racist bastard""? This comes with risk.

Next, what you should've done was file a police report on the spot on sight.

Next, you need to write certified usps letter detailing what where when why with dates names locations, details. Be very evidenced. 

Then you are going to keep copies and mail them certified to the Planet Fitness Office AND their Headquarters. 

Then you will post the letter blacking out your private details to their instagram, Twitter, Facebook, etc, page.

STILL, file that police report.You can file online. Retain copies as evidence. Include a copy of the police report with your letter. Post it to social media with your letter, black out your private details.

What you're creating is a paper trail, should anything happen to you then, now, and down the road, you will get an attorney and sue. Also Planet Fitness may change how they handle racist situations and not be so flippant IF you go about things a certain manner that causes change. There are certain categories in Police Reports that this situation will flag under. Another poster has mentioned it. 

Do this immediately while it's all fresh. Keep a box, notebook, and file system. 

Don't bother emailing, phone calling. Only certified letters and talking in person. Now that you already talked in person with azzhole manager, describe how flippant he was to you. Be professional, don't talk like me lol. Be matter of fact. Emphasize your safety. Be evidenced and detailed. Keep copies of everything as evidence. Do certified mail as receipt. Don't threaten them. But you can say if this continues you will proceed with the appropriate course of action.

Now your choice is to continue to work out there or not.

Stop being so emotional, carry mace, document with certified usps letters, be matter of fact and evidenced, be aware of your safety, do not approach people next time, let management do it, sue if necessary, don't bother with emails and phones. Certified usps letters and in person. Money, legal action, in person, certified documented letters, social media, talks.

File with Better Business Bureau, yelp, Google reviews, if this escalates, District Attorney of your county, file that police report.

Now you know what to do next time. Your welcome.

Or your other option is to let it go. That's up to you. But if you want to take action, these are the steps. The way you went about it will not cause any action on their part. The way you went about it just caused you potential harm."

>	I get to be fifth generation american on both sides of my family, more american than most people I meet, I don’t even speak Chinese, but I get to not feel like I belong here or anywhere.

I know this is just an off the cuff post, but I wonder if there is something to be said about confusing messages with regards to what it means to be Asian-American/Chinese-American. I know this is not what you ""meant"" but children are sponges and they absorb even implicit messages. A naturalized first gen is equally as American as someone whose family goes back many generations. Speaking Chinese or another language doesn't make one less American and not speaking a non-English language doesn't make one more American. I understand what you mean because racists use things like being a ""FOB"" or speaking Chinese, etc. to attack vulnerable Asians, but it is important to push back against these ideas in front of kids, not internalize them, even if you mean it sarcastically. Your daughter herself is half Chinese. Enforcing negative stereotypes about who and what Asian Americans are, even if it's just little things, will confuse and make her uncomfortable with her heritage.

Also, some people in since deleted comments were going too far with the emphasis on your partner being white and coming out of left field with accusations of you being ""self-hating."" However, it's true that it's hard to navigate the issue of racial identity in childhood for mixed race kids. Asian-White mixed kids sometimes either infer from the racism in society or directly receive messed up messages from adults that being half white somehow makes them ""better,"" and this is a source of pain and identity crisis/confusion for many mixed (and ""full"") Asians. In a country where white supremacy and racism against Asians is real, I think it's important to teach kids not to be ashamed of being Asian. Again, it's not the case that you are doing something wrong with your daughter or your daughter is wrong;  I've worked with many children with your daughter's background and these are just difficult things that need to be reckoned with, especially given what she expressed to you about ""Chinese people."" She is going to grow up in this world as part Asian, and unfortunately due to the racist legacy of ""one drop rule"" ideas, that part will have an oversize effect on her experience of race and racism in America. It's important to confront these things head on and model anti-racism and how to be proud and confident in being Asian. Best of luck to you and your family."

It's as you said: it's simple enough to reach a child.

Children are frequently more impressionable than we give credit for. You're looking at what is likely to be an entire generation of Asian and half-Asian-American children who will blame themselves for something out of their grasp.

This is where I'm at. I grew up believing in the unique virtues of the American Experiment, in America's exceptionalism (even in the face of it's white supremacist history), and most of all in my fellow Americans. 

American democracy is a pitiful, antiquated circle jerk of a lie. This rock we're hurtling through space upon is right to kill every last one of us. I look at the future of humanity and see plague, famine, death and we probably deserve all of it. 

I think about my mental state and realize that I'm just waiting to die. I'm tired of having my heart broken by fellow human beings, so internally I'm permanently lowering my expectations of others and just continue to disengage from society at large.

I try not to bum out my own family, and it's hard. My biracial kids are everything to me. But even that is cold comfort, because I am leaving them an earth where they'll have front row seats to the undoing of mankind. There are days where I can't contain the simultaneous joy of looking at their faces with the immense guilt of knowing we've failed them.

Sure, we may not all face the same level of racism and discrimination, but just because we don't does not mean our children won't.

It’s some of the dumbest mental gymnastics I’ve read.  Acting like Asia is one country and we’re all the same.  That’s not to say that there isn’t racism and discrimination in Asia but it’s just another bullshit statement used frequently as if they’re saying whatever thing that is posted justifies their prejudice against Asian people.

Another one is “people in Asia aren’t offended”, therefore us Asians not born or are not from Asia that we aren’t real Asians according to them can’t complain.

I’ve brought it up before and it doesn’t help that some Asian people have no self respect and repeat this ignorant bullshit.

I normally don't generalize and I'm sure there's a lot of Dutch people who do not respect this kind of thing. But Belgium/Dutch culture? Racism is still a pretty heavy part of their culture. Their version of Santa Clause has fucking blackface helpers (Zwarte Piet). Its origins do not have blackface themes; it was implemented by a 19th century author. Even the origins and the appropriation of using blackface to represent the archetype has racist connotations (as they replaced enslaved demons and imps).

I argued on a post about that high school pic and it got brigaded by bunch of people from belgium sub. Half of the people that took the effort to argue with me? I used the nwordcountbot on them and it flagged them as saying nword with hard R. One of them was banned for n-word spam. There has been anti-blackface sentiment in the Netherlands as well since the 60s so none of this shit is new. The country and culture as a whole just refused to change and the consequences are a country/culture that kind of imitates the type of institutional racism America hasn't even seen in decades. Even their fucking arguing points down to the wire is exactly the same as the racists from 50 years ago

10,fh22i6,"I lived in Henan for eight years and not a single day went by where random people didn’t yell HELLO at me and laugh on the street. One time I was in a barbecue restaurant peeing and some guy barged in to use the same stall and look at my dick, then yell “NOT TOO BIG” to his friend outside when leaving. People just assumed I was an idiot and couldn’t understand anything they said. I had a friend who was really overweight and everywhere he went people were literally like “老外胖子” and he couldn’t understand Chinese so he never noticed, but it really bothered my.

My (soon to be ex) wife’s family doesn’t call me by name. They refer to me as “laowai”. I ask them not to, but they do it anyway. Always have.

I’m supposed to be part of their family but that’s all I am to them, a foreigner. Nobody in MY family would ever talk about HER that way. She is a person. We refer to her by name.

Eventually I decided that in order to be racist you have to intentionally want to hurt someone. Ignorant people can’t help being ignorant. It’s not their fault. If you’re a black guy in China everyone will just go NBA NBA NBA and shove beers at you in bars but they think they’re being friendly, and their girlfriends will probably friend you on WeChat.

It’s worse for Filipino people there. I worked with a Filipino English teacher who was constantly being cornered by parents and accused of being Chinese and pretending to be a native speaker.

But, like, Luoyang people are prejudiced against Zhengzhou people. 老城 people are prejudiced against 心区 people. Everyone in China is prejudiced against Henan people.

My mom is friends with a bunch of professors in Beijing and when she told them I was marrying someone from Henan they pulled her aside and very concernedly informed her “henan people are... not.. good people”.

I dunno. My personal opinion is that prejudice exists because of physical structures in the brain that determine how we remember and group people, as detailed in this 2007 Cracked article by David Wong.

Popularized during the 19th century, Black Pete helps Saint Nick in passing out Christmas gifts for all of the good boys and girls. This character is always a white Dutch guy wearing black face. In recent years, the more liberal elements in the Netherlands have been complaining that this is racist. The conservatives don't care. It probably doesn't help that the Netherlands is over 80% white. Nearly all non-white Dutch are immigrants.

Many years ago back in 1996, I had the occasion to visit Amsterdam. I was staying at a hotel and wanted to visit a museum. The concierge outlined a U on a street map. I didn't think to ask him why he had me walking parallel to the canals instead of just cutting across the U to reach the museum.

The area along the canals were bustling with people. The path I chose in cutting across the U was not. It turned out that there was a reason why. A neo-Nazi skinhead group had claimed this as their territory. I learned about this when I walked past them on a corner. They were six of them lined up against a wall. They were all urinating onto the sidewalk.

I pretended I didn't see them and walked on past. I heard the cursing as they finished their business and began zipping up their flies.

As I walked past a parked car, I looked into the vehicle's side mirror and saw them following me.

When I angled across the street, I saw them reflected in the storefront window of a shop. They were crossing the street to come after me.

With only two blocks remaining to the canal, I broke into an all out run. The gang followed me. I reached the canal just a few yards ahead of their fastest runner. The skinhead sketched a Nazi salute at me and shouted, ""AUSLANDERS RAUS!"" (foreigners out).

I was admittedly lucky. Things could have gone very wrong. A few seconds earlier or later would have had the skinhead group ready and waiting to ambush me. As it was, I happened across them at the best possible time (at least for me)."
5,mxm8ns,I've always thought racism wasn't as bad in other countries as it is in the US. I've realized it only seems worse because it is very overt and often gets violent. I'm realizing that the casual racism in Europe is actually worse because at least it seems we try to check racism and racists here in the US. Because we do it seems like a worse problem here.
6,mxm8ns,"I had a breakdown while on a school trip years ago in Europe, it was the first time i ever went and it was a shock. I could remember just breaking down in tears in my room while the other students who shared it just pretended not to listen. I was the only poc and Asian in the group. Some Germans treated me harshly, a Turkish guy ridiculed me in the street, Greeks were a mixed bag. Got to know some Eastern Europeans and immigrants (fellow Asians / Filipinos)  though  too and they were nice."
7,mxm8ns,The spotlight regarding racism against Asians is always focused on the US that people don't realize that it's just as bad in Europe. What's worse is that sometimes they're in total denial about it.
8,mxm8ns,My friend lives in Switzerland and the Swiss people say she is spreading COVID and call her names. She hates it.

11,mxm8ns,"I'm studying abroad in Spain in 3 weeks, this is GREAT timing"
12,mxm8ns,"I've lived in the USA and now live in Europe(Germany).

1. Europe is a big continent with a lot of incredibly different regional cultures - some are more hospitable than others. YMMV depending on which country you go to, although a major of countries in Europe will have more casual anti-asian racism than the US. E.g. I think it's hard for Asians to grow up in France.

2. Asian Americans have (on average) been in the US much longer than Asians in Europe. This means that the nature of interactions between Asians and non-Asians is different here and also means that there's not as much pan-asian solidarity in Europe. 

3. Not defending Europe here, but it's far less likely that you will be violently attacked here because of your race. It's also far less likely that you will find yourself in a situation here that might escalate out of your control."
13,mxm8ns,"The irony is that countries with a much more diverse and non-homogenous population will always appear to be more ""racist"" yet are also most likely to have more progressive policies on race than homogenous countries simply because they have the social conditions that necessitate racism but also to combat it. Imagine a town with 100% white people; it technically would never experience any racial incidents since there wouldn't be non-white people in the first place. On paper it would seem that the town is ""not racist"" but in reality they wouldn't have a clue on racism and how to deal with people of a different appearance."
14,mxm8ns,Thanks. I had been planning a vacation. Maybe later.
15,mxm8ns,"Yeah growing up my family bounced around Europe whenever my parents were on sabbatical. My father is white, and the kids all could pass as fairly white as small children, but my mother would get stared at and treated poorly by staff at cafes and museums and things. I think when we first went on sabbatical when I was like 5 was when I started to really notice this kind of subtler racism than like outright slurs and things."

Must be nice to be so ignorant of the world and other cultures.

It did not go over well."

6,kr2dqe,"""No unnecessary numbers on flowers""? Do they actually know how to play Mahjong or do they just like saying they play Mahjong like people who collect instruments or skateboard decks? Also, how they laid out the bamboo and the dots on some of the tiles is just shitty design. Not surprisingly, their team is a sea of white. I didn't see one Asian person. Completely disappointing but not surprising.

Edit: I've been informed that this might be made for the Americanized version of Mahjong, which was played by US GIs during WWII (and maybe earlier). Apologies, as I learned Japanese Mahjong from my dad and later learned other versions from friends, but never the Americanized version. However, the pricing is still ridiculous and the design still sucks in my opinion. Also, the fact that their website didn't mention anything about the game's origins and where it's commonly played, and these women used a hastily put together mishmash of ""Asian"" props in their promos makes me lean more towards this being ignorance with a dash of ""oriental exoticism"". Still seems to me like another example of privileged people not researching and/or seeking feedback and insight from a community."

Instagram still up because probably invested a few hundred bucks to shoot their ""edgy"" videos and want it to be up in the hope of it'll be a sensational product. That's why they muted comments. But their YouTube comments up. Prob disable soon though. 

The probkem lies that they don't address it ASAP. If this is not cultural appropriate but appreciation, please do tell me because I genuinely do not know. Or if you have got nothing to say, just apologise and take it down. People will forget it very soon. I mean their sponsored or collaborated people took it down ASAP. 

EDIT. IF U WANT TO BUY MAHJONG. THEN BUY TIFFANY AND CO OR LOUIS VUITTON FOR A SIMILAR Price. NVM. THEY'RE LIKE 10000 LOL

Okay they addressed it. Gl with business anyways


Edit: Guys they have edited it. But idk man. Still fked up though. Yeah I forgive them but not the price though. Hong Kong master mahjong sculpture is a dying art craft, I rather support 300usd to him because he sculpts it with his hands and he's like a cute grandpa who said he's sad that no one wants to learn and he will be the last mahjong sculpturer."
9,kr2dqe,"Their mahjong set looks like the Powderpuff girls exploded all over it. 

And as a Powderpuff girl fan growing up, that is extremely offensive on many levels."
10,kr2dqe,"I'm trying to figure out what this company is actually trying to achieve here...

From what I understand from their statements, this is meant for people who don't play Chinese Mahjong, who have a hard time playing Americanized Mahjong because they don't know what any of the symbols or characters on the tiles mean, thus they have trouble understanding the game and its mechanics.

How does changing the names and visual appearance of the tiles, then changing the game by changing the rules and adding new/taking out old tiles actually fix the fact that both Chinese and Americanized Mahjong were difficult to learn in the first place? And if the learning curve hasn't been improved, then how does this ""refresh""/""re-invention"" of the game make it any better of a game than the old versions like they claim that it does?

Take chess of example: I can take out the rook, replace two of the pawns with pit vipers and give the Queen a jetpack, but that doesn't doesn't automatically make my version of chess better and it certainly doesn't change how difficult it is to learn chess..."
11,kr2dqe,"Don't get me wrong about this; I love Mahjong and played it a lot with my family growing up but I can appreciate the effort to draw in a new crowds with stylistic choices. I would love to see Mahjong recognized and being more common out side of ethnic enclaves but changing the rules does rub me the wrong way; that's not cool to me. 

Over the top colors and new image style; fine but don't expect me to buy it. Play the game with flashy new tiles cool; be excited. New people want to learn the game; awesome but don't go teaching your own personal version of the game trying to lead a new era."
12,kr2dqe,"I'm just worried that all this backlash will have the opposite effect and cause these mahjong tiles to become bestsellers, similar to how the whole ""American Dirt"" controversy played out-- white people were so mad at Latinx writers daring to question a non-Latinx person's right to write about the Mexican experience that they made the book the best-selling novel of 2020."
13,kr2dqe,"As far as the tiles, themselves, go, there's no accounting for taste. If they and their customers like them, that's fine. The problem that I have is with the language used,

>...she decided the venerable game *needed* a respectful refresh"", and, ""bring Mahjong to the stylish masses.

""Needed""? Really? Their ""improvements"" were ""needed""? As if there was something stale and stuffy about the game before they came along. Then, in the American vs. Chinese section, there's,

>""Well, all the madness of mahjong began in China hundreds of years ago, so they own that distinction fair and square.""

This smacks of them stealthily trying to take ownership without taking ownership of the game."
14,kr2dqe,"Okay I don’t really agree with this company on how they were so blatant to disregard the history behind the beautiful tiles as “confusing” to justify their alterations. But I would have to disagree with the people here saying that it’s wrong for them to change the rules.

There are actually MANY different variations of how to play mahjong, including an American version. [wiki link (check “Variations” tab)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahjong)

I’m Filipino and I played mahjong with my Chinese friends and I noticed that the rules were slightly different. The Filipino variation had a joker and included sets such as “NEWS” (North, East, West, and South) and “Beauty” which were pairing the red (center), green (fortune/wealth), and mirror tile (white), but only on your first turn.   I quickly learned that the Chinese version did not have this. I called grabbing the discarded tiles “Pong” and “Chow”, while they called it “Pong” and “Surn” respectively. We ended up trying out both styles and found a combination of both variations that worked out for us. I don’t think there was anything wrong or culturally inappropriate with that.

I’m just saying that mahjong has been around for a VERY long time and has been passed down to many different cultures which have all given their own take on the classic game. There are also other variations of Korean and Vietnamese mahjong that have their own unique set of rules and play styles. I’m not Chinese, but was it wrong for Filipinos to adapt mahjong into their culture? I still know the characters for 1-9 and the cardinal directions and I respect the Chinese origins of this game.

I just see this as an attempt to introduce mahjong to a wider audience, although it might not have been the best approach."

20,kr2dqe,"Bruh Mahjong is a perfectly fine game. It’s been part of my culture for centuries. It doesn’t need a fucking “refresh”. you’re the only one who thinks that, and it’s probably because you’re too stupid to play the game normally.

33,kr2dqe,"The comments on this post helped me see why people are so offended by it. The creators seem to go out of their way to unnecessarily put down the mainstream version of mahjong in their hurry to differentiate their product.  

To be honest, when I first heard about this story, my first reaction was that people need to get over themselves and not take it as a personal assault.  (Have you seen a pizza menu in China?  Italians were *not* consulted.)   

I am genuinely curious if there is a different perception of this by Chinese in North America vs. Chinese on the mainland. It seems like in related incidents in the past, there are favorable reactions from mainland Chinese of outsiders taking on their cultural symbols than those who have emigrated."
34,kr2dqe,"Not cultural appropriation, this is a different game, the one Jewish grandmothers play. Let them have their game because they admit it is not the Chinese version but the American one. ( I never knew there was a National Mah Jongg League until today.)

For example, Dominoes has a 黑糖珍珠 pizza in Taiwan. Although that would probably make an Italian roll over in their grave, it is not cultural appropriation. 黑糖珍珠 = Brown Sugar BoBa Pearl Pizza. The pizza also has 麻吉, but I don't know what that is in English."
35,kr2dqe,"I hate to see Orientalism of any sort in general, but I honestly don't see the problem here, other than the price points for the Mahjong sets, perhaps (tho they do look nice and well-made). This seems to me like healthy cultural syncretism. As with food, many board games are in fact amalgamations of cross-cultural currents, and I welcome Mahjong entering a cultural public domain.

The alternative is an atavistic racial territorialism that is ugly, especially at a time when American-Chinese relations are at a low point. It's the opposite of the cosmopolitanism that I'd like to see occur as we emerge from the foul and fetid Trump era of ugly nationalism and hate. We shouldn't be stooping to one-dimensional gutter nationalism and petty proprietorship of culture. 

If the beef is over their commodifying an Asian game, there's nothing stopping you from selling your own set, either. There are far worse things that white women could be doing than this."
36,kr2dqe,Why does everyone assume that everything foreign is some ancient tradition steeped in great spiritual or cultural significance? Mahjong is a parlor game invented a couple hundred years ago. Bitching about this is like a Westerner bitching about a custom Monopoly board.

0,hsv5kn,"I'm so excited to see and hear more Asian musicians! Its hard to find music I like in general, let alone music by POC."
1,hsv5kn,"BTS definitely put K-pop on the map and I was so surprised to hear Korean on the radio in my car (besides the other time with PSY - Gangnam Style) in an area that is not predominately Asian.  I'm not surprised that many artist want to collab with BTS, including Steve Aoki, because of how popular they are.

The lack of music artists (any artists for that matter) growing up definitely hit me like it did with Steve Aoki and Bruce Lee-- trying to find someone to look up to.  The only Asian artists I was listening to in the 90's-early 00's were artists from foreign countries (China, HK, Japan, Korea) or those RnB slow jams mp3s (NU Flavor, Simple, Kai, One Voice, etc). Once the mid 2000's hit, you had bands that contained Asian artists (Smashing Pumpkins, Sound Garden, Linkin Park, Black Eyed Peas).  MC Jin was a beast once an Asian broke into the freestyle game.  I think I got shocked again when I found out Far East Movement were all Asian.

Obviously you hear all their interviews and it's always the same: parents wanted me to be in STEM, had no one to look up to, no one to turn to for help in this industry, etc.  It's no wonder Asian Americans have gotten into the game so late.  I'm glad to see companies like 88rising and even Steve Aoki's label trying to support artists and filling in those missing pieces."

0,dhr2cd,"For those unfamiliar with the Vietnamese áo dài (what Musgraves is wearing above), it's not a ""dress""; it's a **tunic** meant to be worn with long, flowy pants, *always*. That's why those slits are waist-height; they were never meant to show off your hipbones! Michelle was exactly right with the comparison to not wearing pants in public. Musgraves *was* wearing a shirt without pants!

It's not just that she wore an áo dài on stage (and yes, she performed like that); it's the clear effort to ""sexify"" the outfit, the ridiculous posing, the purposeful ""oriental""-looking jewelry, the long, straight black hair, everything. I'm all for a woman taking ownership of her sexuality, and Musgraves is free to show as much skin as she wants and pose in whichever way she wants, but not in an áo dài.

That suit was settled out of court with what the Harpers’ attorney said was a favorable decision for the family. Ha says the civil case was covered by insurance and was out of his hands, but he still bristles at one demand the Harpers made in litigation: They wanted the knife Ha used that night. “Which I find odd,” Ha says. “I think that was kind of like a really petty thing.”

>At about 4:15 p.m. on August 30, 2010, Birk was driving his patrol car and saw Williams near Boren Avenue and Howell Street. The dashboard camera of Birk's patrol car showed Williams walk ""through the crosswalk, hunched over (with) something in his hands, then disappear(ing) offscreen"". Birk emerged from his patrol car with his pistol drawn. Birk yelled, ""Hey"", ""Hey… Hey!"", ""Put the knife down"", ""Put the knife down. Put the knife down!"" Less than 5 seconds after the first ""Hey"", the sound of gunshots was recorded on the camera. Williams had been holding a ""scrap of wood"" and ""a single-blade pocketknife"". Officers who arrived on the scene after the shooting and nearby witnesses later observed that the knife Williams was carrying was closed 

so essentially this john williams guy just walking down the street minding his own business and 5 sec later a cop jumped out of his car and and shot him. later on this Dan Satterberg guy decide to NOT PRESS CHARGES. its even more unfathomable after 2 cases like these (probably even more) this guy is still in office wasting tax payer's dollars. absolutely disgusting"

In that obscurity, there is massive amounts of sockpuppetry that is literally built into the design of the platform through the moderators who are often sockpuppet accounts themselves, or complicit in tone-policing to benefit their colonialist-tendencies and to advance their agenda/perspective.

If you try to engage in any serious discussion about race in any main or /r/all subreddit, or even when you are participating in many of the niche subreddits and want to feel safe and human so you call out microaggressions, almost certainly you will be trolled by bros or incels.

Second, honestly, this ""too ugly for China"" thing is dumb, but not unexpected. Mainland Chinese / East Asian standards of beauty are very different from Western standards of beauty, even for Asian people. That's why they've always said that Lucy Liu is ugly. That's why they thought most of the female stars in CRA were ugly. You know what? Who gives a fuck? Simu Liu is *our* superhero, just like CRA is *our* movie. He doesn't have to meet arbitrary, rigid, oppressive beauty standards in China to qualify for that.

Example: John Cho, Ki Hong Lee and Steven Yuen are fucking hot, but they look nothing like most Korean male stars in Korea. I'm glad that they don't! I'm glad that Asian stars in the West (not just America) don't fit into the very rigid Asian beauty standards, that there's more facial and body diversity among them and that they actually are more representative of real Asian people. I'm glad that John Cho, Ki Hong Lee and Steven Yuen look *nothing* like one another, while a lot of male (and female!) celebrities in Korea have to have the same look, and if they don't, they're practically forced to get plastic surgeries to obtain it (a nose job + double eyelid surgery combo is literally called the ""kpop combo"", lol). I'm glad that Lana Condor, a Vietnamese American girl raised by white parents, actually looks more like a real Viet person than the majority of celebrities in Vietnam, with her hooded eyes, a not super tall nose bridge, a round face and tan skin. If she had grown up in Vietnam, she would've had to ""fix"" all these things about herself to become an actress. I'm glad that we have Sandra Oh, Ali Wong, Randall Park, Constance Wu, Awkwafina, Eugene Lee Yang, and Simu Liu, people who are beautiful in their own ways without having to always have pale skin, double eyelids, a tall narrow nose, a v-line chin or whatever the fuck is trendy in Asia these days. People who represent us and actually look like *us.*

Also, Simu not fitting into the super rigid beauty standards in China doesn't mean anything for Shang Chi's future success. Black Panther did really well in China actually, and made a ton of money, and China is colourist af. So yeah, who cares if he's a 3.5 in China? He's a 13.5 here in North America because he's hot, talented, and just generally a damn good person, and he deserves all the successes coming his way."

6,cocmce,"Does no one who actually understands mandarin watch this video or something lol

First of all, if anyone bothered to watch the video (itself with **overly simplified translations of what the interviewee is trying to express**), only one girl gave him a 3.5, the first gave 7.5 and another 6.5, so most consider him average to above average. (On Zhihu and Weibo, most expressed that he looks older than his age, so they were disappointed that eddie peng or Daniel Wu wasn't selected instead, both of whom has a bigger fanbase with dedicated fans that will pull for their idols. Daniel Wu is also the ""national husbando"" with hordes of stans pissed off about the missed opportunity.)

In the video itself, the girls who expressed their opinions at more length both said they support the diversity of beauty standards, and that the main reason people expressed as the reason they are pissed off about the casting is that Hollywood seems to ONLY go for *ONE specific type* of Asian face to portray Chinese characters, and that ONE specific set of features is a very stereotypical portrayal of Chinese people. Most Chinese people are ***aware*** that when white people pull their eyes to make the slanted gesture, it's racist, so when mostly white movie studio cast faces that fits exactly what they make fun of Chinese people for, ***when Chinese faces in itself have a diversity of features***, Chinese people are naturally suspicious of it.

ESPECIALLY when the source material (Shang-chi's father being fu manchu, and bringing back the Mandarin as a villain, when the appearance in Iron Man 2 was already a decent critique of the American military industrial complex creating racist boogyman to distract from the ""real enemy"") draws from very racist depiction of yellow peril.

This is NOT about having hooded eyes or monolid double eyelid, most of the current batch of national husbando ([1](https://imgur.com/hh7ocCT) [2](http://img.quepian.com/file/p/2019/07-18/f335984ae6138a36e7da7b1359c3a423.jpg) [3](https://inews.gtimg.com/newsapp_bt/0/9107156195/1000)) have mono/deeply hooded eyes, however, from the Chinese point of view, they have the 3 examples shown, but also actors like [hu ge](https://i.mydramalist.com/dRwlWc.jpg), [huo jianhua](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/asian/images/8/8d/2fdda3cc7cd98d109839e5de243fb80e7aec9074.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160306153322), [jin dong](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/9b/15/7c/9b157ca7eb7eb8758d4cf703ad6e088b.jpg) etc, so clearly there is a RANGE to choose from when it comes to what CAN represent how chinese people look like, but again and again Hollywood opts for the features that confirm most closely to drawings like [these](https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/fumanchu.jpg) when it comes to the actors and actresses they chose. **So the criticism the Chinese girls being interviewed are trying to express is not towards Simu Liu in particular but a pattern that they see and are suspicious of.**

And before you say something like *""Chinese people are in denial of what they actually look like""*, evidence is quite clearly towards the contrary when we look like how Chinese people choose to depict themselves and who are popular and what not.

Beating everyone at the top boxoffice spot in China right now is the animated film Ne Zha, and in it, the [parents](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSd-5hSEUtTzUf0BU4eRAtu32ZVADGjSTTIHnkzxhSIHlslnxkC) are depicted as having relatively elongated [monolids](https://pic3.zhimg.com/80/v2-d4e9f2cf98def23eee2cb46800a3aec4_hd.jpg), Ne Zha himself has [large eyes](http://fs1.mingpao.com/yzz/2019-31/S00014/1564649075549SL_4C8E0778A771D62FC8055C92C466A729.jpg) but definitely does not look ""white"", then you have the bishie in the traditional sense in doublelidded [ao bing](http://pic1.win4000.com/pic/3/34/3c5fd671b8.jpg). On the TV side of things, [here is the two leads](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bkCfHm4jitk/maxresdefault.jpg) for one of the most popular TV show this summer. And [this is the poster](http://img5.mtime.cn/CMS/News/2018/08/19/092948.19163041_620X620.jpg) for one of the top box-office hits from last year. So clearly, when chinese people are in control of how they are depicted on screen, there's diversity and range of features.

When it comes to female actresses, many with monolids are considered beautiful and are extremely popular within China, like [Zhou Dongyu](https://frostsnow.com/uploads/biography/2017/05/16/zhou-dongyu.jpg), [Zhang zifeng](http://img5.mtime.cn/ph/2018/10/18/114327.44042801_290X440X4.jpg), Lin yilian etc. Even Li Yuchun, who was dubbed ""chun-bro"" recently started dressing more feminine, has a lot of people saying she's super pretty now.

Aside from an *unhealthy* obsession with being stick thin, Chinese beauty standards clearly allows for a diversity in facial features.

I feel like the concerns chinese people are voicing about how white media choose to depict them are valid, people just like to put it in the most click-baity context."
7,cocmce,"I wanted to reply to a guy's comments saying he agrees with the Chinese audience that Western media should have more diverse representations of Asians other than the ""stereotypical"" look, but I didn't want to potentially start a Facebook argument with my real account if the guy doesn't take it well so imma post my response here. 

""Based off the context of the video, I believe a diverse range of Asian appearance doesn't have to be conform to the narrow beauty standards in China, which consist of a slim face, pale skin, round eyes and a narrow nose etc. This level of beauty standards can be harmful because it teaches people to reject features deemed ""stereotypical"" like tanned complexion, a broader nose etc. Which is what's causing Chinese audiences to criticise Simu's appearance. It is unfortunate that they forgot there's a person behind the picture and doesn't realise the comments can potentially hurt Asians who are deemed unattractive because they have a common look among the population. 

I whole-heartedly agree with expanding Asian representation beyond stereotypes and I think they're doing good work with casting Simu. He's going to smash this!! ""

11,cocmce,"The video annoyed me but it does highlight why you don’t ask Chinese for their opinions about a specifically Asian-American and Asian diaspora problems of Hollywood representation. They won't understand how Simu’s casting is progress, the way it is to Asian diaspora.  In Hollywood, more often than not, it’s mixed-race Asians with white features that usually get the lead male role for what little exists for Asian casting.  Asian actors that look like Henry Golding tend to be the rule, not the exception for asian male leads In Hollywood. The same sort of bias exists for black women, where lighter skinned blacks like Halle Berry  traditionally have casting advantages over darked actresses that looked like Danai Gurira. The fact that Marvel cast an actor that looks like Simu rather than Henry Golding is a huge deal."

0,tmn7z1,"Hey all:

Several hours after this thread was posted, there was a wave of misogynistic comments posted at the same time by a few people. The mod team did their best to clean up the mess, but we can't be everywhere at once.

We hope we can rely on sub members to be our eyes in times like these. Please report rule breakers. We resort to locking a thread when the rule-breaking gets out of control. A lot of good dialogue is taking place here, though, so let's try to avoid that, if possible.

Please use the report function!

1,tmn7z1,"The essayist ponders the value of 'fear' at the end, which I found really poignant because it identifies a need to stand ones ground well before the threat of violence, to challenge people's thinking, to make them ashamed, or just to make them afraid to spread their thinking.

I think this recommendation should be heard by both Asian women and Asian men. Americans need to 'fear' us, to respect us, and all we need to do is turn the gaze back at them.

I don't think it's surprising that misogyny against Asian women occurs concurrently with the emasculation of Asian men or that we are almost treated as completely separate races, divided by gender, as if analogous to livestock. If you just imagine being in the brain of a misogynist... their immediate, perceived threat after all would be Asian men. I can't think of any other reason to explain their insistent need to fixate on our apparent masculinity, not so much to convince me of my inadequacies, but to convince themselves that I am not a threat. I don't think violence is the answer, but you can do a hell of a lot just pretending that it is."
2,tmn7z1,"Honestly you don't have to go far to find these types of ideas. In the seedier parts of reddit you will find similar sentiments and 'kinksters' who play with these types of tropes about Asians. We live in the wake of \~500 years of colonization, some of which is still ongoing. White people do feel entitled to our bodies & our time, and the truth is that we feel happy to be chosen or included.

In this day and age it is more important now than ever to re-examine our relationships with white society. Let every shitty, unequal friendship and romance fall away. Stop making excuses for or overlooking people who treat us as lesser. I often play back the small microaggressions and worry about their additive effect. That time I was overly deferential to some rude old white man, or let someone on the street get away with a snide remark, or the one time a white dude at the club who told me how much he loved Asian women, but instead of calling him out, I joked in my drunken stupor: ""hey, Asian girls love white guys, you should go for it"".

All those things add up. They reflect and refract and amplify online and in the culture until some guy at the far end of the bell curve does something shocking & violent. I'm not saying go around with a chip on your shoulder, but it's time to stop looking the other way."

6,tmn7z1,Stay away from the comments at the end of the article. It's people fiercely trying to discredit/gaslight the author and trying to shift blame to non-white men.
7,tmn7z1,"What a powerful piece. One thing I want to comment on:

>All of this would be simpler if these murders were committed by masked strangers who chose their victims by happenstance. But here is a tricky truth: Most of the men who murdered these women were their romantic or sexual partners, among them several long-term marriages. A relationship, however flawed, existed before it ended, which raises the thorny question: Did hate live within love? Or did love live within hate?

Neither. The answer is neither. A genuine, loving partner would never see you as an inferior person, they'd never belittle you or your ethnicity. Love did not ""live within hate"", nor did hate ""live within love"". Love was never a part of these relationships to begin with."
8,tmn7z1,This was such a hard read. It was both something I feel every Asian American already knows but also something we’re not allowed to talk about.
9,tmn7z1,"This was a super rough read, but worthwhile. The TW at the top is definitely warranted."
10,tmn7z1,"A few thoughts come to mind as I read this -

* I remain terrified of the world that my daughters will grow up in. I can only hope and pray that the way I raise them will make them strong enough and confident enough in their self-worth before they leave the safety of my home
* The author is ashamed about handguns, but I am not. I think more Asian Americans, especially women, should be encouraged into responsible gun ownership.
* It's important for this to be written and published, but I remain ever pessimistic. I don't think I will ever see positive change in my life. Non-Asian Americans remain both intensely and mockingly dismissive of racism against Asians; I have yet to meet one who acted otherwise at the outset of meeting them. Even now, some non-Black Americans are JUST waking up to the persistent systemic racism against Black Americans. If it took them that long with an outspoken struggle, then I will go to the grave with these problems as dismissed and ignored as it is today."
11,tmn7z1,"I shared this article with my Asian female friends, and almost instantly, they started defending white men by saying stuff along the lines of ""not all white men"".

We've really inhaled in a lot of that shit over the decades lol, eh."
12,tmn7z1,Thank you for sharing the article. That was really powerful.
13,tmn7z1,"I just can't with white men anymore. I used to tolerate them but I can't be around them knowing how much they dehumanize us. 

All my Asian bffs feel the same. They refuse to date yts. 

Some of my friends hate them all and can't stand to be around them. One more wave and I'm with them"
14,tmn7z1,"Reading this reminded me of the time when I was in the Marine Corps stationed in Japan around 2016.

I was one of the few Asians in my unit, and I remember overhearing a white guy ""jokingly"" talk about how he was looking forward to banging g\*\*k p\*ssy. I immediately got pissed off and confronted him about it, and he became extremely apologetic. There was also another white Marine who complained that it was reverse racist that he was denied entrance to the ""soapie"" brothels in Japan because he was a foreigner.

I know firsthand the kind of shit whites say among themselves when they feel comfortable, and from experience they also act cowardly if you call them out on it in person."
15,tmn7z1,I finally got around to reading this article (after preparing myself for it for the past day) and it feels as if Elaine Hsieh Chou plucked so many of the jumbled thoughts I’ve had about fetishization and the past years of AAPI hate and turned it into an eloquent and cathartic essay. So many of these things I’m honestly afraid of saying out loud and outside of the safety net of my small group of Asian American female friends because so many male friends (of all nationalities) always tell me “well at least you’re getting guys” or “I’d rather be exoticized than getting 1 match on hinge every 3 months” because they always neglect the part where we are seen as easier targets for violence.
16,tmn7z1,"The comments under the article are mostly white men that are blaming black men, surprise surprise"
17,tmn7z1,[deleted]
18,tmn7z1,"Wow, that was hard to read. I was in a diversity training recently where they listed a bunch of headlines about the violence that happens to black people just for being black. And I’d kind of gotten used to the idea that yeah, that happens, as awful as it is. But at the end of the list, they added that this happens to Asian women too, and listed one or two examples. And it just floored me. Somehow I’d been thinking of violence against Asian women as intimate partner violence mainly, with some random incidents, as though it was all separate and anomalous, instead of part of a larger structural racism that is just baked in. This article makes that really clear to me too — how common it is, and how ignored. And how, as much as I’d like to ignore it, this violence affects me too."
19,tmn7z1,"Its not hard to find these ideas. Look at porn, which is pretty mainstream. Remember outrage on a porn video where an asian woman is degraded racially and then fucked while eating chow mein off the floor. Or how many asian women in porn will say how they fuck white guys cause asian men are too small. All this then fuels white men to think this way.

As someone pointed in another comment, theres subs where the theme is asian women love white men and these subs are huge and much larger than any sub for asian people. And well theres plenty of participation by asian women. However, the blame shouldnt be squarely placed on these asian women since they are either trying to just make money from sex work or believe in these ideas from a society that pushes them

however i do wonder if there should be some blame put on those asian women cause they feed and propogate into these stereotypes of both asian men and asian women, even if they dont believe it and its only for money. In the end, other asians have to suffer cause of these ideas that have been spread by these asian women

And the asian woman only dating white guys is its own trope at this point, and lets be real its based on truth. How many asian diaspora guys know an asian woman that only dates white guys, answer is probably 100%. And again this is internalized racism, which was started by white people.

So I do have to wonder do we get mad at both men who are non asian spreading these ideas and the asian women who feed into them, or just the former. Since the latter is still a victim of these ideas even if they do end up hurting other asian women and men. Even if you focus on stopping non asians from thinking these ideas, does that mean anything when other asians themselves are spreading it. So should the focus be on both asians and non asians?"

27,tmn7z1,I wonder if there are a lot of white women say or think similar about Asian men
28,tmn7z1,"I'm a white American guy who happens to be happily married to a Chinese American woman. My observations from the inside of this debate: 

1) The sort of attitude demonstrated in this article definitely does not define all white guys, but it does define more of us than I think many want to admit to

2) I don't think this sort of horrible behavior is specific to Asian women; I've seen guys be horrible to Black women, to Indian women, etc. This isn't supposed to make it better, just to make it clear that I don't think Asian American women are the only ones facing this sort of awful crap. Guys like this tend to be awful, racist shits to *everybody.*

3) There's a lot of overlap between white guys who are grotesquely racist and those who are grotesquely sexist. That is, if you meet a white guy who is a racist asshole toward Asians, it's also quite likely that he's a sexist asshole towards women generally, too. There aren't a lot of dudes who are simultaneously virulently sexist but somehow not racist at all.  

4) The author is 100% right that a lot of these guys I've met clam up as soon as they realize they are being heard by someone outside other white dudes. This applies to sexism generally, too; some guys will be super sexist if they believe their audience is 100% male, but will behave notably differently as soon as a single woman is in the audience. 

To both Asian women *and* men here: keep on rocking. The people in this article suck, and you guys are awesome."

1,mlfls6,"I kinda dove into a rabbit hole into the portrayal of East Asians in Hollywood.

I was very surprised to see that back in the 1920s, Sessue Hayakawa, was a very famous actor in Hollywood. He was even seen as a ""sex symbol"" back in the day. Unfortunately, he only did silent movies, and once talking movies became popular, he had trouble getting work due to his heavy accent.

Then WW2 happened, and he pretty much had no opportunity to act due to anti-japanese sentiments at the time. 

He was able to make it back into the film industry in the 1950s... but he was just shoehorned into playing WW2 films as a Japanese soilder/general etc.

Just looking back on it, it seems like the anti-japanese sentiment due to WW2 played a substantial role in impeding the overall success of East Asians in Hollywood. But then again, we also had the Korean War and Vietnam War which also perpetuated anti-asian propaganda."

4,mlfls6,"Kareem is a real one, and shows such a great understanding of the historical issues with Asian-American representation in culture and media. He also understands and explains the nuanced differences of how Asian men and women are negatively stereotyped in media well, which I rarely expect non-Asians to get. Probably years of being friends with Bruce Lee made KAJ more attuned to this kind of thing when watching TV and movies than the average person.

More positive cultural portrayals of Asians and Asian-Americans in Hollywood really would make a huge difference. It's better than it was 10 or 20 years ago, but we still have a long way to go. I hope that when I am an old man, Asian-American boys and girls will be able to watch and see positive portrayals of themselves on TV in a way that I was not able to growing up."

This guy needs a reality check. Black-owned businesses should get help, I agree. But they're not the only ones who need aid or have lost their livelihoods. There's some pretty massive income inequality among the Asian American population, but fuck that noise, you used to go to a lot of Chinese restaurants, so they all make big bucks and can't be affected by massively lowered patronage due to a pandemic and racism, right?

This just baffles me.

Like, it's not that hard to go out and see that Asian businesses are being negatively impacted due to racial stigmas around COVID.

And for the sake of this argument, let's assume there was no stigma: the amount of customers would still drastically decrease because nobody's eating out.

Sure. You can make a fortune off of selling food.

Not to mention the long hours 7 days a week. If it wasn't run by family the business never would have survived. It was all of us together in one tiny townhouse. But people assumed we were rich and just eating off of the community. That mentality makes me so mad."

Light skinned API are called the “model minority” but darker skin is supposed to mean a person is less American - in that framework - and therefore less worthy

We APIMEDA need to stand in solidarity with other people of color against this kind of systematic racism that we are told to follow. APIMEDA can support black owned businesses and Latinx owned businesses, and vice versa.

12,gx46e2,He's not wrong that the city underfunds/aids small black businesses. I'm sad that he feels Chinese restaurants are benefiting.
13,gx46e2,These kinds of articles pop up every now and then where black politicians express anti-Asian views. I've been seeing it more frequently in past years.
14,gx46e2,"The conversation was about businesses that may have difficulty accessing aid if English wasn’t their first language. How many Chinese restaurants can there be in Norfolk compared to black businesses? Do black people not speak English? 

Riddick’s argument that Chinese restaurants make enough money already and don’t need help is the same argument people make to refuse or deny aid to the black community: Don’t they already get enough?"
15,gx46e2,We can call and write to let him know he's wrong. Paul Riddick can be contacted on the Norfolk city site. Wasting our energy in this sub is not going to do anything.
16,gx46e2,"The best summary for this guy is ""I'm racist but deny that I'm racist"".  He tries to talk down on the other council people and justify himself by saying 

""I have nothing against the culture because before any of you guys came along, I had a Chinese festival to celebrate the Chinese community""

The other earliest elected council staff was in 2010, meaning before 10 years ago he attended one Chinese festival...whoop dee doo that totally justifies he isn't racist...

This mentality of supporting one community but totally disregarding and dismissing other communities needs to go."
17,gx46e2,"I understand that black folks want to help black people and they should. But doing something like this only furthers the divide between Chinese Americans and black people. 

If there were no demand, those restaurants wouldn’t be there. If they don’t want them there, they can choose to not buy the food and support the business.

But when Chinese (and other Asian) restaurants in America are harmed in the crossfire of White-Black racial tensions, it is unfair. 

And it is NOT THEIR PLACE to speak for us on how bad we were hurt or how much help we need, just like it is not white people’s place to speak on how black people feel."
18,gx46e2,"I support BLM, but the racism and prejudice against the asian community will never be a topic in this country. The asian community is the punching bag of society today."
19,gx46e2,Weren't Chinese restaurants disproportionately impacted by COVID-19?
20,gx46e2,"Thinking about it, racism like this is exactly why this dude got elected, for sure.

If he spoke up about racism as an issue of the white (majority, dominant, established...) community alone he wouldn't be accepted by the political establishment in any western country. If he brought up imperialism and the white-centric nature of the society he lives in, or the history our world is still living in, he'd be branded a radical and resented by whites.

But since he's willing to join in the shit-flinging at other minority groups while ignoring the real source of societal problems, he gets to be a councilman.

An increasing number of public figures are thankfully addressing whiteness as the real issue more, but even then the issue often gets derailed to the usual game of playing different minority groups against each other. And then there's the politicians who use their race as an excuse to shit on their own communities for not being good enough. It's the same story repeated over each different group tbh."

22,gx46e2,HE NEEDS TO STEP DOWN NOW!!!!!!!! he should not be holding any type of public office AT ALL!!!!!!!
23,gx46e2,"Damn. This is super frustrating to read. 

It's pretty disappointing for Asians to be targeted in this manner. I can see where the anger is coming from, but it's still sucks. 

That being said, I'm really hoping that this community isn't looking for validation of racism against Asian Americans during this time, and actively searching for reasons to re-center the victim conversation on AAs away from the BLM movement. 

Yes, it was fucked up for him to say that. Yes it was racism. Yes it was wrong. But, in his eyes, it's unfair that AAs get to be the model minority, and we, as an AA community, have to acknowledge that we live with that privilege in the white gaze. 

The model minority myth has kept the AA community down, there's no denying that. The thing is, like /u/bkny2020 said, it pits the minority communities *against* each other, and I think that's the most important takeaway here. 

We need to be better than that. 

At this point in time, I'm really hoping that this community isn't trying to use this article as a reason to bitterly sit on the sidelines with our arms folded, tapping our feet, going ""Well what about us?"" and pointing fingers. 

We *can* be better than that. 

Councilman Riddick's words fucking hurt because he's lashing out at other minorities in anger, and he's reinforcing a narrative that Chinese Americans (by extension of Chinese restaurants) don't give a shit. In his eyes, black people are  murdered in the streets for *existing*, and while the rioting and looting is happening, the AA community gets to ""reap the benefits.""  In his eyes, white people love greasy Chinese food, and white people are so willing to protect what they love, while black restaurants get ignored.

We continue to fight our fight for Asian American representation by supporting the current movement.  Not in spite of other minority communities, but in solidarity.  We're all fighting the same fight, and the AA community wouldn't be here if not for the civil rights movements that black people suffered to start. Riddick's words were unfair, and we have a right to be angry. I was just as angry when I saw that video earlier this week with the piece of shit recording himself looting from the Chinese restaurant. But he doesn't represent the black community, nor should we make that trash person or Riddick a poster child for the black community. 

Don't let instances of shittiness make you forget that as people of color fight among themselves, the real oppressors continue to shrug and say ""I don't see what the problem is"" as they profit. The fact that there is a *significant* number of members of our own community that contradict our own fight should really inform just how important it is come up with a message of solidarity, and I think it starts by highlighting what we have in common with the black community instead of searching for more reasons to convince ourselves that we are suffering too."

Even if folks aren't disgusted by his racists behaviors, have they read about his response to September 11th??? 

Wahlberg was booked to fly on American Airlines Flight 11 on September 11, 2001, but his plans changed the day before and he canceled his reservation. He received backlash for stating in a 2012 interview, ""If I was on that plane with my kids, it wouldn't have went down like it did"". He added that ""there would have been a lot of blood in that first-class cabin and then me saying, 'OK, we're going to land somewhere safely, don't worry.'"" He issued an apology after family members of those killed on the flight expressed outrage.[93]

(From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Wahlberg)"
1,svl9qu,Fuck no
2,svl9qu,"I don't take it more personally because the victim was Asian or anything, but yea I don't forgive him.

If someone beats up an old dude nearly to death for literally no reason then I'm gonna have a suspicious opinion of them for their rest of their life. I know that goes against the popular ideals of ""people can change, forgive and forget"" but idc. Normal people don't do that, there's definitely still something lurking down there inside a person like that even after many years"
3,svl9qu,"He's a repeat violent offender - a person with less privilege would have been locked up for years, if decades

Also, he publicly says he regrets it and has changed, but what else could he say from a PR perspective? Of course he's gonna play the ""I'm sorry"" card for the cameras

And what about his actions? Has he been using his fortune and platform to improve the causes of minorities?"
4,svl9qu,"Lol why are we thinking about forgiving him when he hasn't even apologizing? Dude is tried to even get a [pardon](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-mark-wahlberg-pardon-request-dropped-20160916-snap-story.html) from Obama, dude's not sorry, he just wants it to go away."
5,svl9qu,"Sure, an argument can always be made the ""people change"", but Mark Wahlberg has NEVER done anything that indicates he is actually remorseful.

&#x200B;

He did reach out a few years ago to that Vietnamese dude he attacked, but he only did so because **he was getting denied for an alcohol license for his Walhberg hamburger restaurants due to his criminal record.**

Go watch any interview with him.  The dude is an arrogant, cocky motherfucker.   Absolutely nothing has changed about him since his teenage years except for the fact that he is a cocky **rich** motherfucker now.

I saw one interview he did a few years ago where he was hitting golf balls off his roof....in a residential neighborhood.  -No concern that the golfballs would hit or seriously hurt someone.   The dude is an asshole, pure and simple."
6,svl9qu,"Let’s also not forget that he tried to have his racist, violent past completely erased from his record like it never happened. That doesn’t feel like repentance to me."
7,svl9qu,"Feel like he's only a relevant actor because he's the archetype of the type of all American redneck people love to see. It's easy to be fond and forgiving towards someone on TV that looks like your eccentric uncle or the town drunk at the bar you run into every Tuesday and talk about sports with. Who cares he beat some Vietnamese guys eye in, that's just how Marky Mark is, he's just like that, oh Mark classic Mark."
8,svl9qu,He hurled rocks at black kids and tortured an asian guy who was blind in one eye.
9,svl9qu,He can enjoy his forgiveness inside prison
10,svl9qu,"Judging by what others have commented here. He did some pretty bad stuff. He’d have to have severe punishment. Even if I don’t know these victims personally doesn’t mean we’re not affected. I think the more privilege and fame and status a person haves, the more important it is for those people to be punished.
 Like someone else touched on, in front of cameras it makes sense to play the “I’m sorry” card."
11,svl9qu,Mark Wahlberg never really made any sincere apologies for that violent attack he did on the Vietnamese guy. So uh...no absolutely not. He's a racist scumbag to the Asians.
12,svl9qu,"Fuuuuuuck Mark Wahlberg. I can’t even give Simu a pass rn because I stay fucking Mark Wahlberg


Fuck the new Wahlburgers at Morongo that displaced a solid, well located Fatburger too. Made those long work drives to the desert livable."
13,svl9qu,"For real. That guy is unapologetic about what he did to Asian people and yet, people forget all about those incidents."
14,svl9qu,"It's not my position to forgive, because I was not wronged. However, I can choose to boycott him, and dislike him, insult his name, and raise the fact he was a racist hater."
15,svl9qu,"Wish people talked more about this. Him saying “sorry” is just lip service and good PR with no actual actions of him actually showing remorse and caring about Asian and Black issues. I don’t think he can hide behind having a “rough past” because his actions were specifically racist and vile, not just criminal."
16,svl9qu,"Mark Walhberg certainly is different and changed from his old self back when he was convicted. Whether or not he no longer has prejudiced views or express racism is a different story. He has silently posted support for BLM during the pandemic while saying close to nothing afaik regarding anti asian hate. He has the opportunity to use the current events to talk about, address, and potentially redeem the mistakes he made. And he doesnt do it.

So either at best he's a coward but sorry and hiding behind the shame or he still thinks he did nothing wrong.

The whole ""live life with no regrets"" has become so perverted, I don't think people know wtf it means anymore."
17,svl9qu,I always point this out if someone asks me to see a MW movie. I won’t. He disgusts me.
18,svl9qu,"I think the *generous* answer would be that forgiveness for his crimes still doesn't entail me adding money to his already ample pile. As an actor and restaurateur and whatever else, he's in the service industry, and there's plenty of other people I'll feel better about giving my business."

Mark has done nothing to earn my forgiveness

Fuck that Nazi racist cunt"
21,svl9qu,I’ve only heard him say he regrets it when he first started to apply for a liquor license at his restaurant and he couldn’t because of his record. Kinda says it all
22,svl9qu,Fuck Marky Mark. He's just shitty shit.
23,svl9qu,Fuck NO.  Has he done anything to at least redeem himself?

Total scum bag who shouldn’t be rewarded with more Hollywood deals"

27,svl9qu,"The Asian man actually tried to help Wahlberg. His reward? Being called “Vietnam fucking shit” and being beaten so badly he was permanently blinded in one eye. Oh yeah, and he was a veteran who fought along side the Americans against the Communists during the war! Fuck Mark Wahlberg."

35,svl9qu,"A part of me says, Yes, we must allow people to change. BUT a part of me says, No, he only asked because his family's restaurant couldn't get a liquor license. I don't feel it's sincere. As far as I know he's not done any work in the Asian community or to end Asian Hate. BUT THEN AGAIN, his victim has forgiven him. I really should be about the victim of Wahlberg's crimes and nothing else."

0,os77je,"I studied Jazz Piano in college, it seriously sucks to be stereotyped by your race. So many times people assumed I started with classical music- I learned music by ear at first. I don't think I ever progressed beyond a novice classical piece until my senior year. After a certain point, it started to make me doubt my own ability, that I should be better because I'm an asian person. It really hurts."
1,os77je,I'm so utterly unsurprised by this story because I've seen the way classical music protects and cherishes every white face and discards the asian ones. Even at the local / regional level.
2,os77je,"http://asianclassical.com/viewtopic.php?t=77

Has more detail on this affair."
3,os77je,"Music criticism has always been bullshit.

I am still under the impression that certain composers, like Schonberg, are only so beloved because people think they're *supposed* to like them, and anyone who doesn't is just less smart about music.  You're better at listening to music if you can derive pleasure from composers who, frankly, wrote music that was less immediately pleasing to the ear.

I can sort of see that, but a lot of the supposedly profundity of certain types of music ends up not being particularly interesting.  ""Ooh, Schonberg was *mathematical*!"" people say, but when you're actually a mathematician (as I am) he doesn't seem to be doing anything profound.

Meanwhile, on the level of comparing individual performers, I feel like music criticism is sort of the same thing as wine tasting.

It's mostly just making up nice words if you think a performer is pretty.

It's not entirely subjective (*my* violin playing can't stand up to that of any decent professional), but at the highest levels, everyone is playing the right notes in tune, and the main differences are just interpretations of pieces.

I can listen to a dozen people playing the Beethoven Violin Concerto and then rank them according to my preference (which is going to come off as a list of who sounds the most like David Oistrakh), but trying to pretend it's any more than that, as if I can somehow come up with an objective characterization of a performance when using decidedly subjective criteria (PASSIONATE!) is a fool's errand.

If you want to say that performance A has more of some element than performance B, you'd damn well better have some way of measuring that element.  Otherwise, you are as likely as not to be reacting to some other element (perhaps something that's not even musical) without even realizing it.

And besides, we've all known for a while that ""stars"" are mostly just whichever performers are most photogenic.  Less so in the old days before albums were sold by pretty pictures of the soloist on the cover (Oistrakh was great, but he was not handsome at all).

None of this is a slight on the performers or the composers or most of the people who enjoy some of the greatest music ever written.

It's definitely a slight on critics who think they have something interesting to contribute."
4,os77je,This really makes me question the use of “personality” as a qualification when it comes to college applications and jobs. It’s too easy to conflate the stereotypes you have about a person with their actual attributes.
5,os77je,"I've heard this a lot. Asians are technically proficient, but lack soul. Blacks artists have a lot of passion, but lack technical precision.

Of course there's ""one group"" that can do both."
6,os77je,"Wasn't there a prestigious violin youth competition that had heavy Asian representation? But hardly any Asian violinists won. The comments they received were that they were technically proficient but emotionally vacant. Then they went to blind judging, and lo and behold, the Asian kids started dominating, lol. I just did some research. It might've been the Menuhin?  

At any rate, regardless of racists, Asians are gonna continue to kick ass."
7,os77je,This makes my blood boil.
8,os77je,Reminds me of the time when Harvard U was discriminating against Asian applicants by giving them poorer ratings on personality and demeanor (sayin that they were over-formal or cold) when white people behaving the same received praise.
9,os77je,"Oh wow. I remember when this scandal came out. I'm a pretty big classical music fan, the good thing that came out of this was discovering all the great music by these incredibly talented pianists that I and many others never heard of before. Interesting to see this here, and really maddening to read what that critic wrote about that recording."
10,os77je,Asian classical music can be very much appreciated.  Joe Hisashi and Ryuichi Sakamoto are the big name ones from Japan.

Not to mention, he spent the last month going on all in on the conspiracy theory that COVID is a hoax, encouraging people to protest shelter in place, and reopen the economy. Its possible at this point America will get to 3,000,000 infected and 200,000 dead.

6,f1l4qm,"Holy hell. When they won best screenplay I figured, alright, I guess that's it for the night. Then it was best international film, and then best director, and finally the big one. Really did not expect that. Also Bong Joon-Ho killed it with his speeches, especially when he won best director. The nods to Scorcese and Tarantino especially were touching I thought.

Also, I'm watching the after show with Maria Menounous and Stephen A. Smith. For some reason Stephen A can't get over the fact that Bong Joon-Ho won best director and kept asking guests what he thought about that."

13,f1l4qm,"I'm completely shocked and so incredibly elated by the wins that Parasite achieved tonight. I thought the film was flawlessly executed and one of the best movies that I've ever seen.

I was convinced that it would never win because of award show politics. The fact that it did in multiple categories, including Best Picture, is just mind blowing. Bong Joon Ho has made many great films and it's so cool that he's finally getting significant recognition for his work. Also, the cast members of the film were excellent and it was great to see all of them with some of the crew on stage. (It literally made me cry. What a powerful moment.)"
14,f1l4qm,"Well done, great film, pertinent to today's struggles in so many ways."
15,f1l4qm,Yesssssss! CONGRATULATIONS 🎉🥂🇰🇷
16,f1l4qm,"Damn, i really need to watch Parasite sometime..."
17,f1l4qm,"Well deserved! Not only did it keep me on edge, it was thought-provoking as well. Best movie I’ve seen in a while."
18,f1l4qm,An absolute masterpiece. Proof that language and race don't matter.
19,f1l4qm,Let's goooooooo
20,f1l4qm,Am I allowed to be excited about this even though I haven't seen the film yet?? Because I am!!
21,f1l4qm,"What I love about Bong is that his films are truly products of what he wants to make. Just check his other films. To have such a film be nominated for an award, must be such a endearing feeling for him. I cannot imagine being rewarded for something I am deeply passionate about, and not following unnecessary trends."
22,f1l4qm,So glad I watched the Oscars with my parents tonight! <3
23,f1l4qm,"[Praise](https://twitter.com/BBCLBicker/status/1226759615980793857) from South Korean president, Moon Jae In:

> ""We are proud of Director Bong Joon-ho, the actors and the staff. We are especially thankful for giving us the pride and courage to our people who have been going through hardship. *Parasite* proved to the world the power of our films with unique and detailed direction, witty sharp dialogue, script, editing, music, artwork and acting. *Parasite* is a result of everyone who have made Korean films for the past 100 years. *Parasite* is sad and humorous at the same time...It made me rethink the power and emotion a single film could deliver. Our government will work together with filmmakers so they could freely imagine and make films without worrying."""
24,f1l4qm,REAL FUCKING ASS DIRECTOR WON. Bong Joon Ho's body of work  of the past 20 years crushes the rest of the nominees easily. Sam Mendes is mediocre as fuck. Spectre was fucking garbage.
25,f1l4qm,"I find it funny that during Joon-ho's historic Best Director speech, he shouts out Martin Scorsese, and then the audience proceeds to interrupt his speech with a standing ovation for Scorsese"
26,f1l4qm,Surprised but Congrats!
27,f1l4qm,"I think part of the reason that Parasite won so many awards is how beloved Bong Jong Ho is by other members of the Academy. Yes, Parasite is a great film but a lot of great films haven't won Best Picture, Best Director, etc. Look at this [tweet](https://twitter.com/edgarwright/status/1226822886763237376) by Edgar Wright:

> The first time I went to Seoul in 2017 Bong Joon Ho hosted my Q&A and took me on a epic night out in various boozy vinyl record bars. Frankly it’s outrageous he didn’t get an Oscar for that. Couldn’t happen to a nicer guy.  It also says everything about him that he shouted out to Quentin Tarantino for supporting him since his early films while accepting Best Director for himself. Beautiful moment. 

So much of winning Oscars is about campaigning and networking, and it seems like Bong is a kind person who loves film."
28,f1l4qm,Super cool that an Asian film broke the barrier to become the first non-English film to win Best Picture... Super sad that the chaebol lady had to hog the stage rather than Bong Joon-Ho or even Song Kang Ho.
29,f1l4qm,"This is the year of Marxist movies like Joker or Parasite. The issue of wealth inequality is becoming more prominent everyday. Parasite perfectly nailed it, especially the class struggle part."
30,f1l4qm,Very well deserved. I'd heard about the movie but just hadn't had a chance to watch it until this morning. Great movie and very memorable.
31,f1l4qm,yaaaas!!!!
0,jvgcc2,they bought into the model minority myth and completely disregarded the diversity in the Asian community. the economic/achievement gap among asians is the largest in any race group. this isn't doing many underrepresented asians any favors.
1,jvgcc2," So... are we white??? Okay, hand over the privilege ✋🏼"
2,jvgcc2,"So we’re regarded as second class citizens by most people (Asian children are bullied by other students *and* teachers and coaches, Asian men are emasculated and Asian women are sexualized in a degrading way, and both are passed up in the workplace by less capable people), but we don’t get the same benefits as other minorities? Makes sense."
3,jvgcc2,How does it make any sense to take a group of people who are actually considered “of color” in broader society once in the workforce to be grouped with white people for an equity report in schools? You can certainly study achievement gaps without having to create this whole narrative (also I’d be really curious to see any studies on how the model minority myth influences Asian American children’s abilities in classrooms). Absolutely bizarre to take an entire demographic group that is most certainly not a monolith and shove it in the “white-adjacent” category while keeping Pacific Islander separate.
4,jvgcc2,"You mean, similary to how Asians are ""minorities"", but not ""underrepresented minorities"" when it comes to higher education (e.g., undergrad, MBA, other grad school)?"
5,jvgcc2,"So basically they're saying because the number are closer they should be treated as not students of color? That's kinda fucked up, just basing a race's experience on a few numbers."
6,jvgcc2,"Asian Americans have the worst economic inequality of any ethnic group in America. 

The racial gaslighting of Asian Americans across this nation is ridiculous. We are not your Model Minority. We are not a monolith. How many times do we need to say this. So much for ""progressives""."

25,jvgcc2,"Its important to understand that this happened in the context of identifying students that face ""persistent opportunity gaps."" There are certainly segments of the Asian American population that fall into that category. However, due to the persistence of the model minority myth, and the fact that ""Asian-American"" covers far too many ethnically, culturally, and socioeconomically diverse people groups, the statistical majority of ""Asian-Americans"" do just as well or better as their white peers and wouldn't fit into that category of ""persistent opportunity gaps."" To me, this decision by this school is meant to help funnel resources to historically underserved kids. We should be fighting to end the treatment of Asian-Americans as a monolith and end race-based designations that paint large groups with a broad brush. If we can achieve that goal, a designation such as ""Student of Color"" wouldn't be what determines whether or not a student receives extra support. Instead, we could focus on socioeconomic status which is a better way of identifying and helping those in need."

0,gxqact,"Bernice King (MLK’s daughter and an activist), Cardi B (I don’t like her but she’s a prominent black voice), and NAACP all called out the spike in Asian hate crime following coronavirus. My black colleagues have expressed solidarity when I bring up Asian hate crimes. I honestly don’t think Asians are on people’s radars, but that’s why we need more Asian leaders, not more anti-black white cops.

It only seems like the black community was quiet about Asian hate crimes because BLM is a much more publicized, organized movement that has stemmed from decades of police brutality. If Asians want support from other communities, we need to make our issues more well known and talked about in the first place. We simply don’t have the level of political or media influence that black people do. Lebron James singlehandedly made half the people I know learn about Ahmaud. I think anyone who claims to believe BLM but won’t support the movement because there hasn’t been an equal amount of black support for Asian issues is feeding into the idea that there is only enough room for one minority’s rights (the minority pie if you will). 

I support BLM because what happened to George Floyd and countless others before him was heartless, full stop. A vast majority of protests have been peaceful. The only people who win from us not supporting BLM are racist cops and institutions supporting white supremacy. The Immigration Act of 1965 was partially due to black civil rights efforts. I understand some Asians have experienced racism from black people, but I think that is a larger problem of the model minority myth and anti-Asian racism not being taken seriously. I don’t think supporting cops and institutions ultimately serving white people is the answer."
1,gxqact,Just remember that us being divided only benefits white supremacy.
2,gxqact,"I support BLM's cause cause we need serious police reforms, not cause Asians need to prove ourselves or something. To be honest I sorta see a lot of performative virtue signaling in our community, and these are the ones who are the most vocal / outspoken like they're trying to fit in. Jeff Yang falls in this category which is ironic because I think his article is trying to say we shouldn't do things to fit in anywhere...

Andrew Yang recently published a similar op-ed that was sorta like a call to action. I don't see much difference with what Jeff Yang's saying. Shouldn't we support something because it's the right thing to do, and be against something because it's wrong, not because we're Asian or whatever?

Dunno, I just see this double standard when it comes to certain people, like Jeff Yang can get away with saying stuff like this but someone like Andrew Yang can't. It's almost like there's this (manufactured?) divide within the Asian community that doesn't make sense to me. Do you guys see this too or am I the only one lol"
3,gxqact,We should unite in solidarity because it's the damn right thing to do- not because we're Asian.
4,gxqact,"There are no organizations that represent that national zeitgeist of asian-american sentiment. Asian-americans are not organized like black people are. That being said, most of us would agree that black americans pretty constantly get the short end of the stick. Black lives matter, period.

I wish organized black groups would have come out in support of the asian community during the height of coronavirus. I wish there would have been more condemnation of the attacks on asian people and businesses. There is a common sentiment in the black community that asians are complicit in white supremacy, which most of us know to be blatantly false. However I think a lot of people used this notion to justify antagonizing the asian community.

There is also a prevailing sentiment of dehumanization of asian people. That we're out to exploit other communities. That we only care about ourselves. That we take take take and don't give back. It sucks, and it's not true. We all just want what everyone wants - to have safe, fulfilling, peaceful lives. Unfortunately some elements have used this idea as a signal that it's ok to victimize and attack asian people and businesses.

It's a complicated topic. Most of the detractors in this sub to the black lives matter movement are not against the idea that black people don't deserve to be killed in the street, however respect is a two way street I think most of us would wish for some of that respect in return."
5,gxqact,"I cant even with asians who say that black people do not support us so we shouldnt support them. Fuck that, the fact someone snarks on asians doesnt mean they deserve to be literally murdered. 

It is time to stand up for each other. When it is our turn to fight against something, then we call out other POCs who dont support us. For now we show up for our black friends who need our solidarity."
6,gxqact,"When Vincent Chin was murdered, Jesse Jackson stood with us. Pitting us against the black community makes it harder for both of us to fight for our rights. Yes, there are Asians who are racist against black people. A lot of them actually. And yes, there are black people who are racist against Asians. Also a lot of them. But we have a choice to stand by each other when there has been clear injustice. And if we do, the barrier between us will start to crumble."
7,gxqact,"Although we dont have many prominent celebrities to speak out for asian Americans, we do have many journalists in reputable media sources that bring issues to light. Although some marginalize / whitewash the asian-american experience."
8,gxqact,Jesus christ yall will SCREAM about other minorities not supporting us when hate crimes during coronavirus were committed but when it comes time to practice what you preach with the black community suddenly it’s “Black people committed a lot of hate crimes against Asians” like ???

""In 1968, MSG’s death knell rang in the form of a letter written to the *New England Journal of Medicine* by Robert Ho Man Kwok, a Chinese-American doctor from Maryland. Kwok claimed that after eating at Chinese restaurants, he often came down with certain unpleasant symptoms, namely “numbness at the back of the neck, gradually radiating to both arms and the back” and “general weakness and palpitation.” After Kwok’s letter ran, the journal received a deluge of letters from other readers, all claiming to suffer from the same affliction, deemed “Chinese Restaurant Syndrome” by editors. Some readers presented the same symptoms as Kwok, but most were extremely varied, ranging from cold sweats to extreme dizziness. In response, the *Journal* offered up MSG as the likely culprit for their reader’s unpleasant symptoms.""  


I read a longer investigative article a while back that I can't find again now, but the TL;DR was that, due to this letter to this prestigious medical journal, later articles and research papers would refer to MSG or ""Chinese Restaurant Syndrome"" as a known, scientifically proven thing, and the footnote would reference the ""New England Journal of Medicine, Volume whatever, page whatever.""  Since nobody ever really bothers to look up the footnotes, it made it look like there was some actual study published in a top medical journal that showed that ""MSG-bad, CRS-exists"" was a proven thing, rather than just some unfounded speculation in the letters page.  Later papers or articles would then reference the secondary articles, but they were all built on that one initial unproven letter.

Most actual studies have failed to show that there is any correlation of MSG usage with the stated effects."

I wasn't even from China, I'm from Taiwan and he doesn't understand the politics and differences between the two and assumed they're the same. This kind of anti-asian bias is just hurtful."
3,mznqgj,"The anti-Asian hatred has always been deeply ingrained in the US' institution. Trump was just the catalyst that didn't care about spilling it in front of the media.

In Prof. Xi's case, [the Justice Department did not even understand the drawings they saw and never consulted any experts about the drawings](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/12/us/politics/us-drops-charges-that-professor-shared-technology-with-china.html). They *wanted* to catch a ""Chinese spy"" and bent the evidences to reach that conclusion, *for the sake* of catching a ""Chinese spy"". If this isn't a quintessential witch hunt then I don't know what is."
4,mznqgj,"This is particularly pernicious because the majority of the public will never know that many of these claims are baseless. If you are Chinese and accused of being a spy, you're pretty much guilty in the eyes of the public. See what happened to Wen Ho Lee over 20 years ago... things are only going to get worse in the current atmosphere."
5,mznqgj,"Remember when they put an entire race in internment camps for being ""spies."""
6,mznqgj,This is a serious problem for government employees or contractors that need some kind of elevated security clearance. I've also seen articles of people working in foreign relations/diplomatic functions express experiencing racism and discrimination for being Asian.  For some reason the decision makers of this country believe that it's more likely for Asians to commit espionage and sell government secrets than other races.
7,mznqgj,"So sad, we'll never be truly accepted as ""American"" 

Don't forget when Andy Kim congressman from New Jersey spoke about discriminations while he was in his government position as well

8,mznqgj,"Just a quick reminder, it was under the Obama administration in 2016 when they eliminated the words ""Negro"" and ""Orientals"" from federal laws. Just because the words are gone doesn't mean the sentiments are."
9,mznqgj,The FBI has regularly interrogated my family for the same reason. The anti Asian bent in law enforcement is very real.
10,mznqgj,"Reading a lot of the coverage about Chinese scientists getting harassed, I've been more than alarmed at how many reporters have normalized investigations into anybody with funding from the Chinese government. Sure, it MIGHT be part of an intelligence plot, but it might not be (and so might funding from a host of other countries with major geopolitical interests, including some American allies)."
11,mznqgj,Annoyingly. I think China somehow like this to happen so it can scoop back top talents. This is not helping us.

0,mwilhr,">""Perhaps the easiest to take on is to be shifting the narrative a little bit so that we, both individually and collectively, start seeing attacks against South Asians as anti-Asian hate,"" he said. ""When the Stop Asian Hate movement started, my hope was that now that we are recognizing the urgency around these issues and our shared experience, that when the next time something happens to the South Asian community that East Asians will show up and recognize that we're all in this together, and that really hasn't translated in this case.""

This is sadly very resonant with my experience as a South Asian-American. I’m glad these issues are being written about in a mainstream outlet & hopeful that we can build stronger bridges within the broader AAPI community."

0,mgh5bb,"here their English statement:

>We send our deepest condolences to those who have lost their loved ones. We feel grief and anger.  

>We recall moments when we faced discrimination as Asians. We have endured expletives without reason (lit. trans: *We were cursed at without any reason while walking on the street*) and were mocked for the way we look. We were even asked why Asians spoke in English.  

>We cannot put into words the pain of becoming the subject of hatred and violence for such a reason. Our own experiences are inconsequential compared to the events that have occurred over the past few weeks. But these experiences were enough to make us feel powerless and chip away our self-esteem.  

>What is happening right now cannot be dissociated from our identity as Asians. It required considerable time for us to discuss this carefully and we contemplated deeply on how we should voice our message.  

>But what our voice must convey is clear.  

>We stand against racial discrimination.  
>We condemn violence.

1,mgh5bb,Thank you BTS for speaking up
2,mgh5bb,BTS is the most globally prominent Asian music group. They made a statement and donation for BLM too. I am glad they can use their platform in a positive way.
3,mgh5bb,"I've been part of kpop fan community for over a decade at this point, and I was there when it really became more popular to non-Asians... And then came the fetishization, accusations of Asians trying to be Western, appropriation of Asian culture, and subtle racism everywhere.

I remember watching Psy's Gangnam Style when it was just released, and I got that sinking feeling. People were going to like it but only because they were laughing AT Psy. Psy is a good artist in his own way but he never achieved much success afterwards with his other english tracks, because everyone got their laugh and they moved on."
4,mgh5bb,"Can I just say that I find it rather sad and disappointing that it took BTS putting out a statement for some (non-Asian) Kpop fans to finally start paying attention to anti-Asian racism and violence, despite other Kpop stars such as Eric Nam telling people to please start listening and paying attention to anti-Asian racism and violence? And then I read from a user on r/kpop that [they saw tweets](https://old.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/mg55hl/bts_tweets_message_on_stopasianhate/gsrd2ap/) claiming that BTS took their time while other Kpop acts only wanted to ""join in on the trend"" like tf? How is wanting their own community to be protected against anti-Asian violence ""joining in on the trend""?"
5,mgh5bb,I’m glad to see international support for stopping Asian hate. Because everyone came out of the woodwork for Black Lives Matter and I haven’t seen that groundswell for Asians.
6,mgh5bb,"Once again I’m seeing the usual “everyone came out for BLM but not Asians.  Black advocacy in general has been around 400+ years. BLM is just a chapter in a long history of Black advocacy. Again, BLM, which many people always refer to, was not the commencement of Black advocacy; that started when stolen enslaved Black Africans chose the sea. People with ahistorical memories don’t get this and then complain about who came out for who without even recognizing how advocacy/organizing works nor doing anything to advocate/organize."
7,mgh5bb,"it's good that they spoke out but I'm very uncomfortable with the way people are treating it. bts saying something doesn't make the issue more legitimate, and the kpop fans prioritizing the xenophobia that a group of men who are otherwise extremely privileged in korea experience over the lived experience of asian americans is extremely uncomfortable to me

edit: added 'of' bc i have no grammar lol"

New York is the only state that doesn't allow judges to consider a defendant's threat to society in deciding whether to deny bail.  And now that cash bail is gone for most crimes, judges can't set higher cash bail amounts for ""dangerous"" defendants (which itself is a flawed practice, but an inevitable workaround).

When I was a junior at a mostly white suburban high school in Atlanta, Georgia (I was one of three minorities), a group of white kids ganged up on me and beat me up in one of the school's stairwells.

I remember people in this sub yelling at me for suggesting that the uptick in violence against asians had to do with white supremacy. Anti black sentiment does not help us. Looking to our oppressors (the cops) to save us will not help.

You have to have a credit card starting at age 18 with your parents to start building history. I started at the “late” age of 21 just cause I didn’t start making substantial money until then and my parents wanted me to get my own card. 

I own three vehicles and have paid off a loan for one, and I still get relatively uncompetitive interest rate offers from dealers simply because I haven’t demonstrated sufficient borrowing and payment history. I kinda get that but it also incentivizes more spending than I’m comfortable with. 

That being said, I have yet to find a friend of mine who is 27 years old and didn’t have a parent co-sign their home mortgage or didn’t take out a balloon loan to at least get their foot in the door for homeownership."

13,rctlz0,"Racism against Asians does exist, but could this also be related to citizenship status? The article and its source don't mention factoring in citizenship, but mortgage applications ask about your citizenship/visa/green-card status. A lot of Asians in the USA are on temporary worker status, like H1B visas. H1B visas are tied to employers: If someone on an H1B leaves their job, they need to get sponsored for a new visa by a new employer right away, or else they must leave the USA within 60 days (it's fucked up.) So their income is less guaranteed than the income of a citizen who makes an equivalent amount; it's harder for them to find new jobs (sponsorship is a hurdle for employers), and they might have to leave the country on short notice.

>Many big banks offer loans that visa holders qualify for, but upon risk assessment, visa holders will not be approved. The unfortunate truth of the situation is that mortgages are long loans–usually 30-40 years long–and the average H1B visa is valid for 3-6 years. Yes, renewals are possible and mortgages can be paid off early, but big banks are very risk-averse and lending to a person on a visa comes with a considerable amount of risk. https://www.stilt.com/blog/2019/09/h1b-mortgage/

The unfortunate reality is that it's so deeply ingrained into society and the minds of ALL people raised in those societies that it's a part of every single person's subconscious experience of the world. The title quote is true because racism is structural and institutional. 

Anyway, ""whitesplaining"" should be near the top. ""why don't they just  ___?"" or ""they should just ____"" are some of the most infuriating words to hear. 
""Why don't they just get over it? It was 70 years ago"" was a lovely piece of whitesplaining I heard in high school, a couple years before the US/California state government issued formal apologies for Japanese internment. Also something, something about how it was in part for Japanese people's own protection, which the history teacher told me to defuse me as I was about ready to punch that kid. 

See, it's not so hard to believe that same kid saying, ""why don't they just get over slavery? It was 150 years ago and they're free now."" If he's not saying it out loud, I can guarantee you that's what's in his head. That logic and verbiage is a wonderful way to shed any responsibility for inequalities that exist today ingrained into society centuries ago."

4,gtdss8,I’ve been posting a lot of support on my IG for Asians to support the black community. I’m gonna post this as well to show that many in the black community has a ways to go to rid themselves of anti-asian sentiment.
5,gtdss8,"There is a lot of misinformation and over-simipliciation going on in that thread, but I can't respond to every comment. Here is what I had to say in response to some of the media representation and model minority talk:

>I don't even see those news reports honestly. Do you know how many people didn't hear that a two-year old  and a six-year old were stabbed in Texas? Most people I talk to. I do  have a criticism of our country and the media but also Asians that  discourage going into public service or media: it takes issues like this  realize that economic advancement alone won't get treated like a human  in this country. Without political and media representation or getting the history books updated, they'll  continue to not advocate for your causes.  
>  
>Regarding  the economics, it's pretty nuanced: If white people fall on a bell  curve of wealth distribution and education, Asian Americans fall on a  double bell curve, where you have a lot of people doing well but also a  lot of people doing poorly and not a lot of middle class. (Think of all  the broke-ass businesses you see in movies.) This was exemplified during  the Silicon Valley boom, where you had Asians getting into tech but you  also had a lot of doing piece work making less than minimum wage. (Say  you have a group of ten people and one is a millionaire and the rest are  making minimum wage, the AVERAGE would actually look pretty good.)  
>  
>Additionally,  if we go deeper into phenomenon, like the so-called ""bamboo ceiling,""  Asians have good rates proportionally of employment, but the rate of  advancement in the workplace is the worst of any demographic. If you  control for college education, a white makes hundreds of thousands more  over the course of his career than an Asian."
6,gtdss8,Just a gentle reminder that you can express outrage over this without adding to anti-blackness.
7,gtdss8,"People trying to stir up hatred between Asian and black people in this subreddit. Don’t get distracted. Will there be black people who engage in anti Asian racism? Yes. But don’t forget that an Asian American cop watched while George Floyd died, too. You can’t blame a whole ethnicity for either.

In the end, it’s white supremacy that we need to dismantle. No justice, no peace."
8,gtdss8,"I feel for the guy. Because of how passive asians are brain washed to be, he can't even stick up for himself. I'm sure he was fighting hard not to lose his temper. I know i would have, but at the same time, maybe passiveness is rooted in me. At least the guy recording did us a favor and outed himself as a rascist."
9,gtdss8,"Videos like this are why a very large percentage of Asian Americans vote Republican. I have to say, it's a very effective propaganda video for the Republicans"
10,gtdss8,"As a Chinese person, this is difficult to watch, but imagine the pain of a Black person when they saw a Black person get strangled by a racist White cop. There are far bigger systemic systemic issues at play that urgently need to be addressed. I have heard Black people express frustration that Asians do not show up for them -- we need to address that and be present and support their struggle in any way we can."
11,gtdss8,They want us to unite with those who are racist towards us?
12,gtdss8,"La riots all over again. Asians need to arm themselves, not hope for the best from these angry mobs. 

Congrats to this clown for fueling the race war, and losing support for the cause from other minorities. I cared about the police brutality issue but now dont give af anymore. Im sure others agree.

Is the justice system broken, corrupt, and racist? Yes. Is the solution rioting and looting your local communities? No. But don’t expect the average trash human to behave logically."
13,gtdss8,"This same thing was cross-posted here yesterday, except with a purposefully inflammatory title.  

Just curious, what are your intentions posting this, OP?

---------------------------------------------

The context that many of us are aware of, is that White supremacy has interests to entrench divisions between Asian American and Black civil rights and human rights movements.  

At a time when we know the COVID19 racism proved our acceptance in American society is [conditional](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-04-22/asian-american-discrimination-john-cho-coronavirus), we don't get ahead by directing our hate toward those who the White people are also keenly interesting in oppressing also.  

Asian Americans will have more power, and are better served by dismantling the oppressive society and mechanisms that want to hold all their power and wealth through keeping everyone else distracted and fighting each other.

Right now the world has eyes and attention on the White supremacist culture that allows police to murder Black people.  That there are reddit brigades trying to distract from that is not by accident."

9,gzo7a0,"I agree it sucks that asian-owned small businesses are being screwed by the riots and looting that have been happening. However, I need to make it clear that the protests are inherently PEACEFUL. The looters are of different racial backgrounds, and it has nothing to do with anti-asian racism. They are opportunists, because they know the police aren't going to do shit to protect the small businesses, commonly owned by POC! 

Isn't it the job of the police to protect all people and businesses of looting and violence, instead of attacking the peaceful protestors? 

In the 92 riots of LA, the police fled Ktown to beverly hills, forcing Korean business owners to fend for themselves. Who's to blame here for not keeping peace and order? Where was the government aid to help the small businesses affected by looting and violence?

We can do both - support BLM AND support small businesses being attacked by looters and rioters (some of which are police in disguise). 

I am an Asian American in Los Angeles, parents of immigrants, and I am proud to support BLM. I was arrested in a peaceful protest, and that has not kept me from supporting and empathizing with the black community with the issues they face."

Don't play at recess, preferring to sit and talk? That's not behaving like the hive and you'll be humiliated in front of the class. Don't understand the lesson? Questions are one way tickets to being told to stand up and be yelled at. "
2,8gxtot,"I remember Chinese school being a huge waste of time, especially because they were Saturday classes. They don’t explain why or what the words really mean (coming from Cantonese) and somehow you were supposed to do workbook stuff on your own and you can’t even read what’s on the page. Weekly tests meant nothing other than showing your ability to cram sounds and strokes into your head temporarily because your parent didn’t realize you weren’t actually learning anything and you just wanted them off your back. 😑

Instead, I’ve picked up maybe more Japanese vocabulary passively through anime and games over the years compared to what I can speak in Cantonese."

4,8gxtot,I wonder how thoroughly Chinese culture has been shaped by having a such a difficult to learn written language.

I never had to go and oddly enough, I decided to slowly learn it on my own in my mid-twenties when I finally shed my internalized racism and embrace what is a far doper culture than anything you might find in America."
6,8gxtot,"I'm in this unique position where I can read and speak perfectly fine, but I've lost all my writing skills. It really painful to see 6 year old me write miniature essays in textbooks from when I went to school in China and knowing I won't be able to write that now. 

I was in the afterschool program portion of a chinese school, and my mom decided to enroll me into a chinese course, and since I can't write I was placed into the beginner's class. But I didn't like it at all because I was *so* bored do to knowing how to *read* them, and the class was focused on that. 

I also am in no hurry to relearn,  since everyone types in pin yin anyways. Even my parents are rapidly losing their proficiency."

I had stern and rude teachers, but also mellow ones that you could walk all over. I was never taught the importance of stroke order and I particularly still believe it doesn't make a difference if the end result is the same.

I was an on and off student because I would always refuse to continue. The last time my father tried to make me reconsider, I nailed that coffin shut for him when I brought up the fact that I speak more German than Mandarin, and at the time I had only had a semester of it versus years of Chinese."

0,qw4m5a,"Hello r/asianamerican !!

I'm Kenny Leu, an Asian-American actor. 

I'm the lead of A Shot Through the Wall, and I am absolutely THRILLED to have this film release soon. It's powerful, timely, and to me, what representation is truly about.

Popular movies like Crazy Rich Asians & Shang Chi have opened so many doors for us as a community. We can finally feel seen in the mainstream.

But this is the next step.

This next step of representation will be uncomfortable. We’re claiming our space. We’re having the difficult, honest conversations. Only through this tension with others will we not only feel seen, but understood.

I hope this film takes us a step closer to that dream!

My goal as an artist is to make films that create understanding for our community. This is just the beginning.

Jan 21, 2022. A Shot Through the Wall will be out in select theaters in the US & UK. Mark your calendars!

Love to you all,

Kenny Leu

PS This film does not have a blockbuster marketing budget, so it must rely on your word of mouth. If this was meaningful to you, spread the word! 

I'm also on IG @thekennyleu , if you'd like to stay updated."
1,qw4m5a,Looks good! When and where can we see it? Would love to support.
2,qw4m5a,"Hey Kenny! I saw your trailer, rewatched and rewatched and I can't get enough. You've really touched me with this piece and I wanted to share some thoughts  
  
No Asian comic relief characters, but serious drama of the complex intersectional world we navigate. No exoticism or superficial depiction of Asian culture, but a realistic and nuanced depiction of our culture and the value systems we navigate. No meaningless ""superpowers,"" but very real humans with complicated desires and character flaws (also Asian male romance story??!). 

  
This isn't Asian Representation, representations are just that, mere representations. This is Asian Inclusion (specifically Asian Male inclusion), the first step I've been truly waiting for in the long road to true social progress, the sincerest form of diversity and, finally, offering a candid piece around one of the last remaining underrepresented minorities in media.  
  
I look forward to your promising career, it finally made me feel like I belong in this world."
3,qw4m5a,Where is this being played? This is an awesome step for Asian American males in the right direction. Thank you.

14,qw4m5a,"As an Asian American in NYC, I followed the Liang/Gurley case very closely. While tragic, I thought it forced some good conversations about policing and interminority violence. Unfortunately, those conversations didn’t make for easy headlines, so the public didn’t get much benefit from them. 

A fictional take on those themes can go deeper. I applaud this effort and look forward to seeing this film. OP, please post here again when it hits theaters! We will spread the word!"
15,qw4m5a,Looks good man. Will definitely check it out if it’s my area.
16,qw4m5a,"I’m gonna make a weird prediction that the non-Asian cop was the one who shot them. Seems like it could be based on or inspired by a true story so I’m probably wrong.

Story: http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/2017/04/10/video-shows-man-forcibly-removed-united-flight-chicago-louisville/100274374/


Passengers were told at the gate that the flight was overbooked and United, offering $400 and a hotel stay, was looking for one volunteer to take another flight to Louisville at 3 p.m. Monday. Passengers were allowed to board the flight, Bridges said, and once the flight was filled those on the plane were told that four people needed to give up their seats to stand-by United employees that needed to be in Louisville on Monday for a flight. Passengers were told that the flight would not take off until the United crew had seats, Bridges said, and the offer was increased to $800, but no one volunteered.

Then, she said, a manager came aboard the plane and said a computer would select four people to be taken off the flight. One couple was selected first and left the airplane, she said, before the man in the video was confronted.


Edit:  There's more video...Per the Twitter account:

It's 2017, racism doesn't usually manifest itself in slurs and explicit laws. They don't target African American districts for voting restrictions. They limit voting hours on Sunday because that's when African Americans go to church. Come on guys."

I'm glad that one lady looked like she was yelling at the crew but I'm still a little unnerved that everyone just sat and let that happen.

Edit: I guess no one read my reply to bmorehalfazn below – I'm not sure I would do differently, and I was not advocating getting involved physically at all.

33,64iiy4,"The accompanying post on /r/videos was removed because they have a rule against videos of police brutality.  48k post karma, 10k comments.

https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/64hloa/doctor_violently_dragged_from_overbooked_united/

I wonder if they have this rule because people come to /r/videos for an assorted selection of video content, and they get flooded with police brutality videos because there are just so many incidences of police brutality every day.  If that's the case, I can understand the rule, I suppose.  But then it speaks to just how much of a problem police brutality is."
34,64iiy4,"Like some I think we can't say for sure there was racism involved in this, but the odds sure don't look favorable for United and the security involved.

One thing I find a little interesting is that there *has* been more discussion about the passenger's race than I expected in the media. I guess like a number of Asians I know of my first instinct was to think ""I wonder what would've happened if this happened to a black guy, the media would've gone bonkers."" However, the interesting thing is that from my observations most of the US media's talk about race concerns reactions in China. I mean sure China is a big market for United but part of me wonders if it's just easier to parse through Asians getting outraged when they're foreigners rather than as Americans. It's also easier to play up the China vs. America angle I guess, even though I've realized more and more thanks to our globalized world the lines are kinda blurring. Is there as much a difference now if the victim here was born in the US, came 40 years ago (as I've heard some media claim), came 4 years ago, a businessman who travels between Asian and US constantly, or was some random tourist or visitor?

38,64iiy4,"New update from the news conference with his lawyers & family: **David Dao’s Injuries: Attorney Describes Doctor’s Concussion, Trauma** [link](http://heavy.com/news/2017/04/david-dao-injuries-concussion-video-press-conference-tom-demetrio-doctor-united-airlines-passenger-dragged-removed/)

I think part of Dr. Dao's reaction after he got forcibly removed was that he was experiencing some PTSD that echoed his experiences with leaving Vietnam after the fall of Saigon in 1975. He didn't want to leave that flight like he didn't want to leave that boat that he escaped on. I know that some people (like my mom) don't like traveling on airplanes too so the seat-jacking just heightened his anxiety towards traveling. From the videos, it also looks like he wasn't seated next to his wife due to United seating policies. I feel like she could've helped calm him down somewhat, but it's still wrong that the aviation police & United acted this way.

42,64iiy4,"Every single passenger on that flight has a case to sue United Airlines for endangering their lives.  THis is because the passenger, while he could be denied boarding for any reason, was already boarded and was ""Refused Transport"" which has different criteria.  Rule 21 in the contract with United Airlines shows that he did not meet any of the criteria to be refused transport. ( https://www.united.com/web/en-US/content/contract-of-carriage.aspx#sec21 ).  As a result the situation of the violent assault and kidnapping of a law abiding citizen gave the citizen the right to use deadly force on the officers to protect himself by law (See Plummer vs State) thus endangering the lives of everyone on the plane.  I would suspect, those on the plane who were in fear for their safety have every right to sue the hell out of the airlines for illegally putting their lives a trisk."

Has great hard hitting quotes too:

> It's just funny hearing you talk about fair labor practices, considering where you come from.

> Just because I'm from the South doesn't mean I condone slavery.

> Maybe not, but it fed your family just the same, didn't it?

> Why pay for Irish labor when you can get three ch\*nks for the price of one? The regular working man is f*cked.

> Maybe you should take it up with the men who are doing the hiring instead of blaming the Chinese. Just trying to eat, same as everybody else."
1,ujuxwj,"Coming to Canada, the Chinese immigrants were crowded onto three-mast sailing ships that took months to sail from Hong Kong to Victoria. Food and water was limited and it was not uncommon for Chinese immigrants to die on route to Canada.


Newspapers at the time were racist towards the new Chinese arrivals. Stories typically portrayed them as hostile, while also implying that Chinese workers were taking jobs from Canadians because they accepted lower pay. The Port Moody Gazette wrote on April 12, 1884:

“The Chinese are beginning to encroach upon property in Port Moody, which should be kept free from them. If they obtain a foothold in the central part of the city, that neighbourhood will be rendered uninhabitable for white people and property will decrease in value. Necessity compels us to tolerate a few Mongolians in the community but let them herd themselves and not attempt to mix in with the whites.”

The inauguration of the first Transcontinental Railroad on May 10, 1869, in Promontory, Utah, was a transformative moment in American history. A dangerous journey that once took months could now be completed in a week, revolutionizing the fractured country’s economy."

&#x200B;

1. asian historical figures or culturally significant characters are white-washed so asian actors should be free to take on white roles. 
2. asian historical figures or culturally significant characters shouldn't be white-washed and vice versa.  

&#x200B;

I think both are just, morally speaking, and it's ultimately two different kinds of worldview and you guys can argue till your face is blue without convincing the other person. 

While I personally lean towards the latter, I still feel like the stories hollywood tells can be expanded to be more diverse. For example, I'm ambivalent about an asian bruce wayne (because I would hate it if white people made iono, 微微一笑很倾城 or 奋斗 or King's Avatar but changed the character's race) but I'd want the mantle of ""batman"" to be taken by an asian character like falcon took on Captain America's mantle in the comics.

Even G.W. Bush, complicit war criminal at best, was able to muster the leadership skills necessary after 9-11 and tell the nation not to attack muslims.

However time and time again Trump has proved himself to be a renaissance man born on opposite day and not only couldnt do the baseline decent human thing he's decided to scapegoat innocent people who are for the most part unused to physical danger and unable to protect themselves.

Asian-Americans not only have to worry about being infected by a virus that's killing fucking 30 year-olds with no previous medical histories, we now have to worry about our bad haircut with an orange tumor of a president actively setting the stage for people, **our own godamn countrymen and countrywomen**, to attack us."

He was beaten badly twice by a war hero that I viewed as someone better viewed as a war hero than President of the US. But many more Americans thought otherwise and voted him as President by huge margins.  But such was the start of my leaning towards Democratic candidates but not as a true blue follower as I did vote for the occasional Republican candidate if I thought him the better person for that office.

1,44yong,"Jarred, thanks for taking the time to do this.  What's really terrifying about this story, to me, is that if things had been *just a little different* the truth would have never come out and you surely would be in prison with your name tarnished forever.

What if there hadn't been witnesses, or what if the witnesses didn't see the whole thing?  Or worse, what if witnesses were friends of Harper and sided with his fabrications?

I strongly suspect if there hadn't been any witnesses that corroborated your story, the outcome would have been very different and everyone would be hailing Graham Harper as a hero right now.  Do you agree?  Best of luck with everything."

5,44yong,What was last year like for you before the trial? 2015 must have been crazy and stressful.  I recall reading in the news the time you spent days debating going on trial or taking the plea deal.  3 months vs 12 years is ludicrous and shows that sometimes people in our system plead guilty because they don't think they'll win at trial.
6,44yong,">I am not looking to sue Graham because I want to move on with my life. Suing him would just prolong this drama. Also there is no pot of gold at the end of that rainbow, **he is a broke college student** and so am I which is why I am surprised he still has the civil case up

No, if you look this guy up on the internet now he's an American hero.  He's a soldier who was almost killed defending helpless American women.  Go ahead, look his name up and see what a hero everyone is painting him to be.  Now look up your name and you'll see mixed results.  Graham ""piece of shit"" Harper is gonna do just fine in his life.  He'll get an excellent job, his love life is gonna be spectacular, and who knows what's gonna happen with this civil case.  Meanwhile, you're struggling to get back into the same school that immediately sided with the ~~White people~~ ""American heroes"" and left you for dead.  And if you do get back into that shitty school and graduate, all of your future employees are gonna do background checks on you and search for your name.  At the moment you're not looking very good.

Brother, sorry to be so blunt.  Whatever you decide I wish you the best but I hope you reconsider going after everyone who caused you all this trouble.  The women who wanted to use you to show how tough they were and decided that you better do whatever the fuck they told you to do and that asshole who didn't really give a fuck what was going on or what the truth was and just wanted to beat you up to look cool in front of those women, and is now a goddamn fucking hero for it.  

If it's money you need to go after these pricks then come to us again.  I hope every Asian person here realizes that, as the one who brought us Jarred's story said, **this shit can happen to ANY ONE OF US.**  I'm Jarred Ha, you're Jarred Ha, even my sisters here are Jarred Ha.  There's plenty of Graham Harpers out there that can decide on a whim they want to use you to show off.  and it doesn't matter what the truth is or if the courts clear your name later.  ""Justice"" is gonna be ridiculously expensive and your reputation might still be unsalvageable.  Is this okay with everyone here?  Are we just going to let this happen?"

It's an injustice that they're delaying the process of getting you back on campus, especially since the trial is over, and the state awarded you. I'll definitely share your story, and send some emails around UW"

9,44yong,What can we do to help you bro?
10,44yong,"Hi Jarred,

I've read through this forum and several articles about your situation. I commend you for being a bigger person and trying to get your life together instead of pursing legal action. One of the main points of your reason to not sue is because you believe there isn't a pot of gold at the end of the ordeal. However, I beg to differ.

I think you have a case to sue UW Pike chapter, UW, the rugby girls, as well as Graham himself. Graham himself is being greedy by pursuing a civil lawsuit against you. He is suing you not because he thinks he is right but probably because he knows you have insurance. He lied in court, threw in a racial slur, and has the audacity to sue you. He is simply not sorry and not enough of a decent human being to accept the consequences of his actions. Someone like him does not deserve our tax dollars. You mentioned he lied during trial and he had to apologize for so. You have court evidence of him lying and defamation. I agree with a previous post that you should sue UW Pike chapter for defamation as well. Now, the UW Pike chapter would have estate for you to sue. They were basically using their reputation to slander you on Instagram; in fact isn’t that cyber bullying? 

Based on articles stating you deliberated for days weighing pros and cons before deciding to go to court, you are a very logical person. Sit down and think about the cards in your hands. You basically wasted a year of your life because of this ordeal. You were suspended and had to place your studies on hold. If you took out loans I am sure the interest accrued. You lost a valuable year of your life because of false testimonies. Think about the emotional anguish you had to endure. But if you still think of taking the high road, I commend you.

16,44yong,"Hi Jarred,

You mentioned that Graham Harper lied about the facts of the case. Can you give us your story and elaborate on how they misrepresented the facts?"
17,44yong,"Hello Jarred!  First off, I'm ecstatic for the joy and relief you must have felt with the conclusion of your legal saga; justice prevailed and you can look forward to getting your life back on track.

However, I cannot help but feel rage again after thinking about the circumstances of your ongoing story.  Other users in this AMA have suggested continuing to aggressively pursue redress in civil court, and correct me if I'm mistaken, but you, understandably, have been through a lot and are still equivocal about further ""drama"" and want to put this behind you.

I get it, I really do - you've just won a massive battle upon which your life hung in the balance, and that must have taken much sweat, tears and energy, and you don't think you have much left in the tank, especially with your immediate concerns about getting back to school.

But I really hope you listen to this next part - make no mistake, justice prevailed in your case **despite** the system, not because of it.  I'm sure you realize that the only reason you are not a felon in prison right now is because the stars aligned and you had upstanding neutral witnesses.  The fact that a non violent, innocent Asian man almost got railroaded by the media, prosecutors, police, and most of all, a lying, racist drunk frat bro chasing down what seemed to him an easy beating should not be lost on anyone here.  **You should never have been put in the position of having to choose between lying to accept a lesser but still severe punishment or literally gambling with two decades of your life by going to trial.**  The fact that they are now, beyond all pretense of hubris, attempting to sue you is insult to injury.  **The message is clear - he is not sorry, and in his eyes, you are a lucky Asian boy who did not take the beating like you were supposed to.**

If you were not armed, or had your head been struck in a different manner that night, we quite possibly would not be having this AMA right now, but instead be reading a Wikipedia entry on another Vincent Chin case.  

I am not going to hide my intentions with this post.  You have already shown much courage and resilience, my friend, but **I ask you to think long and hard before sweeping this under the rug and letting bygones be bygones.  Imagine you have a daughter or son in the future, and they find themselves in a similar situation, facing down injury, death, or lengthy prison terms for not only defending themselves, but having to do so because the society they live in has implicitly stated that Asians are safe, easy targets.**  I am a doctor, so if money is an issue, I am more than willing to  significantly help you on that front.  

Ultimately Jarred, what I am saying is that I hope you choose to send a message to this asshole who so very nearly got away with assault and framing you, and is currently getting away with causing your life great difficulty and turmoil.  This message is not only for your own behalf, but for your fellow Asians and your future children.  "

24,44yong,"Hi Jarred, you have no idea how much of an inspiration you are to me. I admire your courage and bravery in the face of all this disgusting legal and racial ramifications.

26,44yong,"I understand that you want to move on with your life and this has been a horrible ordeal, but I hope you reconsider and bury these motherfuckers in future legal proceedings.  That they get off scot-free is why things like this happen in the first place.         

In the meantime I've sent some choice inquiries to UW (my alma) about how they handled your situation."
27,44yong,"I am working on a book about armed self-defense, and your case fits many of my working suppositions.  

First, I'm very glad that you were found innocent, but a criminal case is horrible situation no matter what happens.

Every municipality reacts differently to armed self-defense cases, and I believe the Seattle authorities would not react sympathetically.  I don't think I need to explain the many complexities, but this is certainly an unique combination.  

I'm afraid that you will never get your life back to the way it was.  I was looking at the Duke Lacrosse case, and there was prosecutorial malfeasance which resulted in an enormous settlement for the expelled students.  I believe there was enough evidence for a criminal trial, even if your accusers were so biased that they were untrustworthy.

I hope you will be able to move forward with your life.  "

40,44yong,"Hey Jarred, I know I'm pretty late to the party but I just wanted to tell you that going to court took a lot of balls. I'm really glad you stood up for yourself. I hope everything works out for you.

 You're a real inspiration!"
41,44yong,"Hello fellow Seattle person, I read about your story and I'm sorry you and your family had to go through this.  I'm pulling for you to get back into U Dub. Warm wishes from Bellevue, Jared. "

43,44yong,"Thank you Jarred for writing to all of us and sharing your experiences. I'm terribly sorry for what happened to you and the derailment of your life. You sound like you a remarkably good head on your shoulders despite everything that happened to you and I have no doubt that you will continue to have a bright future. 

This is addressed to the forum and to you, is there anyone here you might be interested in working on a template letter to contact UW and the King County Prosecutor's office so that we may sign them (with our real names) so that people can know that this sort of blatant injustice will not be swept under the rug? "
44,44yong,"Jared, hi 

Your case reminded me of something I saw watching the Forensic Files.

Did your [lawyers know about this case?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8SE2km9fkE)

Forensic files, season 9 ep 15. It was a wrestler who attacked another guy. The guy on the ground defended himself by pulling out a pocket knife and stabbed his attacker in self defense. The jury did not believe him, but he was tried a second time and his lawyers managed to prove he was only defending himself.

Anyways I'm glad you're ok man. I also carry a knife on me at all times, after many racially motivated attacks. I always fear I have to use it someday as it would appear pretty bad in court. I used to carry a pepper spray but it's useless where I live because of the heavy rain + wind

"
45,44yong,"Someone who knows SEO should help this guy out. We should make sure the top 3 search results for Graham Harper (idiot attacker) aren't idiot local journalists calling him a fucking hero.

I'd be willing to help out anyway I can."
46,44yong,"Hey man, I only recently read about the stuff you went through. I'm a UW grad school alum, and it kills me to read how my alma mater handled your situation. I'll send out an email to the UW Alumni Association with my thoughts on how they handled your case. Head up man, you got my full support!"
47,44yong,"Can you please post the email addresses of US and Prosecutor's office? It will make it easier for us to send them.

Also anything specific we should mention in the emails?"
48,44yong,"Any further questions? It claims your attacker Harper was inebriated? Do you know if your other attackers were as well? You seem like a very forgiving person and it is possible they were so drunk that their memory was plastic enough that they believe their own BS. Not evil people per say, just well, human. "

I do wish the best for you and honestly you should do a GOFUNDME account or something similar to help get back some of your court expenses.  It will get better and life will return to normal, just keep fighting for it until that day comes.  I hope your family are recovering and have a happier Chinese New Year."
55,44yong,"hey Jarred,

I'm little late to this news, but I am very glad you were proven innocent. Just like others have pointed out, the whole matter could've gone the other direction and your life could be in a much worst shape.

I can't blame people will blatantly lie about what happened, and how UW handled your case is just wrong. I hope they get more public trashing for what happened."

Why does this post keep getting deleted?"
58,44yong,"I was involved in a eerily similar situation where I was attacked by two men completely unprovoked. After trying to get away from them I also used a knife in defense and retreated ASAP. Didn't even have the chance to call 911 before I was arrested at gunpoint and locked up. The next morning I was in front of a judge for arraignment on 2x assault with a deadly weapon & intent to cause bodily harm charges. I felt the same way [Jarred] must have felt, that I was guilty until proven innocent. Luckily I did not get thrown out of college but I did lose my job and a large swath of my social circle due to some inaccurately written news articles and posts. I ended up with a clean record but $50k in debt from lawyer and medical treatment fees. I still worry that old, misleading news articles will cost me a job opportunity someday just because a google search indexes all those news posts will portray me in a bad light."

"
63,44yong,"So, one question I would have is,

given the overwhelming facts in your defense, and given at least some public support for you, Jarred Ha, 

would you or the public that supports you also support revising the laws that prohibit carrying dangerous weapons, including knives, concealed?

Because, you might have been charged or you might not have been charged, but it seems to me that you broke RCW 9.41.250 on the concealed carry of dangerous weapons.  Now, I think what you did was right and that the law is wrong--I am not saying what I say to accuse you.  I think we need to change rcw 9.41.250!"

65,44yong,"Is there a reason that you folks have been silent on the topic of laws regulating knife carrying such as the knife that Jarred used in self-defense?  Do you folks think those laws are good or bad?  And, if they are bad, why are my posts on the topic not going through?"

OP said: 


>A friend sent it to me. It’s CCTV footage. The video has been circulating in the Chinese community and they were telling people to be careful.

...

>The thing about Chinese people is that they don’t want ""trouble”. The suspect knows exactly where the lady lives now because he scouted the area and actually sat next to her door. Chinese mentality is like this. They’d keep the pain to themselves rather than making a big scene.

1,fw7f1m,"So awful. The burns from an acid attack stay with you forever. I hope she is getting care and support. The article doesn't say anything about the victim being Asian, but please watch the footage in the linked thread if you can; it is very disturbing. It is clear that the victim is an Asian woman. Another case of the hate crime element in crimes against Asians being obscured in the mainstream press.

Some people in the linked thread are saying it's strange that he waited for her, but unfortunately we have seen multiple cases where neighbors specifically sought out Asians they knew lived in their community to harass or attack. This is also why we need law enforcement to take these crimes seriously so that the full context of the crime can be known and the perpetrators can't hurt anyone else. Also, there's clearly an element of racialized violence against women here. The vast majority of acid attacks are perpetrated by men against women. Part of the assailant's motive is to disfigure the victim's appearance. Notice how he goes for the head/face. Asian women are three times more likely to be victims of hate crimes. These racists are pathetic. I hope they catch this guy and send him away for a long time."

When Dean Balsamini first “interviewed” me, he did not tell me what this was about until after I disclosed most of my background. He did not include in his article that I started crying on the phone when he finally did tell me what he was inquiring about. He did not include that he played this “friendly guy” reporter who just wanted to get MY side of the story, since ya know, they were gonna run it anyway, with or without my input.

my guess to what happen, this white boy is trying to be alpha and walk straight on the street, and not moving to the side whenever an elder is pushing a cart and walking opposite his direction and him not moving out of the way. he is delibrately trying to get hit by other asian elders who lack mobility and then swings a fist at them because hes so alpha. hence why a grandpa also got beat up by this same fucking guy.

tldr; he's purposely walking into asian elders in chinatown and swinging a fist in retaliation. and he's in his fucking 30s. imagine this is the type of shit you do in your 30s. drop dead please"

2,t3sat4,White privilege is a real thing even in geopolitics. Russians are accepted into white society so they don’t get lumped in with the government for any wrongdoings. CCP does something wrong and suddenly everyone from the Asian diaspora has a target ton their backs. Same thing happens with immigration too. A white person from some Slavic or Baltic country can live in the US and not be scrutinized while an immigrant from Mexico gets question to death about their legal status.
3,t3sat4,"Lol of course not. People couldn't even distinguish between Sikh-Americans and Saudi fundamentalists in the wake of 9/11. The last time US was in direct conflict with a major Asian power (Japan and WWII), Chinese Americans had to label themselves saying they were not Chinese to avoid discrimination."
4,t3sat4,"I think about this semi-frequently as a Chinese person, enough to remind me to continue prioritizing family and friends first, trying to combat issues impacting those of Asian descent and passively maintaining a healthy distrust of others on any matter that isn't surface-level.

Western society, including other Asian groups, will never accept or defend people like me. It's more likely they'll applaud whatever measures are implemented to destroy us under the guise of ""national security"" (China Initiative, hello?) 

Thinking that being successful in a prestigious career, serving in the US military or anything else worthy of """"""respect"""""" will equip one with a pass is naive, to say the least. Believing that cultural capital will save you from what is going on is simply an express ticket to letting your guard down and getting blindsided when you are inevitably targeted.

Also, placing any faith in other groups (or even other individuals of Chinese descent, given the abundance of people who actively denigrate their own heritage and defiantly proclaim they're ""not like the others"" -- hint, this ain't gonna work) to respond to injustices inflicted against people like me is a fool's gamble, even though I wish it wasn't.

If China ever tries anything egregious then I fully expect to be targeted. It's human nature to be tribalists, ingrained all of us, something like this is inevitable. One of the most reviled countries from a Western POV doing something will almost certainly flip the switch in everyone who hasn't already boarded the dehumanization train. Would not be surprised in the slightest if I spent some period of my life in an internment camp in the future due to an erupting conflict.

Something similar already happened to me when Covid was first in upswing (violent physical altercation), so I expect to be brutalized frequently in a similar, if not more severe fashion when the situation deteriorates. Notice I said ""when"", not ""if""."

0,ngzpp5,"I tried to read the bill and here's what I think it does. Of course it might not be executed well. Please read it yourself too and let me know if I missed something.

https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/937/text

As far as I can tell it:

* Establishes some details about increased hate crimes during COVID-19, including naming the victims of the Atlanta shooting
* Calls for the AG to name a DOJ officer to expedite a review of hate crimes
* Tries to increase hate crimes data collection and coordination between different agencies
* Grants to assist agencies in hooking up to national reporting systems and to create state-run hate crime reporting hotlines
* Grants to agencies for training, to help analyze and report hate crimes and establish community relationships to local organizations and to hold public meetings on hate crimes
* Requires the AG to collect and analyze all the data quantitatively and qualitatively and submit a report to Congress yearly
* Allows courts to sentence someone who committed a hate crime to do community service in the community that they harmed

I'm generally skeptical about adding more programs and I can see why some people think this just an opportunity for law enforcement to get free money. I think it's important that the Atlanta victims are named and recognized and I think more hotlines and community outreach is a good thing. I also like the idea of making people do their community service for the people they hurt."

8,ngzpp5,"Today’s speech by Biden was good, but the bill seems like smokescreen to mask the the root causes/motives of hate crimes. Especially between Blacks and Asians, that predates COVID.

There certainly appears to be a strong correlation that since March 2020, when Trump began his Anti-China COVID rhetoric, there’s been more attacks on Asians by Blacks, but is there evidence of causation?

Has there been any evidence that assaults against Asians by Blacks is directly tied to Blacks blaming Asians for the year-long COVID hardships? Or have any of the attackers cited Trump as the reason they targeted Asians specifically?

It all seems a bit muddled with no focus on preventing these crimes from happening, but to only prosecute/track the cases after the fact.

What efforts by the Black community are there to denounce hate crimes by their own against defenseless Asians? Shouting, “it’s because of White Supremacy” doesn’t seem authentic and gives the impression that white peoples are committing the majority of the physical assaults on Asians, and gives Blacks a free pass to continue their hateful acts.

Also, was the shooting spree in Atlanta determined to be a hate crime by a White against Asians for COVID? Or was the motive something else? This is by far the most heinous hate crime this year and should be front and center since all the victims were Asians."
9,ngzpp5,"I don't think we should be celebrating legislation that only expands law enforcement/policing while failing to address the root societal drivers behind the issues we face not even a year after the George Floyd protests. There are [a lot of people and groups who have major concerns about this act](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/why-over-85-asian-american-lgbtq-groups-opposed-anti-asian-n1267421), and we shouldn't take it at face value just because the politicians are saying it's ""to address Asian hate"".

Furthermore, what gives Joe Biden the right to speak on Asian violence when he used Sinophobic ads during the presidential campaign and continues to support an apartheid regime's continued violence against brown Palestinians? I swear, some people are so quick to become bootlickers as soon as the oppressors are blue instead of red."
10,ngzpp5,"Please also help asians by telling Americans that asians of all nationalities are not a threat to the American way of life, unlike how Biden portrays China to be in every speech he gives. We all know Americans don't care about what nationality asians actually are as long as they are somewhat similar to the perceived ""other"" that threatens their country,  hence why we see attacks against Filipinos and Koreans even though these nations have nothing to do with covid 19 and are our allies, much like how we saw increased attacks against the Sikh community after 9/11. Please speak out against the Biden administration trying to propogandize us into a third world war with China, because even though Biden isn't as forwardly racist in his speeches as Trump was, he still holds the same racist American global domination intent that Trump had for instilling fear in the American people, and asians of all nationalities will pay for these actions."

18,p1e7h4,"Bay Area being its “WoQuE” self because “racism against Asians isn’t actually racism because you’re not real people.” Literally leaving my 17 year career, all in Alameda County, because literally segregating Latinos into a back room to ignore and making Asians the actual, not hyperbolic, *house slaves* of the white and Black residents, *including pregnant, disabled, and elderly Asians,* refusing AsAms care, brutalising AsAms and LatAms, is all “AnTi-RaCiSt AcTuAlLy” and “PrOgReSs.” 

My first social work job was out that way, and considering what I see west of the hills, I didn’t expect it’d moved beyond this sort of thing. 

I actually feel like what you get for learning English is 1112848840 BOTTOM RUNG WITH NO ADVANCEMENT FOR OUR KIND job opportunities—outside of STEM, but even in, you’ll always be under some ignorant monolingual with 0.03 functional brain cells, and in STEM? Probably young enough to be your kid! Outside, not always, but may be actually illiterate in his only language, but it’s English, so he’s considered by everyone and brags about being smarter than you, an accented immigrant who speaks four fluent languages (have studied three more, can get basic things sorta communicated in Mandarin and Cantonese, not so much Swahili or Standard Arabic, I can also read Cyrillic Russian alphabet, and get some basic phrases in Russian and Romanised Serbo-Croatian out of, say, a Wikipedia article in them) with a college degree while he can’t spell “towel” in his only language. Everyone around says it’s not racist because it’s your priveledge to have faced violence every day of your life since you came here, including at home until you just stopped living with other people for 23 years, lose your romantic attraction because all people ever want you for is DV and extortion and “owning a Japanese,” even if you did face violence, which they can just deny literally the entire last 27 years of your life, it would be your fault and that’s not racist because you’re Asian so it doesn’t count. 

Japantown Oakland is no more. Chinatown Oakland has been getting pieces shaved off it and everyone run out since the ‘60s. My church has a really cool story about being moved in the middle of the night before it was gonna be demolished back then, but gentrification has been happening to us DECADES before it happened to people anyone cares about. Try to find a massacre of Asians (usually Chinese who were replacements for slavery, and that should tell you something), in California between 1860s and 1920s and you’ll have Wikipedia asking you “which one? Because we have a lot of those.” The one in 1871 was THE *largest mass lynching in history,* clearly such a priveledge/s 

Cops who didn’t kill you outright (see Angelo Quinto in Antioch, and how literally zero non-Asians cared because he was The Wrong Race. He died near Christmas, same way as Floyd, IN FRONT of his panicking mother. No one cared at all. Clearly, much progressive/s) they’ll laugh at you reporting a white partner for racially motivated DV *armed murder attempts* because they have “real problems to take care of,” and I’m still suffering in run-down box with most of my stuff in storage where anti-Asian hate crimes happen all the time and I have watched police gaslight victimised Asians *this year.* 

Remember Laney College student Phuc Bui? Yeah, I went a looooong time before her, and it was the same. Half of Chinatown was bulldozed to build it—place is literally *built* on anti-Asian racism. 

The Bay Area has been virtue signalling forever. It’s just a new word. The Bay Area, and California at large, has had it down pat for longer than most people alive now have existed. 

The one reason Asians should live here, though, is there’s more of us and there’s Asian communities to retreat into. I can’t even fully say “plenty of resources by and for us” because I’m Japanese, and Japanese or Korean resource availability 100% depends on who young “AmErIcAnS” today are fetishising. Not actually whether or not these are wanted or needed by actual Japanese/Korean immigrants or descendants thereof. 

So, yeah, this is totally California’s true face."

&#x200B;

Considering how poorly Asian men are portrayed in Hollywood, I was genuinely surprised to learn about Sessue Hayakawa, a Japanese actor who became one of the biggest stars during the American silent era of the 1910s.He became one of Hollywood’s first sex symbols after starring in the film, The Cheat (1915) in which he plays a cruel villain (there’s a scene in which he literally brands a woman). Despite his portrayal, Hayakawa became extremely popular with American women for his “broodingly handsome” good looks. At one point, he was the highest paid actor in Hollywood (making over $3,500 a week), and his fame was on par with that of Charlie Chaplin.Although, Hayakawa was highly sought after during the 1910s and early 1920s, he became disillusioned by constantly being typecast for the same roles. He decided to start his own production company to fight Asian stereotypes and ended up producing 23 films in a span of three years. However, he had to scrap his company after getting into an argument with a distributor who called him a racial slur.By the 1930s, Hollywood had set strict moral guidelines called the Hays Code which prohibited interracial love to be portrayed on screen. As a result, Hayakawa continued to be cast as either a villain or a “forbidden lover” since most of his costars were white women.In 1937, Hayakawa went to France to star in a French film, but ended up being trapped in the country when World War 2 broke out. He sold watercolor paintings to financially support himself and joined the French resistance to help fight the Germans.In 1949, Hayakawa—upon reflecting on his career—mentioned, ""My one ambition is to play a hero"".He never really got that chance but did end up being nominated for best supporting actor for his role in The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) in which he plays an “honorable villain” in charge of a Japanese prison camp in Thailand.Upon retirement, Hayakawa became a Zen master and dedicated his life to Zen Buddhism. He died at the age of 87 in 1973."
1,vlmsm2,"Before white America and Hollywood began its smear campaign against Asian American men because we were a 'threat to white women'.

Honestly amazing how the effects can still be seen as recently as movies like The Hangover in 2009."
2,vlmsm2,"When it comes to race, it's patently clear that the people we are attracted to depends  so much on who we are exposed to, especially perhaps through media. Yet, there are still countless people (including many Asians sadly) who have internalized this racist ideology that white people are the most attractive because of genetics.  

So what about the countless millions from all around the world who believe that Asians are as beautiful as anyone? Is there something wrong with us? Ask BTS fans who the most attractive men are. Is there something wrong with them?

Sessue Hayakawa definitely deserves a biopic. It'll be fitting that he'll be the hero in a film about his own life. But Hollywood is still deeply racist in many ways, so I won't be holding my breath anytime soon."
3,vlmsm2,"He's also covered in one segment of the 2006 documentary film ___The Slanted Screen___, produced and directed by Jeff Adachi, about Asians in American film and TV."

0,gs14wc,"I've been reading up on this and it's apparently even worse than the article makes it seem (which is already pretty fucking bad):

- The family claimed therapy for their son was ""too expensive"" but were happy to undertake a complete home renovation

- They duct taped his fingers together to keep him from sucking his thumb. Meanwhile there are videos/pics of their older bio-children sucking their thumbs without reprimand.

- The mom posted in adoption groups asking about what kinds of special needs ""look hard to manage but are actually easy""

- They placed Huxley in foster care (not a second adoption like they claim) and then went on vacation like nothing happened"
1,gs14wc,"Reading this article made me so sad. The fact that this woman glamorized and monetize her adoption of a Chinese baby boy just to re-home him to another family like a freaking pet is unbelievable. I can’t imagine how hard it was for baby Huxley to adjust not once but twice. I hope he’s a lot happier and safer with his new family,  no child deserves parents who parade them for money and get rid of them when things get hard."
2,gs14wc,Video adsense that contain Huxley needs to go to Huxley and his care.
3,gs14wc,"Unfortunately these people are characteristic of too many transracial international adoptive parents. There are some white adoptive parents in the US who see adoptees as signifiers of how they are ""good people"" who are ""saving"" an Asian child and do not see their adopted children as full people. They usually have religious motivations. Notice how this couple keeps invoking God as if that ""absolves"" what they did. This is why they ""re-home"" these children like commodities without any introspection into what they are doing.

Also, unfortunately, it is coming into light in recent years that some adoptees from China who were said to be orphans or abandoned were actually kidnapped or otherwise trafficked. Obviously I am not saying Huxley was, or that this is all the fault of adoptive parents, rather that these parents drive demand for these children who they have zero racial and cultural competency in raising. Please listen to the stories of transracial AsAm adoptees. No, not all of them have negative experiences, but the ones who did are often silenced and accused of being ""ungrateful."" Huxley and other AsAm transracial adoptees who have become cogs in America's international adoption machine are part of our community too."
4,gs14wc,"This made me so sad. What if one of their biological children were autistic and had behavioral issues? Would they also re-house that child? I’m bipolar and gave my parents hell as a teenager. I once asked my dad if he regretted adopting me and he said no, he was my dad for life. He said there was no guarantees that his biological child wouldn’t have the same issues. That’s what family is about."
5,gs14wc,"Wow. I followed their family channel due to Huxley’s adoption but I guess I won’t be following it anymore. His disappearance from their videos did have me suspicious but I didn’t think it’d be like this. They knew he had developmental issues (amongst other things), this isn’t brand new information. But I guess it was just too much for them. :/ damn.

I forgot to say, I hope and pray that Huxley’s “new family” loves him like their own and is able to provide the care that the Stauffers couldn’t.. :(

Edit: I just watched the video. “His new mommy” my god. And I hate the word “re-home”."

10,gs14wc,"I really despise anyone who thinks adopted children are like things you buy off the shelf of Target and can be returned if you wanted. On the other hand, adoption agencies should always be transparent about any medical/behavioral issues any children have."
11,gs14wc,Custody transfers are very underregulated and predators regularly gain custody of children like this. Adoptive parents often post to online groups to get rid of their kids and frequently transfer custody to total strangers.
12,gs14wc,"As someone with an older brother who's Autistic, I've watched the struggles my mother has endured? to raise him. I don't doubt that the boy was difficult, and that to some extent the family has dealt with a lot, and hopefully tried all methods. But like... it's their fucking child. Would they give up one of their bio children if they had autism? Like you adopted a child, now you live with trying to give it the best life you can, and it seems so ridiculously selfish to want to give up child because they're causing problems in their instagram caucasian lives."
13,gs14wc,"If you want to vomit, go read her IG comments and all the white Christian mommy bloggers defending her... yikes!"
14,gs14wc,"At the same time I’ve gotta say it can be very difficult, raising children with special needs especially if you recognize you’re not prepared.  Sometimes as much as you prepare, it may not be enough. There are things we don’t see off screen.    And I REALLY hope they tried every literal thing, fought tooth and nail, before ending on this heavy decision that can be full of hurt.

Whether the reasons that Huxley (I seriously hate that name btw lol but w/e) went to another home are legitimate or not, I think she should remove all videos that were monetized or anything that profited off of Huxley... perhaps funnel the money that was gained to the family with him. 

and this brings into discussion the monetization of vulnerable populations such as children or children with special needs on YouTube. Should this be occurring?"
15,gs14wc,"They haven’t said it yet...I wouldn’t be surprised if some part of the reason is because of COVID19/associated racism that they might be experiencing.

They are disgusting hiding behind their faith. And they gave him up to **foster-care**. 
They need to be pressured to remove all monetized videos about their “self ego stroking”, adoption process going back two years. 
Sick."
16,gs14wc,"It's actually really common for white Americans to adopt or foster Asian babies because they look ""cute"" only to abandon them when they got older, not unlike with kittens or puppies. Following the Vietnam War it got so bad that the US basically had to impose ""blind-race"" adoptions so people couldn't exclusively shop for Asian toddlers."

3,jl430b,"Unfortunately, what happened to Amara was not unique. Like the reporter mentioned, racially charged incidents towards Asian Americans are increasing as the American public buys into anti-Asian rhetoric under the Trump administration. Not unlike the anti-Muslim sentiments and hate crimes triggered by 9/11, the American public has found another group to place the blame of the current condition.

Many times, the microaggressions or racial incidents we as Asian Americans face are related to the perpetual foreigner stereotype that posits we are perceived as less American than someone of a white racial background.

Here are a few relevant resources for how to respond to incidents like what Amara experienced so that we don't simply enable ""othering"" and marginalization (not to say that there must always be a physical response to a given incident):

6,jl430b,God this was painful to watch. This shit is institutional and we need to throw our political and financial weight around to stomp it out.
7,jl430b,"It's a good thing there's a pandemic out there so I'm not missing much because I don't want to go outside. I really only go outside to bike and get groceries. I don't have an overwhelming fear but there is this subconscious fear that I have of encountering a racist like this. I feel the need to project strength constantly by standing and walking with good posture but it's so tiring.

I've done a couple of road trips in the past year and I've carried pepper spray with me any time I step out of my car."
8,jl430b,"Wow that cop backing up the racist aggressor is just horrendous. I didn't know Amara was Asian, but I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of Asian females are in journalist/media based jobs.

If you’re both speaking another language and one of you asked the other if they spoke English, not racist. If you need directions and you only speak English, it’s not racist to ask someone if they spoke English.

If you walk up to a random Asian and ask “do you speak English?”, it’s probably racist or at the very least prejudice; you’re assuming an Asian probably doesn’t speak English and/or that “an Asian” cannot be American.

If you want to know if someone Asian speaks English, just start a conversation in English! If they know it, they know. If they don’t, they don’t."

Not every Asian person has that, but some of us do, and Sophia herself said that she posted this for the many people out there who've had the same experience, who don't have the same platform she has. You can't just racially abuse Asians without consequences anymore. 

I remember the early days of YouTube, where a lot of Asian people dominate various categories, from beauty (Michelle Phan was *the* pioneer) to comedy. These creators got famous on YouTube because it was the only place at the time we could get that type of Asian American representation, and Asian Americans finally got a voice and a platform. This post is getting tons of traction and comments from other Asian and non-Asian content creators, and even Shaun King commented. The restaurant commented.

0,hhjds2,"Definitely depends on where you live. In California, state history covered the gold rush, Chinese railroad workers, Chinese exclusion act, and Japanese internment."
1,hhjds2,Absolutely. Making sure that our future generations know America's ugly history with asian americans is one of the most important steps in dismantling the model minority myth. It's inexcusable that many asians do not know much about their own history unless they've deliberately done the research outside of school. It's inexcusable that elementary school kids spend whole months on glorifying Colombus and maybe a day if they're lucky on AsAms.
2,hhjds2,"Agreed. The most I remember is perhaps from 5th grade with Japan’s involvement in WWII. As a Korean-American, I hardly remember any mention of Korea until US history with the Korean War. It wasn’t until college when I chose to take an Asian American History class that I learned more"
3,hhjds2,I didn't learn anything about AA history until college. It was such an eye opener that Asians have been in the US for centuries and had a substantial part in American history. It's really disappointing that this isn't taught early as part of the K-12 curriculum. Especially considering not everyone has the ability to go to college to learn about these types of things.

The school's classes were only an hour and a half long and the school was in session an hour after our regular public school let out for the day.  Besides studying the Japanese language, we also had sessions on history of the Asian-Pacific sphere.  During the war years 1941-1945 the school was closed as the teaching of Japanese in Hawaii's school system was discontinued. It reopened after the war to the protests of the non-Japanese population of Hawaii."

I remember that specifically because we did Wednesday, Thursday, and then quizzed on Friday. I didn't know much about the Korean War except from the perspective of what the US thought of it, and didn't know that Japan basically committed genocide (or any of the other genocides going on in the world, Amernia, Rwanda, etc).

And the APA ones - or even the APA ones who've matched every possible demographic category of my own - were not all great. But even so, I think I've had enough experience to say that, in general, white therapists tend to specifically not understand that a form of boundary setting with my family that completely writes them out of my life was not in the realm of possibility for me and that this possibility was not happiness maximizing / self-actualizing. This is explicitly not to say that boundary setting with family isn't an important issue with APA patients, but every white therapist I've ever had did not understand this."
2,t8wi2z,Yes! I'm a Korean Adoptee and found a Korean Adoptee therapist. It has been life changing. Cannot recommend this enough (even therapy in general).
3,t8wi2z,"Is your therapist APA?

Are they from an immigrant/bicultural family?

I find that even within the ranks of other POCs, I still prefer talking to people who have a bicultural/bilingual background. They seem to relate to my experiences more easily.

ETA: My questions are rhetorical, OP. I didn't mean to seem nosy. I just got excited."

6,t8wi2z,"So happy for you OP!! 

I started seeing a therapist last year only after I found a WOC therapist and it turns out she was Blasian so it worked out perfectly as she has a pretty unique perspective from being biracial.

If anyone's interested I used https://openpathcollective.org/ A friend recommended it because it's targeted to those who are not insured or have low-coverage insurance."
7,t8wi2z,"10/10 would recommend too. My therapist is a desi immigrant woman who is also a parent. I'm not an immigrant, but she spent a long time here. It is wild to be seen like she makes me feel seen as a third-party."
8,t8wi2z,"I've heard a mix of emotions from my AsAm friends who have had AsAm therapist. Some have said it wasn't that helpful because sometimes it felt like a friend who would say ""Oh ya, me too!"" or would try to justify certain behavior because they knew the immigrant/AsAm experience.  
I know for me, having a non-white therapist is so helpful. She's a Black woman, specializes in maternal health which worked out for me. And though she doesn't have immigrant parent background and isn't Asian, she's been amazing at listening and support and guiding me through my emotions."

13,t8wi2z,"Yeah I love mine, she's been wonderful and helped me so much in growing as a person and being warmer to those around me. 95% wonderful. My only gripe is that, as another Asian American, they might themselves fall into the same Asian ways of thinking that could be causing you pain. We all have our frameworks of thought. For example, the ""put your community before your self"" can manifest in a lot of subconscious ways. Just food for thought. Overall 95% I think it's perfect and you don't have to explain nearly as much."
14,t8wi2z,"I highly-recommend this as well! It's a shame that mental healthcare isn't accessible to  many, but for those who have access to such, it can be a major gamechanger. I have a therapist of the same ethnic background, and it was very healing to hear affirmations/validation from her as someone with mother issues."
15,t8wi2z,"Is he/she Asian? I'm curious whether there's a big difference in, say, Asian-American therapist who cannot speak his/her mother language vs. a Hispanic therapist who is bilingual and child of immigrants. I feel like in some ways, the latter might relate more, but in other ways the former might."
16,t8wi2z,"I've had non-White therapists and they were some of the worst therapists I have had. Just because they look like me doesn't mean they understand my background or experience.

I am superbly happy with my White therapist, but am glad to hear you found a helpful therapist! Finding the right fit is so hard!"
17,t8wi2z,"Congrats!

I tried therapy multiple times with white therapists, and I basically gave up on therapy. At the end of college, I was randomly assigned a Latinx therapist at my university's mental health center, and it totally chanced me on therapy. I've tried other white therapists since, but the only therapists I've been able to actually work with have been all PoC!"

That being said, there are very few absolute numbers given in this piece, so I approached this article with skepticism. Unless someone want to correct me, it seems [similarly-aged white Americans are committing suicide at a much higher rate than Asian Americans](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/suicide/rates_1999_2017.pdf) are. So if suicide is the leading cause of death among  young Asian Americans, to me that highlights how low the overall death rate of Asian Americans is compared to other groups."
2,mwux3f,"Is it the leading cause because it's higher per capita, or because other risk-taking behaviours are lower than in other demographics, i.e., fewer deaths from drugs/alcohol, violent causes, dietary morbidities, etc., pushing suicide higher up the ladder without it actually being more prevalent?"
3,mwux3f,"Mental health is taboo, that’s why. Asian parents will say mental illness is a 1) white/“other people” thing, 2) doesn’t exist because “it didn’t exist when they were young”, or 3) is only a lack of discipline and nothing more. 

Coupled with the fact that before the pandemic and the recent spate of attacks, there were few spaces dedicated to AAPI youth and their mental health. There are hardly any spaces for LGBT AAPI youth still. A lot of AAPI youth really only have religious spaces as a supportive network, and they’re not always the best."

6,mwux3f,"The model minority mindset of non-Asians who perpetuate a certain type of behavior and results from Asians and first-generation Asian cultural norms about mental health. 

The ""model minority"" stereotype promotes the idea that Asians, by default, should be academically elite and pursue STEM-related careers that provide a comfortable upper-middle-class livelihood. Asians are also expected NOT TO BE confrontational or in leadership positions and instead be more of a ""follower"" at their workplace.   


Asian culture itself is pretty indifferent or even hostile to the idea of ""mental health"" and especially admitting that you have problems and need help and assistance from external sources. I hate to admit it but that Asian ""stoicism"" and the ability to completely bear hardships while refusing help or sympathy for others is very true, especially amongst first-generation Asians. Admitting that you have mental health issues and need outside help is extremely emasculating for Asian males who see their ability to ensure hardship as a source of masculine pride. This is made worse by the ""model minority"" stereotype which praises Asians' abilities for ""enduring mental health problems alone"" as ""pulling yourself up by your bootstraps and not needing others' help."""

1,ugngtm,"For people who still somehow don't understand why going up to someone and saying a foreign greeting is racist and not ""being nice""-- It's because you're assuming they're a foreigner based on their looks. 

For the same reason you'd think it's bizarre to walk up to a white American and say ""Guten Tag"", even though German ancestry is the largest grouping in America or ""Witam"" because Polish is the second. Because you see white American as ""normal"" and Asian American as ""foreign and in need of identification"". 

The fact you explain it as ""we're trying to be nicer to show you we speak your language"" is making it that much worse because it just CONFIRMS that you think we're OUTSIDERS in our own country. If it wasn't for race, the base assumption should be that we're all American."

0,sc58r9,"We often seem to be reaching back a very long time ago when we bring up examples of solidarity and that is fairly disheartening.  Personally, the more I see people thoughtlessly repeat ""solidarity!"", the more disconnected I feel.  It is not surprising to me that Black-Asian relations are weaker nowadays.  Reciting worn out philosophical talking points doesn't change anything.  Hand-waving away any legitimate disagreement as ""white supremacy trying to divide us"" is disingenuous.  Jada Pinkett Smith admits on her talk show that the majority response from the Black community to #stopasianhate was apathy (""Why should I care?  They never did anything for me"").  I think it's okay to understand our relations are not as strong lately but hearing people deny it with ""we've always been together!!!"" is weirdly demoralizing for me."
1,sc58r9,Let’s not forget our shared struggles. The Asian American Studies programs you now find in many universities was born out of student activism at SF State where African American activists paved the way for an ethnic studies program. The powers that be will always seek to create divisions among us as a form of control. Don’t buy into the white supremacist tactics.
2,sc58r9,Asian Americans were also considered “coloured” and segregated in many US states.
3,sc58r9,"White Protestants also invented the ""model minority"" myth back in the late 1960s iirc to try and split Asian-Americans and African-Americans (at the same time sadly enough most of the perpetrators of violence against Asian-Americans right now seem to be mentally ill African-Americans, although a professor at the University of Maryland wrote a paper that it only seems that way because a disproportionate number of those incidents have taken place in public \[and so are captured on video and released by the media, creating a false impression\])."
4,sc58r9,"So much has happened between that picture and today. A lot of the Black intelligentsia have a more *pessimistic* view of racial relations between POC. We have started to use BIPOC as a word to highlight unique situations that our respective communities are facing in relation to this country as an example.

I hope we Asian-Americans can find and create a discourse that does not emulate white liberal talking points. Sure, there are reactionary attitudes we have towards the Black community but I don't think we should use 'anti-Black' as a word to describe this abhorrent, reactionary attitudes we have. This is not to say that we have anti-Blackness in our communities. The white liberal just likes to say things and do absolutely nothing. They talk about restorative justice and solidarity without giving a blueprint or concrete plan in relation to material conditions. We have to create a discourse that is distinctly ours, and we have to create a discourse that counters and anticipates the ever evolving appropriation of social justice language by white supremacy.

When we write about anti-Blackness in our community, I wish we could have this conversation as Asian-American activists to Black activists instead of involving all communities for the world to see. I do not trust the liberal media writers in my Asian community to convey this. Don't get me wrong, I support Asian writers, but it is clear to me that we are very unprepared for talks on race. Somehow, we end up throwing the Hmong brothers and sisters under the bus (recently it's Hmong men), and use white liberal talking points which sound like white guilt pieces. In my opinion, Black interlocutors interpret this as Asians sounding like white aspirants.

A lot of this isn't really our fault though. There aren't many critical studies for Asian-Americans in America. We have to be our own organic intellectuals on this matter. I think that this is one way that the Black community can liquidate its justified *pessimism* into a *future* where we can see each other as equals."
5,sc58r9,"Show this to the folks that always say, ""they never helped us so this (Stop Asian Hate or whatever movement it is now) ain't our fight"". Then show the pics where African Americans/black Americans went to support Stop Asian Hate rallies for the Asians that say, ""they never helped us so this (BLM) ain't our fight"".

Complete solidarity will never be achieved but the more people we can educate the closer we can get."
6,sc58r9,"Dude on the right looks like Frank Chu, the ""12 Galaxies"" guy who is a very famous eccentric in the SF Bay Area..."
7,sc58r9,"Anti-blackness is prevalent in all communities, but it is our duty as Asian-Americans, one of many marginalized populations in the United States, to reject white supremacist attitudes and stand in solidarity with all other marginalized groups and fight anti-Blackness in *our* community.  
  
We have more in common with fellow oppressed populations than we do with the oppressors, and division between us is exactly how we will ***all stay*** oppressed. Do not become disillusioned, and do not give into racism. I know some of us may have felt wronged by other minority groups at some point in our lives, but it is because we are all victims of the same divide-and-conquer psychological shackles that I've outlined above. We can overcome this, not with further division, but solidarity.  
  
Stand together with all oppressed peoples, at home and abroad, it's the only way we can make it out together."
8,sc58r9,I feel like there’s been a spam of these distasteful anti black ness within our communities post recently. We as a community are acknowledging it and are wanting more now like the feeling of being protected or safe at home. Come on let’s get with it

14,sc58r9,"I was just saying how I felt like this subreddit was getting increasingly anti black and divisive, so this thread is nice to see :). Our communities should work together and uplift each other instead of pointing fingers at one another. Because tearing other minorities down doesn’t help anyone but white supremacy"
15,sc58r9,"Hahahahahahahaha. Asian Americans are all about ""solidarity"" until they hear that Michelle Go was killed by a black homeless man - suddenly, the whole ""rehabilitative justice"" talk is out the window and its all about ""kill the homeless guy,"" ""he's a waste of life,"" yada yada. And any suggestion that white supremacy is the real enemy and that we should not fight with black people and you're called a ""boba liberal.""

No wonder so many Asians say shit like ""we shouldn't support BLM, they didn't support Stop Asian Hate"" - well no fucking wonder, with this kind of ""support"" Asian America as a whole shows Black America. Who would want to support the lot of us? I don't know exactly if this is a uniquely online thing, but most Asian Americans I know both online and in the meatspace have little-to-no knowledge or passion for radical politics. They're more of a ""boba liberal"" than I, an anarchist, will ever be, but because they put #stopasianhate in their insta bio and say ""Vincent Chin's death is a crime, man!"" they see themselves as revolutionaries. Their deepest thought about capitalism is ""Asians aren't in enough leadership positions"" (wow, the bamboo ceiling is so tragic, we can't become upper managers and exploit our subordinates). Their deepest thought about the prison-industrial complex is ""Bad people should be in jail"" (so who does the state categorize as ""bad""?). Their deepest thought about the government is ""If the right person is in office then democracy is a success"" (so Biden, that geezer who didn't even fulfill his student loan forgiveness promises, was our ""best choice""? What a democracy we live in!).

Fostering radical, solidarity-based politics in Asian America is, in my opinion, a fool's errand. I don't mean to sound like an asshole, but there's a reason the model minority myth is so associated with Asian Americans - so many of us are so easily suckered in by it, by the pull of white-adjacency that assimilation promises. Keep your head down, get good grades, do your work and maybe you'll advance in the system that treats you badly and maybe the system will treat you like a white guy! Maybe we should tear down that system that treats people of color badly - but for the broader Asian American community, that seems like a pipe dream."

I think it's not just COVID but also the general place in the world most Asian countries are in right now (prosperous, and rapidly industrializing).

1,f1sy85,Karen Chee looks like the valedictorian from my high school. Her name is also Karen and she is also Korean...
2,f1sy85,Am I the only one who gets too distracted by eating at the movies?
3,f1sy85,"Meh, I just buy food from outside and smuggle it in under my jacket. You'll find me eating a burrito or a gyro before you'd ever find me eating an orange. Also the real cheap aunties are streaming cam recordings with Chinese subtitles off those sketchy sites at home."
4,f1sy85,Americans are becoming more asian then. My child got like two clementines on Halloween.
5,f1sy85,"Wow, what an original observation.  Asians are so cheap and crafty am I right?  Because no other group of people beside my own sneaks things into the theater.

Totally missing the point that the message of class warfare is resonating globally across cultures."
0,6wuztz,"Casting is cattle wrangling. 10,000 has to be whittled down to 1,000, then to 100, then to five, then to one.  They'll do anything to expeditiously to whittle out people they feel like are non starter.  Looks, height, last names, etc.

If they have Ming Na already on the cast of SHIELD how likely would they be to cast a 2nd Chinese actress?  She could have easily discarded.    But she survived by working the system to her advantage.  Most Asian actors don't have the luxury to do that.  But I'm glad she felt it was important to make this statement and hope she will  make good on her promise."

7,6wuztz,"I still don't know how people are still unaware of all this. Do people not remember the Sony email hacks? there were emails where a Sony exec literally did the very thing aziz ansari joked about. That Hollywood doesn't want more than one minority in certain movies because then it would be an ethnic movie. 

Also due to all this hoopla about Ed dropping out of the role I am going to say this. Some people might roll their eyes but wherever I don't care because this needs to be said. Can people stop ""swooning"" over him just because he dropped out of the role and said something. There were countless MOC that spoke out about hollywood  for years. like for example aziz ansari and a few actors during the whole ""Oscars so white"" situation and I didn't see anyone swooning over them like ""dayum cute af AND a pioneer for social injustice?! Fellas, take note. That's how it's done."" like how chloe just did.  

Because it's a white guy that said something he's suddenly a big sex symbol? I get it that it is a good thing that a white actor does something about this stuff but seriously the amount of crushing I am seeing going on over the internet about  this guy is a little too much considering the amount of MOC that have been doing this for years and they don't even get the same response. I would laugh if we find out he really doesn't even care about all this and it is all a gamble he took to see if he could propel his career to new heights. "

Basically, he's that close family friend your mom never shuts up about. And you can't get rid of him because you're more or less immediate cousins in everything but name. Hate him or love him, no success will compare to his. You could be on a full academic scholarship to UCLA with a paid internship at Ridley Scott's film production company, **aaaaand** a super hot girlfriend, and you'll still get the Korean mom/Italian-American Mom/Jewish-American mom style guilt-tripping for not following ""his"" example. Most *Umchina* fit the profile of 4.0 GPA, perfect if not near-perfect test scores, and stellar looks and charm, and he's not a dick about it. Did I forget doctor, lawyer, or investment banker? He could even bring a non-Asian girl to meet the family and close family friends and they won't even be bothered about the cultural differences because it's ""him.""

0,hlnphu,I feel so jaded. I don't feel like anyone cares if asians are the recipients of hate crime. Upvoted posters in /r/worldnews try to gaslight us and say that it can't be possible because they haven't witnessed it themselves. Sometimes I wonder if I really *should* 'go back to Asia' because then at least I'll have a higher quality of life with people who believe that coronavirus exists.
1,hlnphu,">“I declined and left the store immediately, not wanting any more confrontation.”

That's historically been part of the problem, and has earned us the ""model minority"" label bequeathed upon us by Whites. That's one thing that still irks me about my dad. When I was a child, we were at a park and this shitty racist White fuck of a kid was lobbing all sorts of anti-Asian slurs/name-calling at me, and my dad wouldn't let me respond. *He* also wouldn't respond, all for the sake of being a ""good"" Asian. Our family's been here since the late-1800s and it hasn't gotten us anywhere in regard to respect and being considered truly American. We fucking have the right to break the model minority stereotype and respond in kind, maybe even in a disproportional fashion. All of us do."
2,hlnphu,"The 1.4 million the activists are asking for are honestly peanuts. The fact that Newsom and the state government can't even include that in the state budget really shows they don't give a fuck about us. When people are getting attacked in the streets, Chinese and Asian restaurants have been dropping like flies even months before lockdown, and certain asian populations have been disproportionately affected by the virus, they can't even allocate some spare change?"
3,hlnphu,"If there is one thing that the Asian community can learn from the Black community, it's the constant vocalization of issues harming its community.  Black people do not stay silent, never say 'It's not worth it', and most definitely do not ignore unjest deaths in their community.  Asian-Americans, on the other hand, are far from caring for each other at this level.

This can only be changed if we, as Asians look internally and change how we act instead of waiting for the government to 'bring justice' to our cause.  We can't wait forever, and it is paramount everyday to not let racism slide, correct inaccuracies, defend yourself on the street, and SUPPORT each other.  Silence is complicit and the Asian community has been silent for much too long."
4,hlnphu,I hate how the people who are likely to say this crap is also the type to not wear a mask or social distance. They're freaking prolonging it!
5,hlnphu,These incidents are just going to keep happening until Covid is under control...
6,hlnphu,But we wear masks. It is the responsibility of those who aren't wearing masks that are giving it to other people
7,hlnphu,"This situation is only going to get worst. The U.S. haven't even reached the second wave of the covid19, and the situation has already been dire. When the economy start to really go under and the death toll continually rising, the racism will be even more frequent."

If you watch the video, the brutality of the attack is appalling, a grown ass man over double the size of this grandma goes full on NFL tackle on her.

I live in a place where sometimes I’m the only Asian person around (but I’m a bigger guy or same size as other races so I don’t get targeted) and I think I have a safe time outside so far but I do take more precautions when I’m out with my parents. What are the NYC/Bay Asians doing? Like where are the roof top Koreans of the past? We need those types of Asians to start patrolling again for the safety of others. Police haven’t done much as they are overwhelmed. Even where I live we know police will only come basically if it’s a major crime or death.

1,2q4ofq,"I may or may not be related to this whole brouhaha. 

But I will say this, for whatever people think and whomever they want to blame for whatever stupid theories they have (whether it was Sony's fault, the theaters' fault, NK's fault, a publicity stunt, etc.), please remember that this shit has affected thousands of people/employees. Many of whom don't even have one thing to do with the movie. 

With that said, I have friends who have worked on the movie and they say it's quite funny. They're Asian as well.

Also, Randall Park seems like a smart guy and aware of AA issues so I'd figure he wouldn't take a role that was so absolutely insulting to Asians. Also, it's written by Seth Rogan, so I'm sure there's going to be some colorful jokes. What's a good comedy without a little color anyways?"
2,2q4ofq,"I don't really think it'd be racist. At least, so far their other movies haven't really struck that chord with me. They've seemed to sort of treat everyone like just another person. 

The most racism I've seen regarding the whole situation is, surprise surprise, out of reddit. For some reason, redditors seem wholly unable to criticize North Korea or Kim Jong Un without delving into stereotypes and bigotry against Koreans and Asians in general. 

Tons of hackneyed and overused L/R and small penis jokes in all those threads. I still have to sadly laugh a bit in side at the amount of racism denial that goes on on reddit while it engages in massive and explicit amounts of it."
3,2q4ofq,">Why is this the issue Reddit wants to have protests over?

Because free speech!!1!1! Freedom to jerk it to upskirt photos and laugh at Asians being weird~!!!1!1~~

I dunno, I have really mixed feelings about this. On the one hand, it sets a bad precedent for a studio to be bullied into not releasing a film. On the other hand, I find it very hard to care about this movie in particular. Obviously I haven't seen it, but I get a strong ""ASIANS ARE WEIRD, LOOK HOW WEIRD THEY ARE"" vibe from the trailer. That's nothing new, and nothing I want to see.

I also think that the silly, lighthearted tone is inappropriate for a despotic regime that tortures its citizens. I've read some first-hand accounts of the internment camps from people who grew up inside them, and they are heartbreaking: rampant starvation, sadistic torture, kids taught to turn in their parents, who are then killed. These are real people, not a backdrop for a Seth Rogen-James Franco buddy film."
4,2q4ofq,"I can't judge on whether it is racist or not, but i think it sets a bad precedence to be bullied into dropping a movie release.

This movie is not likely to change any minds about the AA community so i don't believe it has much bearing on the AA community as a whole but it does make Sony look bad, in my opinion. And to be honest, I wonder why Sony is so interested in preventing further leak of its email, to the point where they will take a multimillion dollar loss. Makes me wonder whether they have something to hide.

The Obama emails might just be the least embarrassing emails."
5,2q4ofq,"The whole brouhaha about this movie seems a bit ludicrous to me.  It's a goddamn comedy and a goddamn movie!  Are people so damn thin skinned that they get so easily offended?  If you're offended, then don't see the movie, stay home, play with yourself or do whatever fetish that'll take your mind off this dreaded event.

0,wekx1o,"I think the best (and cheap) thing you could do is volunteer - there are a bunch of Asian hate / Asian support groups that could use volunteers. I've volunteered alongside many non asians in these events, so it's wide-ranging

1,wekx1o,"You've already done so much more than what 90% percent of the American population are willing to do.

Edit grammar"
2,wekx1o,I just want to say THANK YOU for trying to speak up against Asian hate and using your own funds to try to bring about awareness. I’m sorry that you have gone through hostility from fellow Asians. All you can do is continue what you are doing and just do your best. Don’t go broke trying to help though! Just use the power of your voice. Call out people when you see something happening.
3,wekx1o,"Thank you for your willingness to speak out against hate. I think it's important to understand the context of why many Asian Americans tend to be distrustful of black Americans. 

Post WWII, the government needed to find a way to apologize and reintegrate interned Japanese-Americans into society. They also needed to build political support from other Asian countries and communities through the Korean and Vietnam Wars. This coincided with a growing Civil Rights movement which many people in power wanted to mitigate. So, Asians were built up as the ""model minority"", while blacks were further villainized through aggressive propaganda. It was an effective example of divide and conquer. Asians and blacks were deliberately and methodically pitted against each other. 

Unfortunately, many people believed the propaganda and still teach these ideas to their children today. It is especially sad that these beliefs have led to real world violence. But there were also some incredible leaders who understood that we must work together for the common good. People from many races and backgrounds benefited from the Civil Rights Act when it was passed in 1964. Many of us continue to build on their legacy today. 

My suggestion to you would be to volunteer with multicultural organizations in your neighborhood. Talk to people in the Asian-American community and find out the specific ways they need help. When you prove yourself to be trustworthy with a few people, your reputation eventually follows you. Your ability to reach more people grows. Start small. Make genuine connections. Share your own culture with others as well. An open door and an open heart work both ways."
4,wekx1o,"If you’re going broke doing this, it’s too much. Please take care of yourself too.

Anecdotally, my mom, a first generation immigrant, has many positive things to say about black people that she’s worked with, or even in circumstances when she was robbed, it was a another black person that came and helped her and made she she was okay. It was the same for me a couple of times when I was yelled at or threatened on the subway; black people asking whether I was okay, standing between me and the attacker, etc. Heck, someone even gave me literally the shirt off his back when I was sick and throwing up (not fun). Having those good experiences to draw from really helps push away all the bad stories one hears about. But obviously balance that with your own safety.

I don’t want black folks like you to feel like they have to carry this burden, because as a minority, we know that the worst of us often sets an expectation for how others view us. I personally think being a good person and helping us, and others, when you can, is enough."
5,wekx1o,"I probably have no business speaking on this subject (I'm African American), but here I go. I too, suffer with this burden of feeling as if i can't communicate my viewpoints on the increase violence against Asians. Some of the responses I've received when broaching the topic to other black people are either dismissive or, on a rare occasion, met with whataboutism. I have a friend who's Phillipino and a coworker as well. I've brought up the topic to them as well. Both responded as if it wasn't really an issue to them because **personally** they haven't noticed a uptick in violence or racism directed towards them. That much I just chalk up to anecdotal experiences.

What I will say is just do the best you can with bringing awareness to these issues. If you see something, say something. I've got no advice when it comes to hostility directed against you other then just put on a happy smile and bare it."
6,wekx1o,"Just wanted to agree with what others are saying - you're already doing so much and I appreciate that you say you care. It's comforting knowing that allyship between communities has BEEN there and continues to be possible, despite what media has to say otherwise. I do hope you will meet other Asians who see you and appreciate you for what you're doing. And I hope they can support you as well in whatever struggle you may face yourself."
7,wekx1o,"I just wanted to say that your kindness and empathy is already meaningful as is.

My father, a first generation immigrant who is now retired, unfortunately had many negative experiences with black men throughout his entire life, mainly either he or his wife becoming a victim for crime.  However, the positive interactions, no matter how few, really live on and become the bulwark against hate.  He had some very positive experiences of black people sprinkled in that he thinks of *decades* later when the topic of black on asian violence comes up.  They are small things like the really smart Nigerian immigrants he went to school with, the super nice plumber, the very polite/shy black friend I brought home when I was in high school (I rarely brought over friends since my school was super far).  It helps him understand how complex the issue is.

And of course as other commentators pointed out, you and the vast VAST majority black/african american people are in no way responsible for the actions of the few."
8,wekx1o,"Hi OP, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for all of your support against Asian hate. You are sincerely a kind soul. I’m so sorry for the recent trouble in your efforts regarding the PD situation.

To advise you the best I can, I suggest starting with a smaller scope to make the biggest impact. You’ve been taking the right steps to speak with friends and family. Are you in any clubs, organizations, teams, or groups? Gather the support from these close audiences, and it will help amplify your voice as you spread awareness. Best of luck!! We support you so much!"
9,wekx1o,"Just talk about it when the opportunity arises. No one needs to go on a crusade about this. Do good where you can when you can and don't feel burdened by or responsible for other black peoples actions and misdeeds.

On either end of the spectrum, I don't think it's ever good to hold scores and grievances over another based on demographic. We should be judging people based on their own actions and merits. Not the actions and merits of others who simply belong in the same demographic. You can show support by condemning the action when it occurs and supporting those who need the support."
10,wekx1o,I think the only reasonable thing to do is to call out racism when you see it. Keep up the good work!
11,wekx1o,Thank you! The world needs more people like you.
12,wekx1o,"I try not to post too often here as an African American, but I’d love some advice on how to put some spotlight on the Asian community when it comes to professional/business environments. I am often the only person of color in my boardrooms, and though I’m not a high-level manager, I work at a well-known brand that has the $ to make some moves, and I’m the go-to brown person, it seems. Frequently conversations come up about “how do we reach minorities?” And in the back of my head I’m yelling “Fucking hire some more” because I am not equipped to speak on behalf of even all black folks, much less Asians and Hispanics.

But in the meantime I’d like to try. Do I just come out and say “Y’all need to hire some Asians at the bare minimum if you want them to become customers.”? I find myself defaulting to “I don’t think most companies are even on the map with Asians…nobody even promotes the month dedicated to their history…they have to be wondering why they’re invisible. Start SOMEWHERE already.” But I know I’m not doing the best job here."
13,wekx1o,"Speak up when you see an Asian person getting hatecrimed, join support groups, get educated on Asian issues, listen to Asian voices. Unfortunately since you're in the US I doubt the police will do anything. So it's best to ask Asian people you know irl what to do to help."
14,wekx1o,"At 18 years old, you're doing SO MUCH MORE than other older people (who should know better) are! Thank you so much for trying and I hope the negative experiences don't turn you away from helping other people.

We are all poc and there are so much more in terms of similarities between our communities than differences. I think you and other kind people trying to bridge the gaps are helping tremendously. There are orgs like @blackandasiansoulsunite on Instagram trying to bring our communities together too, though more people need to get on that train instead of promoting divisionist white supremacist beliefs like the model minority stereotype."
15,wekx1o,"same thing asian ams have been doing, just talk to your family and friends"
16,wekx1o,"I wanna say thanks for sharing this + I’m sorry you don’t feel welcome at our restaurants. There’s no excuse for hostile behaviour like that from the establishments, and honestly there’s no need to *try* to look non-violent, I would rather you be *you* man. You deserve to eat out without thinking of how you are looked at, and both Asian and Black communities need to work on dismantling stereotypes and treating people on an individual basis.

Stereotypes is where it’s all at: This sub has dissected anti-AAPI hate from a variety of angles, and while there still is no easy answer to why it has happened so much recently, a common thread seems to be that the attacks are predicated by an attacker’s derogatory preconceived notions about Asian people - for example, the Atlanta shooter targeted a spa specifically due to the sexual connotations attributed to Asian-owned spa parlours (despite this place being just a normal spa). Or the shooting of Hua King, where he was killed because he was “driving too slow” - another negative stereotype attributed to Asian Americans.

And so, I think the key thing to stop AAPI hate is to fight Asian stereotypes, especially negative ones, at any chance you can get. By fighting the solidification of stereotypes, you help society to see that Asian people aren’t so different from the rest of America. No merch or protesting is needed, just keep an open mind and be educated and ready to call people or brands out when you see them run afoul. I admire your drive to help out a community that isn’t yours by default - but hopefully in the end, both our communities will be helping each other out in this same fashion.

We will get there one day, I know it."
17,wekx1o,"Your work is appreciated, probably more than you know. It’s unlikely that you’ll be single-handedly able to make everyone a lot more aware about this than they already are, but one thing you can do is volunteer work with organizations assisting elderly Asian people. It’ll be a big help, like helping them go out and buy groceries or even just providing some company, especially during this period when some are afraid to go out."
18,wekx1o,"Thank you. But there is not much that an individual can do. The media has lost the interests. The government, if anything, is more focused on the geopolitical struggle with China than anti-Asia hate waves."
19,wekx1o,"Hey I just want to thank everyone for the advice. From what I've heard, i'll volunteer at any support groups I can, I'll continue to speak up when the need arises. I just want people to continue to live peacefully and I'm willing to fight for that"
20,wekx1o,"Wtf bro they detained you for 20 hours for ""trespassing"" holy shit that's fucken crazy"
21,wekx1o,"I also want to throw out this point of view for consideration:

Given the United State's foreign policy towards Asia (China, for example), both historically and currently, we are only going to see increasing amounts of hate rhetoric towards Asians being endorsed- if not directly by American media, then tacitly through silence. This hate rhetoric allows the American people as a whole to dehumanize Asians, making it easier to commit violence against them as an enemy, should geopolitical tensions ever explode into outright war.

The US has had interests in the Pacific since at least the mid-to-late 1800s (the forcible opening of Korea, the occupation of the Philippines, the boxer rebellion, all pre-1900s), so anti-Asian sentiments prevalent in American culture (anti-immigration laws passed specifically to bar Asians-- the Page Act, Chinese Exclusion Act) has been a thing for at least that long. So, Americans who grow up in American culture will naturally develop a unconscious racism towards Asians _because it is an endemic part of American culture_. 

The last thing the US Govt wants is for there to be conscientious objectors to war who might sway public opinion, as was seen in the 60s with the Vietnam war. For example, Muhammad Ali in 1966 saying, quite correctly, what did the Vietnamese ever do to him, his enemy was right at home. Even in the 50s, during the Korean war, pamphlets like [this](https://imgur.com/a/nMpLZ) or [this](https://i.redd.it/r6anknbek4881.png) were being dropped that rightly pointed out that soldiers were fighting for the Big Businesses (capitalism) of a country that wouldn't even give them basic human rights, so why come here to kill other colored people.

In 1955, the first ever Afro-Asian conference was held between countries in Africa and Asia that had been liberated from colonial forces. The purpose of this conference was to promote economic exchange and fight against forces of colonization that had ravaged their nation and people. In 1957, the Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Conference was held. In 1958, the first Asian-African Conference on Women. 

The countries that attended represented nearly half of the entire world's population. That's 50% of the entire globe. Imagine the absolute power of such a union of countries and how absolutely devastating this potential strength would be to western hegemony. 

Richard Wright documents in his book ""The Color Curtain"" that Americans and Europeans feared that the Bandung conference would promote a global ""antiwhite"" backlash. We can posit from this, then, that an immediate goal of the western world would be to drive a wedge between any budding alliance between nations or between races.

Through the whitewashing of history, we forget how much of a driving force communism was for oppressed people to pursue their liberation (whether they were oppressed based on race, class, or sex), and how much the forces of reaction tried to stifle these movements through acts of war or through domestic witch-hunts. Mao Zedong, yes evil 10-gorillion-sparrow-deaths Mao, and the PRC in general, served as inspiration to many black radicals such as Harry Haywood (who developed the theory of Black Americans as an oppressed nation inside the US) and W. E. B. Dubois. The Black Panther Party sent members to visit the DPRK, acting as a representative of the oppressed black colony inside the USA.

Anyway, all this is to say that the escalation of racial divide between races living in the US is simply helping the machine. I'm not forgiving individual actions and I'm not saying that this isn't an issue that needs to be discussed. I'm saying this is an intentionally created racial conflict to fuck up solidarity between oppressed groups of people. And boy, they're doing a fucking fantastic job fueling this conflict.

23,wekx1o,"a lot of people have covered good ground here so i just have a quick, very easy tip for you:

for asians, especially those that are clearly more recent immigrants or those who immigrated as adults, learn a couple phrases in their language. hello, thank you, you're welcome, and how are you is really all you need to bridge the gap.

i still get so happy when someone says the simplest things to me in Korean. imo it's the easiest way to immediately show the other person that you're someone who cares.

Shedding light on one of the ways Asian Americans have suffered from the pandemic, some time ago the Pew Research Center estimated the unemployment rate for Asian American workers may have been 20.3% in May, on par with those for Black and Hispanic Americans.


Dancer and former Radio City Rockette [Amanda Kloots](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/82/f0/4e/82f04eb4c60766fc6f35c0efb8386301.jpg) documented her husband Nick Cordero's struggle COVID-19-related complications on social media, spreading awareness of the dangers. In a message paying tribute to Nick after his death, Kloots also praised David Ng: 

“To Nicks extraordinary doctor, Dr. David Ng, you were my positive doctor! There are not many doctors like you. Kind, smart, compassionate, assertive and always eager to listen to my crazy ideas or call yet another doctor for me for a second opinion. You’re a diamond in the rough.”

The ignorant forget or ignore that Asians were never the enemy of the pandemic, they were victims like non-Asians were - and heroes too. Asians have been oppressed but *also* contributors to the country for centuries. They've been contributing while performing labor to build this country, and they're contributing right now treating and helping victims of the pandemic."

That's just the way it is.  We think that they will approve of us if we save their lives?  They will rue you for being the one that takes care of them.  Get real.

Stop being shocked that they spit, scream, and scatch you.  Any real nurse will tell you how it is.  They hate that fact that some Asian POS is the one taking care of them.  Imagine going to the hospital and the person taking care of you is the same ""Ch-nk"" you shit on every day.

>In June 1986, then-15-year-old Wahlberg and three friends chased after three black children while yelling ""Kill the nigger, kill the nigger"" and throwing rocks at them.[14] The next day, Wahlberg and others followed a group of mostly black fourth graders (including one of the victims from the previous day) taking a field trip on a beach, yelled racial epithets at them, threw rocks at them, and ""summoned other white males who joined"" in the harassment.[14][15] In August 1986, civil action was filed against Wahlberg for violating the civil rights of his victims, and the case was settled the next month.[16][17][18]

*edit.  Are You guys are downvoting me because you’re not happy that I’m calling people out for not taking the proper measures in a pandemic situation?  Talk about ignorance..."
19,fk4pwn,This looks like a stunt.
0,ewotjx,"It's significant for me to see a young, mixed-ethnicity Asian American in such a high-profiled film embrace her identity this way. I could imagine how it'd feel for young Asian kids to see a role model like this, playing a young superhero and proudly showcasing her Korean side on the red carpet. Hopefully we'll see even more young Asian actors in the future. I have high hopes for the Fresh Off The Boat boys!"
1,ewotjx,I'm not sure if it's also intended or if it's just me but there are elements of this dress that remind me of a Barong Tagalog/Baro't saya.
2,ewotjx,Glad to see the movie's getting rave reviews so far.  I'm really curious to see how they adapted Cassandra's backstory for the movie.

1,chpycc,"I believe he also pretty much says that the Chinese aren't funny too during that episode too, because he says that some cultures just aren't as good for humor."
2,chpycc,"I was never crazy about Jerry Seinfeld honestly.

Edit: Spelling"
3,chpycc,"I feel like the only way this complaint can get any traction is if you get Angry Asian Man or Jeff Yang to tweet about this. And sadly, I can see the response from non-Asians being ""it's just a joke, get a sense of humor"" and using that to reinforce the stereotype that Asians don't have a sense of humor..."
4,chpycc,"Seinfeld is so out of touch with reality. Between comments/“jokes” like that and treating service staff like trash, it’s clear that his wealth and fame has completely scrambled his brain."
5,chpycc,"He's always championed the ""comedians can say what they want because it's a joke"" line of thought. 

That makes me uncomfortable. I think it allows people to dehumanize(not a a good word but can't think of a better one) groups that are already at a social disadvantage."
6,chpycc,[deleted]
7,chpycc,"I love comedy and I watch a lot of standup clips, TV shows, etc. I've seen some Seinfeld and the show was funny. FBE did a reaction video to Seinfeld and obviously some things didn't age well but I think people take jokes too seriously.

Something always rubbed me the wrong way about Jerry Seinfeld himself though. I could never put my finger on it but I guess it manifests itself in ways like this. It's like you can almost tell he's got some ignorant thoughts about race, wealth, celebrity, etc. that are just beneath the surface and rarely come up."
8,chpycc,He's trash.
9,chpycc,Seinfeld fucking sucks. Loved the show but as a person he's about as out of touch as one could be. A real fucking windbag.
10,chpycc,"He tried to neg John Mulaney into saying bad things about his wife like she thinks she knows everything, and John tried to defend his wife from the old naggy and know it all wife stereotype. the context was they were looking for a carpet for Mulaney’s apartment for comedians in cars getting coffee and his wife is an interior designer."
11,chpycc,Older comedians get really weird and go all right wing-y. I mean Gervais is basically a terf now. Seinfeld tried to gaslight John Mulaney into believing his wife didn’t know much about Interior design
12,chpycc,fuck seinfeld in general shit is overrated

14,chpycc,"I loved his TV show, and it's become part of our culture, but Seinfeld's the most overrated comic of his time. I've watched maybe 2 of his stand up specials, and if I didn't know who he was, I would've turned the channel."
15,chpycc,"Completely agree.

Imagine the outrage if Ricky said all blacks looked the same.

I actually think some Asian-Americans would be more outraged if Jerry Seinfeld said all blacks looked the same than if Jerry Seinfeld said all Chinese looked the same. Which is a sad state of affairs."
16,chpycc,"Who's surprised? Two of the most overrated, unfunny white men ever. I'm so glad I never contributed to their egregiously excessive wealth. Seinfeld is so unfunny it's worse than anything Adam Sandler has ever made. Everyone on that show is so smug."
17,chpycc,"Yeah i use to be a fan but no more. He did it because he assumes we won't speak up. He would never do this to Hispanics or African Americans because of the Swift backlash

He did it because he thinks we are easy targets. Let's prove him wrong"
18,chpycc,"Imagine someone like Ronnie Chieng or Awkwafina saying something like ""I know this isn't PC, but all white people look like KKK members."""

1 - Seinfeld, when he was 38, dated a 17 year old.

2 - All white people look the same.

Have a good day, everyone :)"
20,chpycc,Ricky Gervais has gone on an alt-right tangent for his comedy so it's not surprising Seinfeld would also play to that unfortunately.
21,chpycc,I stopped watching Seinfeld years ago.  Glad I did.
22,chpycc,"Not cool. What's with the racists from his show? Him and Michael Richards. Just goes to show with the idea that making jokes about other groups, you might face backlash but insults against Asians are OK.

I'd say he's going to face some backlash but is he even relevant anymore? The last I've seen Seinfeld in was the credit card/gas station commercial."
23,chpycc,"That sucks. I haven’t seen that episode. Chris Rock also made disparaging remarks about Asian men in his movie Top Five that shocked me. I really liked him as a comedian, but not so much after that.

Maybe it’s that generation of comics."
24,chpycc,"This shouldn't be a surprise to anyone really

Seinfeld is known to be a huge jerk. If you want to take the word on reddit as one of the many examples of this. Whenever there is a topic about which celebs have bad attitudes in real life. Seinfeld tops the list. there's usually plenty of stories from users about how he treated them bad."
25,chpycc,"Dumb thing to say, but JS was one of the biggest reasons behind getting Margaret Cho exposure when she first started out (according to MC herself), so I don't think he's a racist. Again, dumb thing to say, but actions speak louder than words"
26,chpycc,So...are we gonna publicly hold him accountable with being racist against Asians? Or is another non-Asian celebrity gonna get away with ridiculing Asians without consequences?
27,chpycc,We are one of the last races still able to be made fun of.  Even by our own people.
28,chpycc,"Not that Seinfeld has ever been edgy (he is bland and plays it quite safe for mainstream audiences), but why the fuck are comedians always falling all over themselves to be edgy. Trying like hell to offend someone, and the one time they get a rise out of someone, get heckled or booed, they whine about people not being able to take a joke incessantly? Some comedians start whining about how sensitive people are before they say even tell you the joke. It's always because there isn't a joke. A joke and punchline don't matetialize out of thin air when you say some stupid racist bullshit. If they would stop focusing on this tryhard antiPC crap, they could write some actual jokes"
29,chpycc,[removed]
30,chpycc,I was never a fan of that show or any of Netflix’s ”late-night” shows.
31,chpycc,"There's lots of levels to any joke and one of them for this joke is making fun of American's racist perception of Chinese people as all being the same and not being funny

That's why its a funny thing to say, it was even made the focal point of the episode! If they actually weren't happy with the joke he would have edited it out. In fact he probably had to argue with lots of people to keep it in the episode."

35,chpycc,Is Anthony Jeselnik a serial killer because he jokes about skinning someone and turning them into a lamp? Of course not. There is a style of comedy where you portray yourself as something terrible to break a taboo. It’s a burn on people with the perspective and not an admission of your opinion. Aka Seinfeld makes hackney comment to ridicule the perspective.
36,chpycc,"Misleading title dude. He never said all Asians look the same, that's your interpretation. Outrage culture lives on."
37,chpycc,Jesus is this sub r/politics or something? Lighten up it’s a comedy show.

0,wc3cj8,"I grew up as a Chinese Christian. My parents weren’t Christian but sent me to both a church (it offered transportation to and from Sunday school) and a Christian private school (it was better the public schools in my area). I learned from church that it was wrong to do ancestral rites that have been practiced in Chinese culture for literally thousands of years. For Qing Ming (tomb sweeping day), I stopped bowing to my ancestors’ tombs and stopped eating the food that was offered to my ancestors. My parents were really angry at me. So that’s one way Christianity cut me off from my Chinese culture. (I’ve since left the church and resumed Chinese ancestral rites.)"
1,wc3cj8,"NGL, as a Thai Buddhist, I am glad Christianity didn't find many converts in our culture. So much of our culture and so many of our customs are tied to Buddhism, and those things would be supplanted through colonization and conversion. That being said, Thai Muslims are still very much part of Thai culture,  but through geography and migration,  they share much culture and history with the Malays. 

I am glad that, though not perfect, Thai people enjoy religious freedom."
2,wc3cj8,"I'll add this quote from Desmond Tutu, a South African Anglican bishop. “When the missionaries came to Africa, they had the Bible and we had the land. They said: 'Let us pray. ' We closed our eyes. When we opened them, we had the Bible and they had the land.”"
3,wc3cj8,"A lot of the feedback in this thread is coming from the East Asian POV, but I think a good example of this dynamic is the Philippines. Pre-Spanish Philippines truly marked the archipelago as a major hub of trading and a meeting point for various cultures to come together with local peoples - Chinese, Japanese, Malay, etc.. If I were to guess, the people were like what we see in Indonesia or Malaysia 

However, post-colonialization, Spanish Catholicism has pretty much stripped those people of the original ""character"" to the point that the Philippines is an interesting derivative of Hispanic and Southeast Asian, that it doesn't really fit as ""Asian-Asian"".... I mean look at the arguments about Filipinos being Pacific Island vs Asian.

As a Fil-Am (Filipino American), I've always felt lost with my asianness, and it's hard to look back to the Philippines for that Asian culture - because it doesn't seem Asian at all!!! Instead, there's Filipino culture, which is an interesting mish-mash of Spanish, Chinese, and Malay"
4,wc3cj8,"It's not just an ""interesting sentiment"", what the missionaries did to the Lakota. It was genocide. Except their Hitler didnt get vilified. They didnt have to pay reparations and to this day the history is omited in school."
5,wc3cj8,"Christianity has played an incredibly toxic role in my upbringing. I truly see it as the religion of the colonizers. With that said, I recognize the community it can provide especially for newly-arrived immigrants in America. Still, I wish my great great grandfather never met that white missionary back in the old country over a century ago."
6,wc3cj8,"In Korea, Christianity was associated with the independence movement and, in a way, was seen as a form of ""resistance"" against the Shintoism of Japanese occupiers. There were also some churches/ministers involved in helping Korean refugees and war victims in the 50s. 

South Korea is one of the most evangelical Christian nations in East Asia but the establishment of the religion there is a bit different."
7,wc3cj8,"Y'know, I have been told that Christians in Korea sporadicallly vandalize old Buddhist architecture and monuments for 'idolatry' against Christianity. 

I'm pretty sure when same-sex marriage rose up to become legal in Taiwan, Christian groups made themselves loudly known in news footage of the failed counterprotest movement. 

And I have been told by some Singaporean émigrés that the Christianity in their country lends itself to the cause of the government's repression, including of LGBT people."
8,wc3cj8,"Christianity, particularly Catholicism, totally fucked the Philippines."
9,wc3cj8,"As a Filipino, the Catholic Church is insanely toxic and IMO, does more harm than good to our cultures and peoples. 

For example, the sex education and access to contraception is deeply lacking, divorce isn’t legal, etc. which all lead to a poorer quality of life for women and girls. 

I also noticed my parents are a lot more progressive than quite a lot of others bc they aren’t Catholic - unlike my friends parents (most of whom are deeply Catholic) they aren’t homophobic, anti-abortion, etc bc they aren’t driven by a religion where such thinking is encouraged. 

There’s a Pinay rapper I really love (Rocky Rivera) and in one of her songs she says “I’ll never pray to a faith whose roots are pillaging and rape” (or something like that) and I think about it all the time. Catholicism entered the Philippines through extremely violent means and continues to have deeply negative impacts on our various communities all over the world."
10,wc3cj8,"Oddly enough Christianity is rapidly growing in Asia far more than the west, where it’s declining.  Africa is a huge hotspot too.

Looking at its modern demographics, if heaven is true, then a lot of white Christians are in for a surprise when they arrive at the pearly gates, it’s a quite the “colorful” party.

I suppose it makes sense, we're in a totally different situation from the Lakota when you remember.... it's an Asian religion when you think about it.  Hell, the first official Christian kingdoms were in Africa before anyone in Spain or Britain even heard of Christ."
11,wc3cj8,"If you don't believe in this certain religion, you will go to hell no matter what a good person you are. Perhaps the ""success""(aka wide influence) of the Christian religion comes from its aggressiveness."
12,wc3cj8,"I will always appreciate the Taiwanese Presbyterian Church for creating safe spaces for pro-democracy, anti-authoritarian spaces for activists to organize in the later half of the 1900s.  They played a crucial role in democratizing Taiwan and ending martial law and White Terror.

So I can't and won't dispute that, but I do think that modern white American Christianity dumping a ton of influence into Taiwanese church networks *is* harming LGBTQ people in Taiwan."
13,wc3cj8,"Was raised Roman Catholic before leaving the church. I’ve seen Christianity make a positive difference in some people’s lives, and I think everyone should find the spiritual beliefs (or lack thereof) which make them feel safest, happiest and most welcomed. But I’ve seen Christianity grievously hurt people more often - people who stayed in the church, left the church and joined the church. 

The article OP highlights is right - non-Western and especially Indigenous American communities around the world, including in Asia, have experienced Christianity as a primary vector of colonialism for 500 years (to say nothing of the Catholic Church’s atrocities during the Crusades in both the Middle East and Central/Eastern Europe further back). For many places around the world, Christianity’s net contribution has been one of cultural destruction, identity-based oppression and personal suffering.

The older I get, and the more I learn about Christian history (how typically ex-Catholic of me), the more convinced I become that the problem is Christianity’s dual claims to universality and singular salvation. It’s difficult to do because this was such an early inflection point, but I wonder how much harm might’ve been avoided if early Christians hadn’t adopted Paul’s letters as canonical theology."
14,wc3cj8,"I burned all bridges with my parents' Asian church when the youth pastor at the time declared that LGBTQ+ were ""inferior people"". While I recognize that spiritual religion has its importance and value, organized religion (regardless of which community it is entrenched in) is about power and control - not faith, humanity, or the tenets that it claims to espouse."
15,wc3cj8,[deleted]
16,wc3cj8,"Yes. Being raised one, I really do think that a lot of them do not want a lot of spirituality and faith to exist because its not about their god. For example, one of the first things that the Americans started to do once they reached my people was to proselytize and make inferior the traditional faith. 

So now you have generations and people like my dad who continue the language and customs, but in faith it is the colonizer faith. I agree with the representative, part of what makes me proud of my culture is that, even with all of that colonization, you have people that still keep alive the generations old beliefs. We had/have our own thing going with spirituality and that does not sit well with a good number of christians. My dad and aunt will prove that."
17,wc3cj8,"Honestly I'm a Buddhist Burmese and my country has like over 3500 ancient pagodas and I'm glad Christianity didn't grow big, which would've most likely destroyed a lot of ancient pagodas and erasing hundreds of years of Buddhist history."
18,wc3cj8,"Yes, and I'm a Christian -

They say that Catholicism is Roman Culture influencing Christianity, and I would say that whatever label that's going to be put on our ""modern"" influenced spin is going to be Christianity as influenced by marketing/capitalism.

It's like watching a virus get engineered; there was perhaps a spreadable gospel that was positive to the world, but someone cut that DNA to keep the transmission, but failed to splice in what was supposed to be good. It's like a virus with the main function of spreading for the sake of spreading (or will do whatever it takes to spread, whether the outcome is net good or bad for the population).

This isn't to say that there aren't Churches that teach how to love and also how to love oneself, but from my first hand experience, a majority of these missionaries are borderline colonial in mindset. Or (and I don't know what's worse) promote a sort of ""volunteer tourism"" where your friends pose with a dozen poor children so you can post the picture on facebook and in the church newsletter.

I nearly joined an Asian Church plant a few years back, but had not pulled the trigger due to financial reasons, but was so glad I didn't. Letters and hearing about the family that wanted to start it basically ignored the culture and basically recreated an American church in the country, which is to say it alienated locals and attracted ex-pats and those already familiar with that style of worship."
19,wc3cj8,"Given the historical violence and taking of local resources under colonization by Christian missionaries, I question whether Christianity was ever adopted as an actual belief system at scale. If someone threatens me with death, starvation, or social ostracization if I *don't* claim to agree with them, there is significant incentive to lie. Coercion is not the same as choosing your faith. If enough people over time claim the label as a means of survival rather than choosing it as a meaningful belief system, hypocrisy becomes the defining characteristic of the religion. It further compounds as it gets passed on through generations. Modern Christianity absolutely reflects this history."
20,wc3cj8,I think Christianity in Korean communities is toxic as hell.
21,wc3cj8,I feel this way about all religion. It’s all bullshit
22,wc3cj8,"As a Kazak, I feel exactly the same way as the author."
23,wc3cj8,"It's true that a lot of non-white cultures converted on their own, but I don't see how anybody could argue that the prevalence of Christianity as it is today isn't rooted in bigotry, white supremacy, and colonialism/imperialism. And even if it were not, it's still misogynistic and anti-LGBT.

I am adopted I actually think my parents did a good job raising me not to be ashamed of being Asian (this is not true for a lot of other adoptees so I love them for this and am grateful). But raising me Christian was a big, big mistake. First, it was a mistake regardless of how or where I was raised or who raised me because I sensed how sexist it was very early on. I'm a woman first. But it was also a mistake because my church was not shy about saying anyone who wasn't Christian would be going to Hell, and deserve it. I knew most people in Asia were not Christian, so to think that I was surrounded by people who felt that not only my motherland but almost everyone who vaguely looked like me should burn in eternity, or weren't the chosen people, messed me up. Especially because I knew from school that a lot of Christianity was forced or coerced conversions. I was and am proud of Asia for keeping its pre-Christian religions.

I have thought about trying to reconnect to Buddhism, but maybe the CPC got to me early on. I can't not be an atheist, it's feels like it's part of my DNA or something."
24,wc3cj8,"Theres a difference between Christianity itself, and people who used Christianity for colonialism or other nefarious gains. If the British were Buddhist, they would have used that to take over the world instead.

In Sri Lanka, Buddhist extremist have perverted the Buddhist religion in order to oppress Muslims. It doesn’t make buddhism wrong.
Same with Islam and Muslims. Yeah there is the taliban. But for the most part they’re just tax paying regular citizens. Havent we all learned something from 9/11v"
25,wc3cj8,"Interestingly I will note for some Asian contexts, like in Singapore, and sometimes Japan or South Korea, Christianisation is strongly attached to class. 

Many upper class people from those places identify with western values and want to strip themselves of their Asian upbringings by assimilating into the west via Christianity. Not saying that this is bad per se (if they’re adult they can do what they want), but an interesting sociological observation. 

And this manifests as a majority of working class Asians often sticking to more traditional faiths with longer histories in the region (Shinto, Buddhism, Taoism, Korean Shamanism)."
26,wc3cj8,Organized religion is about control
27,wc3cj8,My mom is is from the Philippines and she rejected Christianity early in her life. My dad was from the Caribbean/Latin America and did the same. I was brought up in a strictly secular home and always kind of taught that Christianity was a tool of colonialism and to avoid it.
28,wc3cj8,"i feel this way about every single possible religion and religious movement (new age included) past present future

no gods no masters"
29,wc3cj8,"No, not to the level that Native Americans (and probably African slaves) experienced it. These children were basically kidnapped and forced to adopt Christianity and to remove their cultural heritage. On top of that, they were physically and mentally abused and raped. It is an abomination. It's disgusting.

I went to an evangelical-run elementary school in HK (grade 1 through 6). My parents just didn't know better (they were not religious). We had ""service"" every morning 45min to an hour held by the teachers (who were religious zealots). Even at a young age, I was appalled by their intolerance and hatred. They superficially preached love and then degraded other religions and people who weren't in their circles. Some got so worked up as to tell us that those folks (non Christians) are going to die and burn in hell and all sorts of different nasty things.

I thought to myself, ""Why are these adults who preach love and peace from the bible have so much hatred that they cannot even contain within themselves?"" Even though Christians keep thrusting their beliefs down my throat (they literally knock on my doors regularly), I am a total atheist."
30,wc3cj8,"I was raised very Christian. I disengaged from the religion early on not only due to my own personal beliefs, but because European colonizers used it to oppress people round the world. I’m happy for people that they find the spirituality in their faith, but it ain’t me."
31,wc3cj8,"The reasons why some non-Western communities adopt Christianity (or any other organized religion for that matter) are complicated - in some cases it was merely foisted upon them by their colonizers and in some cases it was willingly adopted and had genuine appeal to their local mindset.  Another issue is that while Christianity is also at its core no more Western than say Islam or Judaism, a lot of proselytizing was and continues to be conducted by extremely Eurocentric voices and that has been reflected in things like the Canadian Residential Schools and certain Western religious leaders condemning certain secularized non-Western cultural practices because of their pagan roots all while they celebrate Western practices with pagan roots like Christmas.  Many of their ideas and practices were really just Western imperialism disguised as religion.  It should also be noted that most Indigenous people in Canada and the US are Christian and while their faith and community means a lot to many of them, they acknowledge the racist harm that Christian authorities have inflicted upon them and ask for accountability (which explains why the Pope's apology during his most recent Canada visit meant a lot to First Nations Catholics)."
32,wc3cj8,"My parents are very involved in the Filipino community at their Catholic Church and always celebrate the founding of Catholicism in the Philippines each year. 

Each year I help them set up the hall and fight the urge to tell them to remember all the deaths that led to this day."
33,wc3cj8,"I wouldn’t say it’s exclusive to Christianity,  but Islam and other “indigenous cultures” and religions as well. It’s been a series of violent conquest through rape, murder and forced conversion.

There are many good and bad people and groups of different religious backgrounds, but most religions have a violent history, unfortunately."
34,wc3cj8,Yes
35,wc3cj8,"Gonna be honest, the day my gramps turned devout christain was the day it looked like he joined a cult...

he used to believe that all things good were wrought from one's own hard work, and then he was begging to someone else that nobody seen for even small things good. Didn't sit right with me."
36,wc3cj8,"I care about whether an idea is true or not.

Christianity is not true, so I'll reject it regardless of whether it was spread through violence or through sunshine and rainbows.  If it were true or even halfway plausible, it'd be a different matter."
37,wc3cj8,"""Interesting sentiment"" - it's fact. Speaking as an AsAm who grew up in a Christian household, Christianity brought so much repression, toxicity, marginalization, etc."
38,wc3cj8,"I have nothing against Christianity. Some of the biggest problems with Christianity, and with religion in general, is that people are vulnerable to twisted ideals from certain authoritative figures like pastors or other religious community leaders. Simply put, people who don't study the bible intensively oftentimes find themselves being corrupted by the bigoted logic that is echoed by hateful and backward communities. 

The distaste for the LGBTQ community is a good example of ""invalid"" Christianity. Many people misinterpret certain teachings of the bible and only validate content that they deem are sufficient to their own beliefs.

That being said, I see churches as community centers. In my country, The United States of America, churches host large quantities of charitable events. I am not a Christian myself, but I can't ignore the statistics that Christians make the most donations to charities. The concept of community service and philanthropy is a core component in the Christian faith, so someone who was raised with a good and healthy Christian mindset will typically turn out well enough. 

I don't have historical knowledge on how Christianity became so dominant in certain parts of Asia, particularly South Korea, but I assume it is because the conservative nature of the religion compliments the culture of some of these East Asian countries. I may be extremely wrong, so I am open to corrections."
39,wc3cj8,"some asian americans will talk about how damaging it is to not see asian faces on TV or in movies, but then go home and pray to a portrait of white jesus hanging on their wall not realizing the mental colonization that is happening to them and their families and communities"
40,wc3cj8,"Most of the Catholics have been fine for Koreans in Korea, they are not so proseltyzy any more and it seems to me at least to be ""Rich/established people"" religion. Evangelicals/Protestants on the other hand in general are fucking nightmares though and highly likely to be part of a cult. These cultists almost always target the poor, because the poor have an easier time giving up literally every thing they own for the church. 

In the US, however, story is different, because churches are one of the only places where a recent immigrant family can find Korean American community as well as important resources and knowledge. So in the US, Im pretty understanding of most Koreans-Americans being christians. Obviously, im pretty lucky in that my parents didnt really believe in most of those crap."
41,wc3cj8,"Real question that is genuinely being asked.

How do Christians reconcile celebrating lunar new year? Isn’t that pagan shit or do you guys just pick and choose what’s allowed"
42,wc3cj8,"Speaking from the perspective of a secular person growing up in a once third-world country, I didn't think so. 

Missionaries brought schools and hospitals (of course cynics will impute less-than-pure motives to these activities, which we can talk about but let's put that aside for now), and these were the conduits through which snatches of modernity were transmitted -- and at least in my country, it was done in a completely secular and non-coercive fashion. Much of the social mobility and opportunities I have today are a result of folks who did these things for non-worldly reasons, because there was so little money in them that even locals were not interested. 

I do think coercion of any kind is wrong (including religious coercion), but I never once felt coerced to adopt any religion. I attended Catholic school without much exposure to Catholicism at all (my mother too, although in her generation, they were required to attend religious services, but most students treated it with benign indifference). There were some converts who were pushy proselytizers, and I didn't like that, but I'm always careful to consider the merits of a system separate from the conduct of its most zealous adherents. After all, I remember being quite zealous myself in my younger days about Linux vs Windows (which was birthed from the belly of the Beast of Redmond) -- I now have more tempered views about operating systems.

The situation in Canada (different from the Lakota) was quite different in that there was coercion -- it was a program for forced assimilation, and it was incontrovertibly abusive and unforgivable. There were murders that were covered up. But the situation in Asia -- has nuances. It really depends on what country, when, and what was done. 

I think most people view history through the lens of contemporary morality (and if they're young, see the world as black and white, good and evil, and have a kind of simplistic morality) and don't understand that good and bad can sometimes coexist in the same entity. I saw a video on YouTube the other day about Fritz Haber (who invented the Haber process, if you remember your Chemistry). Fritz was German nationalist who invented a poison gas that was heavier than air so that the Germans would have a decisive victory in WW1 and so prevent more (German) lives from being lost (which was later used in WW2) -- but he also invented the process for manufacturing ammonia, which is used as fertilizer for agriculture in order to sustain the size of population today (today's population would not be possible without the Haber process). The very atoms in our bodies today owe  to Haber's contribution to agriculture. 

Was he a bad person or a good person? A modern person would say he was very bad. But I would say that the arc of history has shown that even from very bad things, good can come out of them. Morality is complex."
43,wc3cj8,"Oh my god, I’ve never heard this put so succinctly. Definitely stealing.

Also, I’m going to be honest—I grew up with various forms of Chinese religion and lots of critical thinking encouragement. I think spirituality is essential to human society and the wellbeing of both individuals and the world. 

And I think it’s impossible for intelligent and self-aware people who engage in critical thinking to actually subscribe to and thrive within a proscriptive, strictly organized religion."
44,wc3cj8,"Where is the lie? That statement is very true for both Christianity and Islam, even if the vast majority of converts adopted both religions peacefully through their children being raised in the faith

45,wc3cj8,"Figure I’ll give an alternate perspective since Reddit is generally anti-religion: As an Asian Christian my perspective is that if you believe in God, than he rules above all regardless of race (kind of the point of an “all-powerful” God). The act of being a Christ follower holds a higher power as a part of my identity than being Asian, because God is the one who made me Asian in the first place.

As for the worldly church, I do think that much of its historical background and details does stem from colonialism in terms of the traditions, the rules, the semantics, etc.

God is for all nations, and if you believe that you can only be saved through him, it makes sense to spread it. On the flip side, the legalism and actions taken to spread it is a different conversation. Jesus said to “go and make *disciples* of all nations”. Not, “go to other nations, conquer them, and force them to convert”.

**TL;DR- Christianity, alone, is a universal religion that transcends race and nations. Many of the methods in which it was spread, however, has had roots to violence and colonialism.**"
46,wc3cj8,"I mean Confucianism at the time became very dogmatized and in many ways after the Imjin War it provided the ideological basis in being even more repressive to women in Korea, and at the end of the day it wasn't a European power that colonized us, it was another Asian neighbor that did. 


So Christianity in Korea occupied a weird space of being both a tool for imperialism but also one of liberation for many in the bottom of the social caste, especially the butchers and the like, and after Japan took over Korea, it was seen as something more ""modern"" so that Korea could achieve independence and recognition from the West, as Japan wasn't too kind to Christianity and also many missionaries were from the very countries that would later fight Japan in WW2. Protestantism especially played a big role in the Korean independence movement, since many of them were from US and UK, and through organizations like YMCA they could organize and have points of contact & fundraising from Korean immigrants in the US. 


In fact, Catholicism first entered Korea after they'd read some of the works of catholic priests in China who had tried to proselytize there while they were importing ""Western Knowledge"" - works of astronomy, math, science, and philosophy and really general knowledge as well as Catholic Apologetics that Catholic priests sent to China were translating into Chinese. 

These works became popular by the scholars who saw the limits of Neo-Confucianism, and then some of them actually decided to convert after reading some of the apologetics, and sent someone to Beijing to contact the priests there to have the Pope send them their won priests. So its first introduction was not a foreign power spreading it with swords and guns. 

And the government, ruling under a strict Neo-Confucian ideology, saw Catholics as a dangerous cult that won't even do the ""Jesa"" -  the ancestor Ceremonial Rites - (also hugely tied with court politics I won't get into here b/c that would make this WAY tooo long of a post), and there were 4 major persecutions at least, 1801, 1839, 1846 and 1866. And all of these involved beheading the Catholics that would not apostatize. 


While it didn't start with imperialism however, Catholicism also did come in w/ some imperialist elements. 

As many Korean Catholics essentially becoming the enemy of the state, Catholics in Korea had no qualms ""betraying"" the country for a foreign power - such as Hwang Sa Young who was hiding out as a Catholic when the 1801 persecutions happened, and was caught with a letter to the Catholic priests in Beijing asking them to ask the Emperor to invade Korea and send military help. 


 And in 1866, after some French priests were beheaded along with roughly 8,000 other martyrs, the French sent a small naval force to attack Gangwhado, trying to influence Korea to open up and let Catholics be free to proselytize. 


It was probably this memory of persecution why Catholics in general were the ones more collaborative to Japan during the occupation era.


Protestants came over later after Korea opened up, in the late 1800s and they too occupied that same space of being both a liberating force and a forefront for imperialism. 

Prostestant groups, while a bit ironic for the 21st century, were the ones also pushing for social progress at the time, for women to get education (like Ehwa University) and in line w/ how many Prostestant groups also were the ones pushing for Women's Suffrage, it carried over to Korea where Protestantism offered freedom from the shackles of Confucian home life for women.

And more importantly as I noted above, Protestant missionaries came from Japan's would-be enemies in the US, who not only had a vested interest in the area unlike many Old World Catholic countries who could intervene (aka France), and so the network to the US the churches provided became vital to the independence movement. 

BUT

After the Korean war, especially during hte 70s and the 80s, the Catholic Church played a VITAL role as one of the pillars of the democratization movement. 

Cardinal Kim Sou Hwan, the highest ranking Catholic priest in Korea at the time, on a nationally televised mass for Christmas, criticized Park giving himself ""emergency powers"" (very much a Korean equivalent of the Enabling Act), saying

""There is no peace and happiness without love and justice. And there is no law and order without peace. What is even the benefit for the country to give the president emergency powers?"" 

And it was the Catholic Priests Association for Justice that played a VITAL role in smuggling the live footage of the Gwangju Massacre back into Korea (the same footage the German reporter Jurgen Hinzpeter smuggled out to the press, who was the basis for the film ""Taxi Driver"").

That footage was circulated among many Catholic churches to spread the truth about Gwangju, where the dictatorship had told the rest of the country that it was a ""disturbance"" from communist agitators. 

The piece of shit dictator Chun apparently even contacted the Vatican about trying to get Kim Sou Hwan censured by the Pope and their response was ""lol""

Kim Sou Hwan's finest hour was when a Seoul National Univ student Park Jong Chul died under torture and the police covered it up (basis for the movie 1987: When the Day Comes). 

After the Police told the press, verbatim, that the ""investigators slammed the desk 'BAM!' and the kid fell over and died"" and that there was no torture, he said in the mass that this answer from the government were ""the words of Cain,"" that the Chun regime lacked ""conscience and ethics"" and instead only had ""guns and cannons""

Later that year, when Koreans began to protest en masse in the June Uprising, some of the protesters fled to the Myeongdong Cathedral, the largest Catholic church in Korea, and hid there.

Cardinal Kim told the police, ""if the police try to arrest the students in the Church, I'll be standing right there, as will the priests and the sisters. Only after you arrest us you'll get to the students"" 

The military dictatorship, b/c they had to look nice to the rest of the world, especially the West, and because of its original sin in Gwangju, couldn't be as repressive to the Catholic Church as it meant angering the Vatican and numerous Catholic countries and creating another controversy at the wake of the Seoul Olympics in 1988. 

I personally am not religious but I definitely have a lot of respect for the Korean Catholic Church because of its history standing up to the dictatorship, as well as the fact that some of the priests that came to Korea after the Korean War were one of the more exemplary people that came to serve the poor. And they let my dad, who was an orphan at the time with a disability after suriving Polio, into the catholic school without tuition, and he still speaks very highly of especially the priest from Italy who was one of the Admins/Counselors there. The priest apparently was like 30 when he came over to Korea right after the Korean War, and then left Korea after it more or less became a middle income country by 1982, to serve in Kenya, then in his 60s he went to Sudan to build schools there and is still there. 

There are a LOT of problems in the Catholic Church especially in the West. But I do think the Catholic Church in Korea is an exception. 


Overall, I don't see it as bad because it's foreign. 

The prevailing ideology at the time was still very repressive to certain elements of society, and it offered a bit of respite from it, and moreover at the end of the day, it was a Buddhist/Shintoist majority country that colonized us. 

And the Catholics and some Protestant churches played big big roles in the fight for democracy (as did many Buddhist monks), and in fact even today Catholics tend to be more liberal in Korea"
47,wc3cj8,"Yes, I do. Even if it wasn’t always as brutal as what happened to indigenous tribes in the Americas."
48,wc3cj8,"Christianity (and pretty much most organized religions) preys on weaklings, so much so the Asian countries are often the target during last century.

52,wc3cj8,"Christianity is directly responsible for the development of public universities, public libraries, state-sponsored healthcare and the modern welfare state.

Christian ideals also directly evolved into the Western concept of individual protections such as freedom of speech and freedom of the press.

The Christian desire to spread their written Bible everywhere directly led to the transcription of thousands of non-European languages, included Taiwanese Hokkien.

It’s all perfectly well to criticize the church for its failures. But it’s successes in expanding literacy, promoting individual freedoms, and serving the poor should not be undervalued either"
53,wc3cj8,"I couldn't give a single flying fuck. Hate the oppressors, not the religion. Do you really think if Christianity didn't exist those the murderous maniacs of history wouldn't be murderous maniacs? They would have just as easily found another justification for their atrocities. 

You can dislike Christianity if it doesn't suit you, you can hate the genocidal maniacs of the past and present who used Christianity as a tool to manipulate the masses, but if you really think Christianity was the root cause of it all you're a fucking dumbass. 

The whole shtick in cartoons where you fuck with the past, come back to the present, and everything is futuristic because ""Christianity didn't become the prominent religion"" is just so fucking stupid, braindead, and a failed attempt to think critically. 

Think about it. Why did the Crusades happen? Not because of religion directly. Because of politics. Muslims had already been using war to expand their territory (and expanding territory is about claiming resources). The Church wanted to stop their expansion and not only reclaim the holy land, but reclaim other formerly Christian territories. It was a geopolitical war ffs. ""But if the religions never existed the wars would never have happened"" 

*Those* wars wouldn't have happened. But geopolitical wars is literally human nature to this very fucking day. Look at Ukraine and Russia ffs it has nothing to do with religion and it's still happening. And if the religions hadn't existed since the very beginning, it's still completely possible, maybe even probable, that different geopolitical history and tensions would have erupted in different, but not really different, wars in the same general time and place as the Crusades.

""Okay, but what about the repression of knowledge and science by the church? We definitely could've become more advanced without religion in the way"" No we couldn't you fucking idiot. Science wasn't repressed by the church. It was repressed by the fucking people.

Copernicus, the guy who discovered the sun was in the center of the universe, you know what happened to him? ""The Church killed the guy, probably."" Nope. The Church fucking celebrated and taught it to everyone. Because the ""center"" of the ""universe"" was seen as close to hell, so the Earth not being at the center meant we were further away from hell and closer to heaven than we realized. Hell, he was fucking employed by the Catholic church.

Later, around Galileo's time, the Catholic church had a big ass problem. People weren't going to Catholic churches, but rather protestant churches. What did the Catholic church do? What the two major political parties of America do every time a third party tries to get a foot in politics. They copied the tactics of the protestant church. One of which was denying science. Then they had Galileo put on house arrest for championing Copernican heliocentrism.

That's fucking right. *People*, not the church, decided to be anti-science, and the church just fucking adapted to stay relevant. Because that's how groups with power stay relevant. By appealing to the masses. You can't manipulate the fucking masses without appealing to them first.

So you can hate that historical meaning behind the presence of Christianity in your community. You can hate the genocidal maniacs who committed atrocities in the name of peace. You can choose not to believe in Christianity because of religious freedom. 

But you can't choose to hate Christianity itself. Because the step after that is to kill christians. People. You might not do that. But you'd be empowering the people who'd be willing to do that by sympathizing with their initial cause. And you'll just become part of the same stupid cycle of hatred and murder that humanity has been through since the beginning of its fucking inception."

I've recently been thinking, non-asians saying things like ""asians are too quiet and need speak up more to get their issues heard"" are pretty much stepping onto the line of victim blaming. We didn't choose to be silent, it's not our culture or other BS- we've *been silenced*. It's like telling the black guy in the office to ""stop acting so ghetto"" so their co-workers will take them seriously. If they've watched the Asian kid in school get bullied without doing anything, or maybe joined in theirselves, then they're just trying to find ways to excuse their complicitness in the systemic oppression of asians.

Wax has made controversial comments that have attracted national attention.[12] In an August 2017 piece in The Philadelphia Inquirer titled ""Paying the price for breakdown of the country's bourgeois culture"", she wrote with San Diego law professor Larry Alexander that since the 1950s, the decline of ""bourgeois values"" (such as hard work, self-discipline, marriage, and respect for authority) had contributed to social ills such as male labor force participation rates down to Great Depression-era levels, endemic opioid abuse, half of all children being born to single mothers, and many college students lacking basic skills. The authors asserted that ""all cultures are not equal. Or at least they are not equal in preparing people to be productive in an advanced economy.""[11][13] She told The Daily Pennsylvanian that ""everyone wants to go to countries ruled by white Europeans"" because of their ""superior"" mores. In the same interview Wax strongly emphasized that she did not believe in the superiority of one race over another, but was describing the situation in various countries and cultures.[14]

In a September 2017 podcast interview with Professor Glenn Loury, Wax said: ""Take Penn Law School, or some top 10 law school... Here's a very inconvenient fact ... I don't think I've ever seen a Black student graduate in the top quarter of the class, and rarely, rarely in the top half ... I can think of one or two students who scored in the top half in my required first year course,"" and said that Penn Law has a racial diversity mandate for its law review.[15][16] University of Pennsylvania Law School Dean Theodore Ruger responded, ""Black students have graduated in the top of the class at Penn Law, and the Law Review does not have a diversity mandate. Rather, its editors are selected based on a competitive process.""[17]

In July 2019, at the Edmund Burke Foundation's inaugural National Conservatism conference, Wax said, ""Embracing... cultural distance nationalism, means in effect taking the position that our country will be better off with more whites and fewer non-whites.""[18] She went on to explain that her ideas were about culture, and not about race, but the racial compositions of the societies in question led to most academics avoiding the topic entirely.[19]

In 2021, Wax wrote that ""the United States is better off with fewer Asians,"" claiming Asians vote disproportionately for the ""pernicious"" Democratic Party, which she called ""mystifying"" because the Democratic Party ""demands equal outcomes despite clear . . . group differences"" and ""valorizes blacks.""

2. Have an empty rally and be able to gauge the real level of support.

So now there's an empty rally, but that doesn't really mean anything in the long term - these aren't votes. And supporters can use this interference to maintain that levels of support are high, the rally just failed because of interference. I guess we stuck one in Trump's face, was that worth it? Seems like a long term self-own to me."

0,uflhtr,That’s great news. I also hope the museum will be big. There are so many stories to cover.
1,uflhtr,I'm very pleasantly surprised this passed unanimously.
2,uflhtr,"That's awesome to hear. I'd love the chance/opportunity to visit this museum once it's up and running. Hopefully the museum has the opportunity to continue to grow and expand as time goes by. 

Another place to put on my ""to visit"" list when I get the time and finances to travel again!"
3,uflhtr,There is an existing Museum of Asian Art fka Freer Sackler however its had big fetishization/white POV vibes.
4,uflhtr,"Sounds great, any potential consequences? Sometimes that happens.

Is this museum going to be directed by Asian Americans or non-Asians?"
5,uflhtr,Epic. I would love to visit it one day
6,uflhtr,[removed]
7,uflhtr,Always cheaper to commemorate the past than compensate the still-living.
8,uflhtr,"Wow. They passed it unanimously? I’m honestly shocked in a good way. It’s a big step, but it will take generations for people to give a shit/ accept the fact that Asian people actually have a long history in America and aren’t outsiders/newcomers."
9,uflhtr,😯 wow!! I never thought this would happen.  This is awesome 💗
10,uflhtr,Can’t wait to see all the salty tweets about how this passed unanimously. People did the same shit when that performative hate crime bill passed
11,uflhtr,"Timeline of Chinese Immigration to the United States

[https://bancroft.berkeley.edu/collections/chinese-immigration-to-the-united-states-1884-1944/timeline.html](https://bancroft.berkeley.edu/collections/chinese-immigration-to-the-united-states-1884-1944/timeline.html)

​ 1785 Three Chinese seamen arrive in the continental United States aboard the ship Pallas in Baltimore, MD.

1790 The Naturalization Act of 1790 restricts citizenship to “free white persons” of “good moral character.” The law would be enforced until 1952. In effect the Nation is divided between White and racial minority populations, each of whom would be accorded different and unequal rights and treatment. Racial minorities would be limited in their citizenship, voting, residency, jury, property, and family rights. Asian Americans, including Chinese Americans, would be directly affected by this legislation until it was rescinded by the passage of the Walter-McCarran Act of 1952.

1830 The first U.S. Census notation of Chinese in America records three Chinese living in the United States.

1830s Chinese sailors and peddlers visit New York.

......

1854 The California Supreme Court decision, People v. Hall, rules that Chinese cannot testify in court.

1858 California legally prohibits Chinese and “Mongolian” immigration.

1860 Chinese American population in US is 34,933 out of a total population of 31.4 million.

1862 The United States prohibits the importation of Chinese “coolies” on American vessels.

1865 Central Pacific recruits Chinese workers to build a transcontinental railroad.

1868 The United States and China ratify the Burlingame-Seward Treaty, which sanctions mutual emigration between the two countries.

1869 The first transcontinental railroad is completed with significant Chinese immigrant labor.

1870 Chinese American population in US is 63,199 out of a total population of 38.5 million.

1870 Congress approves the Naturalization Act, barring Chinese people from obtaining U.S. citizenship. The Act also prevents immigration of Chinese women who have marital partners in the United States. Chinese and Japanese men must show evidence in support of a woman’s moral character in the case of prospective and actual wives of Chinese and Japanese descent

13,uflhtr,"Cool, would anyone know where this museum would be located?"
0,jtd86l,"Here are the things I’ve learned recently about my Chinese relatives—a group of about 16 people—who came from the mainland:

-They’re terrified by affirmative action; they think it’s one of the most anti-Chinese policies that exists and will destroy their children’s futures

-They’re terrified by BLM and all it entails; they think systemic racism doesn’t exist and that black people will take over the country if this continues

-They’re terrified by the LBGTQ+ community; they think Democrats will pass laws forcing their children to become gay or trans

So that’s basically why they love Trump."
1,jtd86l,"A Kentucky Asian American here.  I feel like a lot of first-generation parents over here, though they are minorities, don't actually perceive themselves as sharing the same struggles.  My mother, for instance, doesn't think of me, as a half-Korean American, as a member of the Hanguk nation the same way she is.  Though she's faced discrimination and it's shaped who she is, she doesn't necessarily fit into the conversation of race I've inherited as a born and bred person over here.  When most of your interactions are white and in the suburbs, it's hard to take off the mask.  My folks are democrats, but I can see why a similar mentality might tend others toward the right.  But then there's the communist angle--my mom, who lived through the Korean War, is McCarthyesque compared to her more liberal perspectives."
2,jtd86l,"I think there are a lot of Chinese Americans who are single issue voters about affirmative action. My father was bombarded with messages from friends to vote Trump for that reason (he lives in a swing state). 

But really 60/30 in my mind is not that bad. As others said, it's not like we're a monolithic identity."
3,jtd86l,"What's crazy is  that I found out lots of Chinese Americans literally don't watch the news, they get the news from some Youtube channels that are so pro Trump. Those channels have so many fake news. Whenever I talk to a Chinese American Trumpper, he/she lay out absolutely fake shit, they forward news that are translated in misleading Chinese, almost like those FB dumb news memes you see. 


Honestly, some of them really really think they are better than others, they only think about themselves, they only ever want to move up (nothing wrong with that) and somehow they never learn empathy, they feel nothing for others‘ suffering. It's literally “don't be poor, work hard, learn coding“."
4,jtd86l,Because many Chinese rely on WeChat for news and information and they get a lot of shit misinformation telling them how bad the Dems are and they believe it. One example - my dad.
5,jtd86l,I’ve been seeing my Taiwanese-American/Canadian friends voicing support for Trump because “Hillary would’ve sold TW out to China.” I’m curious- why do you think so highly of the US? Because to me it seems quite clear that once TW is no longer useful against the US’s enemy (ugh) it would ditch it without a second thought. The US just doesn’t actually care. Just like how it preaches about human rights when it can leverage accusations for its benefit while abusing it domestically at the same damn time. Why do you think four more years of Trump would be beneficial? Is he a competent leader? Does he improve lives?  Are the dems not imperialistic enough for you? I just don’t get why you think the US actually cares about other/it’s own people so much...
6,jtd86l,I have zero patience for any Asian that voted for Trump.
7,jtd86l,"My guess is that Yang was surprised because he is a second-generation American-born Taiwanese American and his social circle doesn't involve that many Asian-American immigrants. Many of the pro-Trump AA voters seem to be refugees or people from countries where they equate Democrats with communism or socialism. I know for myself, none of my friends who are all in their early 30s or late 20s and born in the US or came at a very young age, support Trump whereas a lot of our boomer parents from China/Vietnam love him."
8,jtd86l,Asian American youth vote for Biden was 83% at least
9,jtd86l,"Because of a lot of the Chinese who come here are ""escaping communism"" and/or they're just straight up right-wing capitalists no matter what country they're in, and of course they'll support Trump. It's even worse with Vietnamese, Hong Kongers, Koreans, and Filipinos."
10,jtd86l,"I see nothing wrong with individuals in a group or demographic having individual opinions and values. X race should always vote Y doesn't sit well with me either. Asians (or Blacks, or Hispanics) should not be seen as a monolith!

I have big problems with groups with legitimate concerns being exploited through their fears."
11,jtd86l,The Chinese news in the Los Angeles area TV market kept focusing on how Biden supposedly took bribes from China and other misinformation.
12,jtd86l,"Disappointed, yes, but surprised.. that’s a little out of touch"
13,jtd86l,Because they’re weirdos. You see them all over Reddit too. Not majority but still loud enough for you to notice them.
14,jtd86l,"My in-laws are Asian and while the majority voted for Biden, one of my husband’s uncles voted for Trump. It was mind boggling to sit there and listen to him talk about why he voted for Trump, and one of his excuses was that he used to live in the south and sit at the back of buses when segregation was still a thing, so he of all people knows that racism doesn’t exist today.....like what? I don’t know how he can say that when I’ve witnessed my husband experience racism multiple times while with him. It’s offensive to his own family..."
15,jtd86l,I hope he gets a cabinet position.
16,jtd86l,"Disappointed? Yes, for sure. But if you're surprised you haven't been paying attention at ALL"
17,jtd86l,Do these people not experience racism? Or do they just stick to their view that they're better off than black people so it's ok?
18,jtd86l,I know of this one Gen X Trumper from China who lives in the US. She said all Democrats are “low IQ”
19,jtd86l,"That being said, like a lot of ppl’s parents here, it boggles my mind that no matter how many times I’ve tried to explain systemic racism to my very intelligent and hardworking mom, she just doesn’t get it. Same with other parents I’ve talked to. We’re not special. You came on an H1B and live in a fairly liberal suburb but this country isn’t all like that. However, I do appreciate that my own mother has firmly acknowledged that her support for Trump was a mistake and votes Biden this year. She’s still very conservative but had her eyes open the last four years..."
20,jtd86l,Am I disappointed? Sure. But I'm not surprised.
21,jtd86l,"What the hell is this clown talking about: Asians were the second-highest minority group to go for Biden, especially youth. It's depressing Yang has somehow turned himself into our media political representative."
22,jtd86l,"I try my best to talk to proTrump Korean aunties and uncles. Many of you in the comments are right: from what I’ve seen they simply want what benefits their own family and so are often single-issue voters. I can’t demonize them for not having the time to research everything carefully. One of my aunties is raising 3 grandkids and tending to a daughter going through a divorce while operating a business she’s run for decades. She thinks Trump benefits her because she got more business when he lowered taxes; I don’t think she computed how much her net earnings were after filing taxes at the end of the year. Her husband is a police officer and a really good man. They fly the Blue Lives Matter flag they don’t understand the racist connotations, they just want to celebrate him for his decades of service. He is more of a father figure to me than my own father, a really honorable man who was torn by what happened to George Floyd. 

It definitely sucks but I have to be patient as I explain things outside their media bubble and offer different policy solutions. They will not listen if I blame them and I don’t want to lose them. 

I won’t tell you what to do but please consider reaching out with empathy. Many of these people are not demons."

24,jtd86l,"lol how can republican asians see [this](https://youtu.be/4k4pMTsa1Kw?t=134) and be like, yes, this party is not racist"
25,jtd86l,"My parents don’t vote but they told me they preferred Trump. And they knew nothing about the election, policies, issues, whatnot. They’re naturalized citizens. Both have been getting news from WeChat so that may influence them."
26,jtd86l,"It’s been alarming that the QUARTER MILLION DEATHS THIS YEAR from the straight up DENIAL OF A PANDEMIC’S EXISTENCE in the 21st century when mass death from this shit is entirely preventable didn’t even enter ppl’s minds that that man isn’t fit to lead a country. 

Like it baffles me he got away with our utter non-response like that. Not even one of the first things that comes to mind about his administration... what the hell. Many of our family that immigrate here for political reasons value “freedom,” and this isn’t it. Letting people die, deluding them into blaming our problems on an “evil” foreign entity, denying and putting our problems off for the future, the news cycle publishing stories about how horrible our “enemies” are to hijack our attention when confronted with very real issues right here domestically.. fuck it. It was clear that the Trump admin (and the dems but that’s another convo) priorities AREN’T PRESERVING HUMAN LIFE. 

Also, climate change is here, AI is here... on an intl relations level blaming out problems on a foreign enemy isn’t gonna make out domestic problems “go away” as they have so far, at all. I really fucking hope we can turn things around very soon. I’ve thought about leaving in the near future to live in China but this is my home, and I live this place and these people. Please be well."

0,hfmcl3,"Found this on /r/worldnews, and of course most of the top comments are denying any racism exists against Asian Americans. Fucking sickening to me."
1,hfmcl3,"I've posted about this before but I recently moved to Vancouver BC from the NYC metro area and I am surprised as hell by the amount of anti-Asian rhetoric and hate I have heard from people who are often speaking very casually about it. Where I'm from we had a bunch of every race, every group is represented pretty much. Here in Vancouver the minority population is almost exclusively East Asian and South Asian, there are hardly any black, hispanic, or middle eastern people. The east asian population is huge and over these last several months I have just heard a shit ton of people spewing both casual racist statements about them and sometimes even very vile racist statements. I'm a brown guy and I've heard this from both white and brown neighbors, colleagues, and even friends. I've heard so much of it in my industry (investments/banking) which is very white-collar and largely white. I've heard it in random places like while having a casual chit-chat with the receptionist at my doctor's office, I've heard it from my neighbors both directly and overhearing them talking to others while on their porch. People will just say things to me assuming I share those thoughts. Its like the justified fear we have as minorities about the racists things that some white people say about us among themselves, and now its as if its become ""accepted"" or assumed that everyone shares an anger and hatred towards east asians. I'm actually shocked we haven't seen more violence given the level of vitriol I've been noticing."
2,hfmcl3,"I'm in CA and never suspected being judged for being Asian during the pandemic, until yesterday... obviously can't confirm it was racism, but went to drop some things off at Goodwill and the Mexican guy was oddly dismissive, not making eye contact. In a rude tone, told me to put everything in one of the bins then walked off.

I went to a low scale Mexican supermarket on the way home after that, and I similarly had stares from some customers and a dismissive vibe from the store clerks. The fact that they were all in the same area, same ethnicity, and same social class (Santa Barbara lower class Mexicans) makes me think this could have been the result of racist gossip shared between them. That, and literally no one else that day gave me any stares or cold remarks. It's understandable, but sad to see ... especially with the narrative of minorities supporting each other and all that."
3,hfmcl3,"Before the pandemic, as an Asian American I know most Americans aren't exactly fond of people like me, but the majority of anti-immigrant sentiment is directed at Mexicans and Arab Muslims. By and large, at least before the pandemic, anti-Asian hate in America was mostly localized. The majority of Americans don't even know we exist and if they saw us, are more likely to think that we're tourists.

So I can't imagine what it must be like in Canada where a combination of Asians being the second biggest minority, the influx Mainland Chinese millionaires, and the diplomatic clusterfuck involving Meng Wanzhou has made us the biggest immigrant boogeyman. 

What I find funny is that the Canadian government hopes immigration could boost their population to 100,000,000 by 2050 to boost the country's competitiveness. But an East Asian population that constitutes about the same proportion to the population as Asian Americans is already making the commonfolk in Canada shit bricks."
4,hfmcl3,was coughed on before lockdown started as well. told the police and nothing happened :(
5,hfmcl3,"It's so bizarre to me that any place with a huge Asian population also has so many people who hate Asians. 

Is it because it's more likely to have encounters when the Asian population is large? Is it because people don't like having a huge group of people move in?"
6,hfmcl3,not shocked tbh
7,hfmcl3,I am afraid this will just get worse.

2,c0fhc1,My man rode the pine like nobody else 😤😤 💪💪
3,c0fhc1,My man put up some points during the playoff run and even got to play a minute in the finals. #contributing
4,c0fhc1,Close to home in the Bay Area against the team that gave him his start. Full circle indeed.
5,c0fhc1,"David Chang [tweeted](https://twitter.com/davidchang/status/1139370193065394176) ""Nick Nurse please put in Jeremy Lin. He is the prince that was promised. Do it."" LOL."
6,c0fhc1,"sigh. 

Wish it was under different circumstances."
7,c0fhc1,"Jokes aside, Jeremy Lin did make actually make meaningful contributions to the Raptors season.

The Raptors acquired Lin during a crucial time near the end of the season when Fred VanVleet was out for over a month after surgery for a thumb injury. Lin played 23 regular games for the Raptors, averaging 19 mins/game. He averaged 13.4 pts and 4.0 ast per 36 mins.

By helping hold down the fort, the Raptors were able to hold onto their #2 seed in the Eastern Conf. The Raptors needed Game 7 at home to beat the Sixers in the Conf Semifinals. If they couldn't hold onto the #2 seed, Game 7 would have been in Philly, and they probably would have lost.

Unfortunately, in the playoffs, Coach Nurse went old school and decided that he would go with a strict 8 man rotation, and the other 5 players on the roster never played except garbage time. I have no doubt Lin could have helped the Raptors in the playoffs, especially against PHI and MIL when VanVleet was in a massive month-long slump.

But it is what it is. At least Lin made meaningful contributions to the Raptors overall season."
8,c0fhc1,Raptors are NBA champions after Lin came on the team. Coincidence? I don't think so.
9,c0fhc1,"Wow, he's #2 trending on Twitter right now, behind Klay (and probably for related reasons, Melo is #11)"
10,c0fhc1,Came here expecting to see this exact shitpost. Thanks for not disappointing.

12,c0fhc1,"he sacrificed a lot for this championship. he/they deserve it

👍"
13,c0fhc1,Hell yeah he is
14,c0fhc1,I see this as an absolute win.

24,c0fhc1,As meaningful a ring as like Luke Walton's in 2009
25,c0fhc1,I can’t support this. I’m Bay Area.
26,c0fhc1,"Wtf, people? Do not upvote this shit. All the people yelling this on /r/nba are basically making fun of him.

Edit: It really is a weird thing to celebrate. Are people really so obsessed with rings that it doesn’t even matter how you got them? He didn’t play! I’ll celebrate Lin’s actual accomplishments, not this."
27,c0fhc1,Kept that bench warm like no one else 💪💪💪
28,c0fhc1,Undeserving that's for sure LooooL
29,c0fhc1,"Been a follower of his ever since I came across the Harvard UConn game and saw an Asian guy lighting it up. And I've been through all the ups and downs in his career with him, but this... this is not something I imagine that he's completely happy with. No true competitor would be because he contributed very little to the success of the Raptors this year. Hopefully, he'll be given one more chance in the league to show what he can do."

6,lbwqi3,"First I wanna start by saying this is obviously and deliberately racist and disgusting and I 100% condemn this.

Second, I have a genuine question. When COVID first started making headlines, it was known as Wuhan virus and some people were saying it's racist because diseases shouldn't/aren't named after places. This is highly confusing to me as the following is a short list of diseases named after places: West Nile virus, MERS, Spanish flu, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, African Sleeping Sickness, Ebola, and Lyme disease.

So why is calling it Wuhan virus or even Chinese coronavirus racist? I understand that it led to anti-Asian hate and attacks, but I think that might have happened even if it wasn't given an overtly Chinese name, like how xenophobia increased against Africans in the Ebola panic.

Can someone please explain?

what really pisses me off about dog eating jokes is that my mom's family ate dog- my uncle's dog. why?

because of famine. 

I wouldn't be here if it weren't for that dog. My uncle loved his dog. He didn't eat that night out of sorrow. Nearly killed him physically. He still talks about that dog nearly 60 years later.

I'm a bit more cynical. My gut tells me none of that matters if you are in a sub/forum/community that isn't actively pro-Asian. Non-Asians will let micro-aggressions and racist statements towards Asians slide because we are not viewed as real minorities or people of color. Attacks on our humanity are normalized and seen as OK and they continue to be seen that way despite the surge in representation and visibility in recent years. 

The most effective thing we can all do is to call it out when we see/hear it in person. That creates discomfort and the transgressor has to face a human being when confronted with their racism. Online, people just choose to ignore and disengage."

15,a0qioe,"Meh. I'm sure white people ate dogs during the Revolutionary War and Civil War. If food supplies are short, dogs are gonna look tasty. Hillbillies in the south eat road kill and I find that just as disgusting. White Canadians eat beaver which I also find disgusting. Europeans eat horses, which again I find disgusting. 

Growing up, I've heard this crap over and over again. It doesn't phase me anymore. Either ignore it or stand your ground and point out the flaws in white people cuisine. Fake cheese, pounds of butter, bacon wrapped everything, roadkill, beaver, horse, etc. 

This is my theory and it's a long shot theory, but I believe that a lot of white Americans poke fun of other cultures because they honestly don't have one themselves. Their entire culture is a set of derivatives of other cultures. Rock n Roll? Yep, black people did that first. Jazz? Black people. Hip Hop? Black people. Best southern foods? Yep, black people. Chipotle? Mexicans. Even the white foods that they cherish so much are derivatives from Europe. So what the fuck do they have? Jamba Juice?  Some of them try to claim their european heritage and the europeans give them shit. The have nothing and we have thousands of years of tradition, literature and art coursing through our veins. 

The also like to point out how ""dirty"" certain cultures are. Bitch please. They're the dirtiest ones. This is a group of people that killed a bunch of native americans by coughing on them. They are plague carriers. Point out all these flaws and they will shut the fuck up. 

If anyone is going through a cultural identity crisis it's them not us. They hate it when people of color are proud of their heritage because they don't have one. Other than ""muh constitution"" and the pilgrims, they don't have shit and they know it. 

Keep working hard, ace your exams, get into the best school you can and snatch their jobs. They've gotten lazy, complacent and entitled. This is your chance to seize power and claim their shit. Their voices will be drowned out soon enough. Don't worry about it. "

20,a0qioe,"Why do you guys treat dog eating as a negative thing? I personally don't eat dogs, but I don't judge people who eat them. And if a white person talk shit about dog eating, well.. sucks to be them, nobody gonna stop eating."
21,a0qioe,"Any comment like that. There was a thread on r/melbourne where this indian woman called out creepy indian men and it became a cesspool breeding ground for anti-indian racist comments. I've seen plenty of ""asian people eat dog"" comments or ""muslim people are terrorists"" which fucking stink. Especially because you know that any comment that insinuates anything negatively stereotypical about white or black people would get sent to the bottom."

23,a0qioe,"I don't see the issue with eating dogs, but I know for many people it's triggering because it's used as a racial taunt in the same way as ching chong, can't drive, dork etc stereotypes 

The carnivore argument doesn't hold because (1) dogs are actually omnivores and (2) seafoods are more often than not omnivorous and White people love seafood.

If we're going to go by the logic that it's just ~intuitively~ gross, I actually find the thought of eating any primate (gorilla, orangutan, proboscis monkey, chimpanzee, human etc) to be much more ""intuitively gross"" than eating a dog.

0,nm7imo,"i'm also tired of trying to talk to other POC about it, most others are supportive but a lot buy into the model minority myth among other things and use it as an excuse to be racist towards asians :/"
1,nm7imo,"Tired of trying to educate people and them saying ""I'm attacking the country/government, not the people"" 

Sure thing, you only meant to say the CCP or a mass of land is eating bats. Some people just don't apologize for their BS :/"
2,nm7imo,I'm tired of trying to convince people that all of the recent attacks on Asians are real. So many folks want to say that it **isn't** racism and that it's just coincidence or somehow made up by the media to pit POCs against each other.
3,nm7imo,"There is no mystery here. We have just been too polite in our explanations.

Now, I just change the subject and go back to it in a few sentences. Same scenario but with their race substituted in. I change my voice inflection so that it is friendly to their brand of racism. And when they predictably agree that is ""horrible"". I drop all pretense and humor,  ask them why is that okay to do to an Asian. 

To be wholly honest I rarely get a moment of enlightenment. Instead I almost always get hit with nonsense, justification. I like to believe, later when they are alone, they are moved a little closer to our point of view. But honestly the best part is that they know not to ever come at me with that BS again. And that is not a small thing. 

I do not do this in a way that I am trying to push people away. I do this to friends that I hope to stay friendly with. But I do make sure that a boundary has  been observed. I know I am starting to sound like an internet tough guy, I am not. But we do have to start standing up for ourselves and our community."
4,nm7imo,"Hi, tired here too and actually proud of myself for getting ready to walk away from this recent convo:

White Dude: I don't understand why Asian Americans are being attacked!  
Me: It's the culmination of a long and multifaceted history. \[3 min potted summary of 1870s railroad workers, anti-miscegenation laws especially targeted at Filipinos, \[forgot to bring up migrant farmworkers and interment camps\], limited lifting of immigration caps and rise of model minority myth, previous president's racism and linkage of COVID to China\]  
WD: I don't understand why Asian Americans are being attacked!  
Me: Ok, I just explained this  -  
WD: But I don't need an explanation, I want to discuss -

Thankfully a white lady busted in right at that moment and started talking about what she had learned from different generations of Asian American Buddhists during one of her weekly Zooms, and we were able to reframe the convo and mostly keep him out of it until I was calmed down and could organically leave. I don't know if she did it on purpose, but it helped! I wasn't ready to fight, and didn't want to.

I'm still learning that it's ok to walk away, and that it's not my job to educate white people. Thanks for this article and for all the reminders/shared experiences in the comments.

Love and strength (though I wish we didn't have to be so fucking strong all the time) to you all."
5,nm7imo,"The most upsetting thing that’s been repeated to me is that apparently we Asians “got justice” because an anti Asian hate bill got passed. This is far from the truth and very divisive of minorities. Hell, I’ve even had other POC tell me that Asian Americans don’t have it bad."
6,nm7imo,"It is not surprising if you feel tired, and it is beyond okay to feel tired. It is huge emotional labor to get people to understand how their behaviors harm you and people you hold dear, and it sucks that despite the fact that it is others' behavior that is harmful, the labor falls on you. Pragmatically, there's not a good way about it, unfortunately.

But when you feel tired, know that it's okay to be tired, and to step back. Focus on your own mental health, and make sure you are doing okay. It's too easy to become consumed by this: for the tiredness to spiral into negativity into hopelessness or hate. The movement is bigger than any one of us, and there is an endless amount of work to do. That work will still be here tomorrow, in a week, and in a year. So please empower yourself to engage in self-care and take a step back and heal yourself when you need to.

This looks different for everyone. Sometimes, it's saying, ""I don't have the energy to engage right now."" Sometimes, it's pulling a friend over and saying, ""hey, I need to rant, and I just need an ear, can you listen, no judgment?"" Sometimes, it's lying in bed and listening to your problematic fave. (Their music is so good but they're so trash? why??)

Please feel able to step away. Don't worry: the world won't burn down while you're away - if only because it is already a bit of a dumpster fire :)"

I've seen some of you (CC: u/510119331816211 u/KumquatBeach ) talk about how other minorities/POC are only supportive in a very shallow way, or entirely dismissive. I've seen some of you (CC: u/handicapybara great name btw, u/Intact ) talk about how people made bad-faith critiques of governments littered with age-old racism and apply tropes and stereotypes to said government almost like a sort of dogwhistle so they can just be blatantly racist with a thin veneer of plausible deniability. Some of you (CC: u/MsNewKicks u/454_water u/worlds_okayest_user ) discussed how hard it is to convince people that these attacks, this discrimination, this racism, *does* exist.

For all that is good in the world, we Jews know exactly how you feel. It's awful neat that we get to share a heritage month since we have such similar problems here, and on behalf of indigenous West Asians broadly, I'd like to say I'm sorry you've all been struggling with everything going on. With circumstances out of your control being politicized against you. With bigots using politics to justify their hatred. With violence against you, with people unwilling to listen to you, to hear you out, to understand you. With those who profess their nominal support turning their backs on you when you need them. 

We can get through this. We can overcome. We can work together to help others understand our unique, and precarious, position. Stay strong, friends. Happy Asian Heritage Month, from West to South to East, we're all in this together."

I was a bit peeved when I went to our local theater for the CRA opening day to find that it was tucked away at one of the smallest theater rooms in the back. It was still a sold out show but it goes to show that the theater (ours was AMC) didn’t expect this movie to do as good as it did - a bit of a micro aggression almost. It also goes to show we still have ways to go. "

5,9cqic6,"Good. I know it was a little late, but I went and watched it with my parents. At first I didn't know what to expect because I've read the first book and it was okay, but mostly I think the direction of the book was more interesting because it explored Astrid's side more and I thought was more interesting. They did some details out that was definitely understandable. What really surprised me was that my dad, who usually falls asleep in rom-coms, didn't fall asleep at all in this one and was awake the entire time. 

&#x200B;

Personally, I think it definitely hit me and my eyes felt as if I just cut a ton of onions. I could see why it was so powerful to have an all Asian cast, and definitely those subtle comments that only Asian Americans could get. The one that made me laugh was the guilt tripping line. It was so subtle, and it was just me and my fiancee who caught and laughed at it in the theater.  It wasn't a normal rom-com and it was just extremely relatable, maybe not on the story, but just the culture itself. Things like never being good enough, someone's always better, etc. for an Asian growing up in America it was something I felt all the time. I'm glad I went to go watch the movie and felt super connected to the movie and the culture."

1,pxw0qt,[deleted]
2,pxw0qt,I've always just called those from the homeland from the motherland. There are for sure differences in our thoughts and experiences as Asian Americans - and it does not invalidate either of our experiences.
3,pxw0qt,Lmao I remember a mainland Korean told me I wasn’t Korean because I wasn’t born in Korea nor did I speak the language fluently 😂
4,pxw0qt,"Yep. Asians from Asia don't face the same issues as we do here in North America. Don't even get me started with white people who weaponize this to push us down further more because they live(d) in Asia. Just because we were born outside of the continent, it doesn't make us any less Filipino, Cambodian, Thai, Vietnamese, etc. than mainlanders. It annoys me to bits when my struggles are invalidated by those who don't experience life in the diaspora."
5,pxw0qt,"I've had a Chinese person tell me some white people are more Chinese than me. 

That was nice."
6,pxw0qt,"Yes! And it's something that needs to be talked about.

IME ""Asian Asians"" often treat Asian-Americans as ""discount white people"" - a group that possesses the cluelessness and entitlement of 鬼佬 without having the white face to ""justify"" it. Our experiences are minimized and dismissed as irrelevant or inconvenient to the worldview they hold, of Westerners being one way and Asians being wholly another. They abhor the idea that there might exist individuals, communities even, who comfortably not only navigate, but reside within the divide.

A lot of us grew up being told by our families that we weren't Asian enough, and by American society that we weren't American enough. Now that Asian issues have the spotlight it's frustrating to see ""mainlanders"" (note: do NOT call Hong Kongers that lol) publicly dismiss our experiences and perform ""everything is fine"" or ""this is how things ought to be"" for white people."
7,pxw0qt,This whole post is 🔥🔥🔥
8,pxw0qt,"Remember that big press incident a few years back about a white girl wearing a red qipao to her prom and posing in a way that was at the very least racially suggestive, if not racist? Everyone was quick to point out that born and raised mainland Chinese said it seemed like a case of cultural appreciation, not appropriation, without any care for the nuance of being a minority in a white-dominant society and, I don’t know, literally hundreds of years of codified racism in our nation’s history? 🙄

I don’t even bother trying to explain it anymore because I just get talked over by white people clambering to prove that they have a more valid opinion about racism than a person of color."
9,pxw0qt,"Man where are all these uptight Asians? I grew up in HK, moved to US for high school, so I guess I was an Asian-Asian for a while technically...

But every Chinese mainlander I've met in my adult life (well, okay, besides one stereotypical rich Chinese exchange student that insisted HK was China), I usually find a sense of 
camaraderie with them, even though we usually speak different dialects. 

It did take me a while to get over the xenophobia I was taught about mainlanders in HK though, and as I matured I realized that a lot of the stereotypes I learned about mainlanders were just like the mexican/south american stereotypes I see in CA. Same fuckin shit just used to other an ""unwanted"" demographic."
10,pxw0qt,"Where is this coming from? I might be a bit out of touch but I've never seen this type of animosity between those from the motherland and foreign born Asians. I've certainly never seen those from the motherland be called ""mainlanders"" except maybe for Chinese in mainland China. It's an odd word to use

It's almost like there's a disinformation to bring a wedge between the two."
11,pxw0qt,"Put bluntly, if it's Asians in Asia opining about Asian American social experiences in America and our outlooks, who cares about they think? As far as I'm concerned, their opinions don't mean jack fucking shit."
12,pxw0qt,"regardless, this type of conversation lets out the people who arent open minded and those who actually are. 

Though I am pretty specific on these types of topics. I tell people im Chinese but im culturally American because of raised here. That should be enough detail to describe who you are"
13,pxw0qt,"Was talking to this in another thread where there were clearly Asians in the sub who were resentful of ""white washed"" Asians. The reality is the white wash demographic was created as a result to separate themselves from the insufferable nationalistic assholes that some mainlanders become. The reality is people who behave like this have a sad life. Their sole identity as an individual is ""I'm from X."" Literally nothing else. So much so that if you don't share the traits THEY believe is important in making you their race, they will outright call you ""Not really X or Y."" In my case Korean. I've been told I'm not Korean by kids who were born in America and never set foot in Korea because I don't have a broken English accent and I don't only have Korean friends. Fuck these people because 1st of all, guarantee I'm more Korean than they are. Half these people can't even recount Korean history and revision history to make it more flattering for Koreans like we were never in poverty or our country never really suffered after Japan was defeated (lol sounds like they don't know South Korea's dictator who got shot by his 2nd in command). These people also revision history to never acknowledge the fact that Korea had a heroin epidemic.

It's insane. Then you realize these mainlanders who DO behave like this? Are basically your country's version of the alt right/InfoWars-like crew bitching about white and Christian straight men being turned gay due to liberalism. Nationalism is a concept that needs to die and people should no longer follow."
14,pxw0qt,"As someone who grew up in Asia, I definitely agree that it's a problem with racists using the perspectives of Asians from Asia as a beat stick against Asian Americans, and it really breaks my heart because it's a perspective that was hard for me to understand at first, what it's like to live as a minority. 

At the same time, in the same way that Asian Asians don't fully understand Asian American culture and shouldn't speak for it, neither should Asian Americans discount the perspectives of Asian Asians and assume that they don't know anything, or pretend to speak to a full Asian experience. 

The my culture is not a dress is the classic example of that because both sides were talking over each other. The Asian perspective failed to understand the sensitivity of white washing, the xenophobia, discrimination and otherness that many of you have experienced. 

At the same time many Asian Americans failed to understand that the Qipao itself is derivative from Western dress, and it's ridiculous to say that Westerners shouldn't wear it. 

Personally I think that while Asian Americans were entitled to a sense of injustice in that case, it was a little unfair to shoulder the fury of that injustice on the girl who wore the qipao, because she was not the one perpetuating the wrong, she was merely a scapegoat and the lightning rod. 

But of course, you're entitled to disagree, we all have different perspectives and should understand them better."

Missing from these articles: an author saying he was raised in an anti-Asian household, but as he grew older, he became aware of these biases and changed and has been an ally in his workplace, church, and family. (Anti-Asian racism existed before this. The people who grew up hating Asians definitely exist. I encountered them as a kid. They repeated what their parents said. What happened to them as they grew up, I’m not sure.)

Living in the west coast, you’d think there would be greater coverage of this fact. Unfortunate and predictable to see there were no Chinese “present” during the final commemorative photo."
1,iyx0iy,"i went to an asian majority high school (and junior high & elementary) in southern california and i swear asian-american history was only mentioned in passing; i think we only learned about the chinese immigrants building the railraods, the chinese exclusion act, and japanese internment. and i don't ever recall asian americans being talked about before high school. kinda sucks i know basically next to nothing about the history of asian americans and the only way to find out more is to seek it out myself.

i've recently learned from one of my classes that the reason why we have strong direct democracy in CA is because of groups like the Progressives and the Workingmens party. but those groups were very strongly anti-asian.  LOL kinda sucks that the root of strong direct democracy in CA is stained with anti-asian racism"
2,iyx0iy,"This has been long overdue. Our education system has done jack shit to address asian am history, and it shows in how ignorant people in CA are about asians. Our state was built on the backs of these workers-if there was no railroad, there'd be no prosperous California.

I usually wondered about the details and sometimes voiced my questions, to often be told it wasn't a relevant topic to ask about. 

I learned all my Asian history in college (and books like *Farewell to Manzanar*) when I deliberately took *Pre-Asian History* as an elective offered in 2 sections with Pre- for Fall semester and Modern- for Spring semester. I almost didn't get credit for the class.

I was furious when I learned in class how much was swept under the rug by the Western storytelling. My professor was this really cool white lady who lived in Singapore and I actually felt reaaaally humbled by how much she knew about my peoples and was the brave one to essentially advocate for us.

--Also, Genghis Khan's first name is pronounced more like, ""Jengus"" with a soft G. Lao and Khmer are how she identified Laotians and Cambodians too.

4,8rbuuz,"Not sure if this is already included in the report, but here's a [visualization of the data in Table 5.6R and Table 5.1R](https://imgur.com/a/fQANRiS). Here, the x-axis shows the applicants as grouped by race. The y-axis shows the fraction of applicants that receive a personal score rating of greater than 2 (1 being best, 10 being worst) from the admissions committee (blue) and alumni (orange), normalized by the total fraction of applicants that received a >2 personal score, as the alumni were significantly more generous than the committee across the board. The error bars are just 3-sigma counting errors, assuming a Poisson distribution. The grey band shows the 3 sigma error about 1.0 (i.e. the case where all ethnicities receive statistically equal personality scores).

First, you can see that there is a very significant (i.e. enough so that I didn't bother to compute the statistical significance) between the alumni and committee evaluations, as has been already stated. Also very interesting to note that alumni tended to rate Black and Hispanic applicants lower in personality than white and Asian applicants. Still more interesting is that both the admissions committee and the applicants rank white applicants more highly in personality than any minority.

The point I'm trying to make is that, given the assumption that the distribution of ""personality"" is independent of race -- which I believe is very reasonable -- there is evidence that race plays a factor in the consideration of an applicant's personal score (which apparently is a significant factor in their admission decision). Oh, and please let me know if I have any bugs in my analysis, I have to admit I did it very quickly :)"

The assumption appears to be that blacks and other racial minorities are blocking the way of Asians, but as the article itself mentions ""White applicants would be most hurt if Asian-American admissions rose."" Even if Asians swallowed up the 10% of slots held by black students at Harvard, they'd still be ""underrepresented"" if only test-scores were considered, and Asians would need to take a big chunk out of the white pie to get an allotment that would satisfy them.

I am not an Asian person. But it strikes me as reasonable that universities consider other factors outside of academic test scores when admitting students, and that one of these factors is reflecting the wider society. Asians make up maybe 9% of the U.S population, if all universities started looking at only test scores they'd make up upwards of 40% of all student bodies at many of the top schools. How is this good for the country? Also, it is well known that Asian culture places an extreme amount of importance on scholastic achievement and getting good test scores. Asian children can spend years going to cram schools and preparing for the SAT. Why should non-Asian children be punished just because they did not grow up in a culture like that? Just my thoughts... I am not bigoted against Asians but this is what I think when I read an article like this.

1,kd56wb,"I'm not korean but I think as a 1.5 gen I can explain some of the mentality.

With the economic growth of asia now everyone is more nationalistic, however, at least in chinese communities, the previous generation came over to the ""new world"" and is quite...evangelical about confirming to the norms of the west, where everything ""white"" is better and their number one wish for their kids is to fit in. There's a kind of self-doubt/self-hatred where some parents would purposely not try to teach their kids the native tongue in fear of giving their kids an accent.

Fast forward two decades and (east) asian countries made huge strides economically and culturally, South Koreans and (mainland) Chinese people takes much more pride in their native culture now and they see ABCs who don't speak the native tongue as a reflection of that generation that was ashamed of their own culture. In a way, they are looking at you as a product of the (relative) poverty of the previous generation, a decade where one has to suck it up to the unfairness of the new world (ie. when faced with racism, the older generation immigrants would just see it as the price of living in america, whereas the newer generation of immigrant would be less likely to just ""take it"").

For chinese people at least, if they see someone who don't speak the mother-tongue, their first assumption is that this is someone who didn't take enough pride in their heritage to make an effort to learn the language and it's pretty much a dogwhistle to them of that history of self-hating, and the amount of effort spent by the previous generation to try to fit into a society that they have since realized they could never fit in just because of the color of their skin.

It's not your fault obviously, it's just one of the ways where the collective psyche that stemmed from history is larger than one's individuality."
2,kd56wb,"Chinese descent here and occasionally run into people who believe I have betrayed the motherland by not being able to have a conversation in Chinese. I can speak a few words. Tbh most of my US born cousins don't speak or read either. I have some regrets -- these past 2 years I've been going through my mom's letters and photos, and cannot read them."
3,kd56wb,"literally!! i asked my parents so often when i was young to teach me how to speak their languages, but no (i still dont get why). now when i try to practice, my american accent is so bad so my korean friends make fun of me so i stop"
4,kd56wb,"I've been there so I feel you. When I was younger my dad would make comments about the fact that I didn't speak Korean even though he never enforced it in the house. And there were definitely adults who would make comments about it. That shit stung when I was little and I always made me feel ashamed of not being able to speak it. It honestly made me very embarrassed to even try.

I started dating native Koreans which helped a lot. My wife is the primary reason I can speak as well as I can now. Still far from fluent but I can definitely have conversations with people. And because of that I get to have a relationship with my in-laws and my wife's relatives. I get to connect with my relatives in Korea who I was never close with before. 

I'm glad you didn't let those who judged you bring you down. It's not easy learning a language and I know how hard it was for me to get to the level where I am now so I definitely empathize. Hope you keep learning and growing."
5,kd56wb,"It's because when people see us, they don't see an individual, but a monolithic representative for our entire race. 

The moment we walk into a room, whether or not we like it, most people have preconceived notions and expectations of the sort of person you must be. 

There are plenty of Italian Americans or Irish Americans who proudly boast about their heritage despite never having visited their ethnic originated countries or even speaking the native languages there. It's because in society's eyes, they've achieved the full process of Americanization, already just by being white (I am aware of the prejudice these communities faced in the past) but when it comes to being an Asian person living in America we are already seen as foreigners. 

Don't worry about it"
6,kd56wb,"They (usually older Asian immigrants) see it as you not embracing or rejecting your heritage. Language is heavily tied to culture and identity, so it makes sense in some ways.

That said, it’s kind of dick attitude, given it’s not exactly your fault. Moreover, this attitude actually makes it more difficult for people to learn the language because now success or failure becomes embroiled in shame and anxiety over their identity. Learning another language usually is already difficult and stressful on its own, so it’s not really helpful to pressure or make people feel ashamed if they’re struggling with it. 

Honestly, I give you props for being able to learn Korean despite that. People don’t realize what a huge a struggle it is to try and learn a heritage language. It doesn’t make you less Asian or Korean if you didn’t speak your heritage language, though."
7,kd56wb,"Ignore the people who say that to you.  You’ll be judged even if you knew your parent’s language. I took a class in my parent’s native language, for example, and my professor literally treated me differently and gave me harder exams than everyone else just because she thought I was a native speaker, even though I’m not - I only knew like a couple phrases but just because everyone else didn’t all of a sudden it looked like there was a huge difference between me and the others in terms of both culture and language. 

You’ll be judged either way."
8,kd56wb,"There is absolutely **nothing** wrong with you, it's them. 

Hardly anyone pressures a white dude or girl to know their European language lol, even though all the white people you see in America had ancestors from...well, Europe. Their Americaness is not questioned, neither should yours. The double standard is pure racism, period.

The assholes you speak about are essentially trying to affirm the perpetual foreigner BS that's plagued Asian Americans for years. The 'foreigner' crap is one of the main reasons why so much crime and racism against Asians in the West has been committed during the coronavirus pandemic. 

If you were actually from Asia literally and grew up there that's one thing, but as an **American**, you should never feel pressured to bend your identity this way and that because some people see the color of your skin instead of respecting your citizenship and Americaness. Asian-Americans, like African-Americans and ""White""-Americans (lol) are just as much a part of this country, end of story.

Maybe an unpopular opinion, but it is a damn shame that so many Asians, even if unintentionally and indirectly, actually embolden the 'not-really-American' trope by doing the condescending things you talked about in your post, as well as the dumb ""whitewashed"" accusations just because an Asian-American has this hobby or listens to that type of music etc."
9,kd56wb,People are so judge mental. I have a similar situation. Korean for me too. My parents were constantly working so I didn’t really talk to them much growing up. Now I have almost no knowledge of my parents language. When we visited grandparents abroad they scoffed at how my sis and I could barely communicate with them. Not our fault our parents were never home. I have Hispanic friends that get looked down on a lot for the same thing. That they don’t speak Spanish fluently and don’t look white.
10,kd56wb,"West Coast culture is different. People kind of take it for granted that Asians are in abundance here. Many are also second generation immigrants so they aren’t entirely far removed from their culture or language since many of their own parents have limited English skills. For many Asian families it’s a sign of being a good Asian. So I can see why some ppl are dismissive.  I honestly don’t blame you for not knowing Korean. It’s kind of taken for granted here that, we are lucky to have many of our own here."
11,kd56wb,I'm surprised how much this happens between other Asians too. I grew up in almost the same situation and the number of FOB Asian people who shunned me for not speaking Chinese was insane.
12,kd56wb,"By OC, do you mean Orange County in California? I'm Vietnamese-American and grew up in California my whole life but I used to not live in OC. When I moved to OC, it felt like I was looked down upon for not being able to speak Vietnamese by those who grew up in Vietnamese-speaking communities like Little Saigon. Although I can kind of understand the language, I can't speak it very well and I've forgotten a lot of words. But speaking to your situation, I've gone to high school (in OC, specifically Irvine) with many American-born Koreans who couldn't speak their parents' language either so you're definitely not alone on that aspect."
13,kd56wb,"I feel a bit sad that we’ve mostly given up the tradition of the Japanese language. Having had my Japanese family move here early 1900’s, and going through internment, i can’t help but feel they felt pressure to assimilate. My great grandparents were the last that were fluent.

Considering how little that’s helped me in being seen as a perpetual foreigner, i feel like maybe we gave up this part of our culture for nothing.

I also believe there’s a unique niche of asian-american culture that is invisible to most. I’m not really asian, and not really american. Just some sort of blend of the two."
14,kd56wb,"Yup I 100% relate. My family is from Singapore and everyone speaks fluent English and Chinese; even my grandparents speak English. So when they moved to the US, it was only natural that English would be the standard spoken language in our home. I also grew up in a predominantly caucasian environment. It wasn't until I went to college in CA and interacting with more asians that I started getting the look of disappointment from older folks.  My chinese got a little better (took some classes in college) but I still feel those judgemental looks."
15,kd56wb,same same
16,kd56wb,"I relate so much to this, except it's not even my parents' language because they were born here too. (I'm fifth generation.) 

Never understood why people blame us for not speaking a language we didn't grow up with and weren't educated in. The gatekeeping and exclusion are really unfair. I strongly identify as Asian and have dealt with racism throughout my life for being Chinese, but other Chinese people don't accept me as Chinese."
17,kd56wb,"I don’t think they’re blaming you, more so they feel like it’s natural for a Korean to speak Korean so they’re confused. They don’t know your background, your history. They just know their own and those of people around them. If all the Koreans they know speak Korean, it’s weird for them if you don’t. End of the day, nothing wrong with it, your parents didn’t teach you it. If the person asking/wondering knew, they wouldn’t ask."
18,kd56wb,My mom keeps complaining I don’t know vietnamese but she hasn’t learned English and lived in america longer than I’ve been alive 🤷‍♂️
19,kd56wb,"From OC back in the day before the 2nd wave of Koreans, part of the first wave. Moved to the US when I was 1 then to OC/SoCal when I was 4. I did not learn Korean except the basics. Wished I learned more but it's ok, I am an American and English is my primary language. It's a power trip and a way to for them to feel superior. Don't worry about them, just smile and tell them your English is great enough for a fantastic job."
20,kd56wb,"Fuck that bullshit gate-keeping. I can understand it if it was a bunch of friends just giving you friendly shit if that's your group dynamic, but I fucking despise people who truly think that someone isn't a ""true"" ethnicity because they're ""lacking"" something.

I only have a passive understanding of Viet. It PAINS me sometimes that I struggle to communicate with some of the older generation, but I've largely made my peace with it. I'm still Viet. I still suffered the same indignities growing up in this country that a lot of other Viets have. I still grew up in the same sorts of households many of our people did. I know my culture. I love my culture. I went to school and studied our history. I love to cook our dishes. I learned to pray in Viet. I support the Viet community. 

But you know what? Even if I didn't, even if did NONE of that, I'd still be Viet. This shit is branded on my skin. Fuck the gate-keeping, I still get called a chink, a gook, whatever. People still talk about dog eating, talk about tiny dicks, talk about broken accents, talk about commies, talk about all this bullshit. No matter how American I am, no matter what my birth certificate says, no matter MY ACCENT, MY CLOTHES, MY JOB, MY EVERYTHING, I can NEVER escape the fact that I DON'T LOOK LIKE THE MAJORITY, THAT I STILL FEEL THE DIFFERENCE, THAT I AM ALWAYS GOING TO BE ON THE OUTSIDE.

Met this person a week ago, talking shit about how I ain't Viet because I can't speak it well. Making fun of me for having a tattoo of Viet Nam. Just being fucking dismissive. Talking mad shit about how I've never been back to the mother country. 

Nah, fuck that, fuck ALL of that. I didn't spend my ENTIRE FUCKING LIFE getting shit on for my skin color, getting jumped, getting belittled by my peers and my fucking family, struggling to stay proud of who I AM in the face of all this constant hate for something I CAN'T CONTROL, just for some random ass person to gate-keep me. 

FUCK EVERYONE who shits on me and my bad Viet, telling me I'm not a ""true"" Viet. I carry being a minority in America on my back, and I carry it with fucking pride. Y'all can't take that away from me. Get the fuck outta here. You know what? Here, I'll play your stupid fucking games. Du ma may. Fuck the accent marks, I'm just done."
21,kd56wb,"It's human nature to find arbitrary ways you are better than someone else? English better than Asian language? Whitewashed. Asian language better than English? FOB. Who has the perfect balance? The person judging.

We do it all the time too in other places. Driver going faster than you? Maniac. Driver going slower? Grandma. Who drives at the perfect speed? Only you do."
22,kd56wb,"They are probably assuming that you are rejecting your heritage, which is a big disappointment to them. They should mind their fucking business lol but ya know, Koreans are nosy af (speaking as one)."
23,kd56wb,"I feel like some Asian countries see the loss of culture from generation to generation as selling-out to the ""enemy"" (as outdated as that concept is). 

I've lived in China for the better part of my life, and I feel like there's this sentiment that when kids go study abroad, they're abandoning their roots and dishonoring their ancestors. I also think (at least in China) there's anti-foreign sentiment because of how we were historically taken advantage of (think spheres of influence), so that's where my point of selling-out comes from. When a Chinese-looking person (especially in the US) doesn't know how to speak Chinese, people think that they're going to the ""enemy's side"" because of how tense the relationship between the US and China is.

But I'm 16, so don't take my word for it."
24,kd56wb,"there's nothing wrong with it, and unfortunately sometimes out of our control. I'm an Asian adoptee so I've never known my native language, which sucks and somehow does make me feel inferior or like, ""less Asian."" imo it's more that there are asians all around the world growing up in different circumstances, cultures, and environments, but that doesn't make them less Asian. I wish people will start to understand this haha"
25,kd56wb,"It's the notion of ""forgetting your roots"". Nothing wrong with you."
26,kd56wb,"I never got this, why didn't the people criticizing you go out of the way teach you some of the language."
27,kd56wb,"The times that I've heard of stuff like this, it's the older generations looking down and trying to find faults with the younger generation. There is absolutely nothing wrong with someone of X ethnicity who doesn't speak their ancestral language, especially when they weren't born in that country or haven't lived in that country in a very long time. 

If someone has a problem with it, sorry not sorry, it's *their* problem to get over."
28,kd56wb,"Nope. I encountered the opposite in fact.

Back in 6th grade, my mom always walk me to school and pick me up right in front of the classroom door everyday, and not only did some of my classmates made fun of me for ""being with my mom"" (people there thought it was embarrassing for a tween to be with their parents in public), but they also made fun of me in class sometimes, because of my mom speaking Mandarin (I always reply in English).   

And this is in California; a state that is like 15% Asian (although I live in a more conservative area that voted for Donald Trump both this year and in 2016)."
29,kd56wb,"yeah, being filipino, I used to be super insecure about not knowing tagalog. growing up, my dad would often bump into so many filipinos from the same province in the philippines where he grew up and would always lament to them that I didn't know how to talk and join in the on the conversation. I remember picking up a ""learn tagalog"" book when I was younger, skimming the pages and being confused because there were words in there that were different from when my parents would talk. I chalked it up to the complexity of the language. 

imagine my surprise years later when I found out he wasn't even talking tagalog, but our regional dialect -ilocano- instead! my dad told me he doesn't really know how to speak tagalog all that well 😄 

so yeah don't sweat it dude"
30,kd56wb,"I feel for you, I relate the same. I'm Indian, and quite shy, grew up with speech difficulties so it was difficult and took immense hard work and effort JUST learning to speak English as my primary language. After that, no matter how much I tried, I couldn't grasp Urdu.

Now, Indian people all around me who don't know I'm directly related to my mother assume I'm just her white/latino friend. Ive been served watered down chutney at my fav deli as a result and it's kind of funny but two years ago, I went to a job interview at a podiatrists office. I took the initial half of the interview with a staff member, all was okay, I went home and waited for the second half. When I finally got to the second half of the interview, the Indian American doctor who owned the private practice interviewed me in her office and asked multiple times about ""where I'm from"" even though I answered multiple times that I was born on Long Island, NY, and she kept probing for which areas of India that my parents specifically came from. I only know the town/village names. She obsessively asked about the geography of where my folks came from. I don't visit my extended family nearly enough to retain that kind of info especially since my folks always made the travel arrangements and stuff (the last time I visited I was in my teens). She also asked about my plans for pregnancy, marraige (????) And then she asked about my capacity for being bilingual. ""The application said that bilingual was preferred, but not a requirement, so I applied anyway"". ""Then why is your last name (my very Indian last name here) if you don't speak hindi or urdu?""

This was an college educated doctorate wielding woman, in America, of the same nationality and race as me, asking me these questions. I'm fucking amazed she didn't just ask some bullshit like what caste or socioeconomic class I was. 

I left that interview feeling Gobsmacked and like shit. I didn't care if I get rejected but I felt worn out and violated."
31,kd56wb," I don't know how old you are, but my experiences are similar, and at some point, I became very comfortable with who I am and just stopped giving a shit about what other people had to say."

33,kd56wb,"I just wanna say I'm totally with you. Growing up as basically the Korean who knew the least Korean, I would be made fun of by my Korean peers and I basically stopped hanging out with Koreans in high school. It wasn't until I met other Koreans that were also specifically like me or didn't really care about having Korean friends that I felt a lot more comfortable with my ""lack of Koreaness,"" even though I know I'm just as Korean as someone who does know the language. Even know I feel a little bad about not knowing Korean, and it's part of my to-do list, although that list hardly ever gets done. Honestly, I think I just want to learn Spanish to get closer to my girlfriend's Hispanic family.

34,kd56wb,"im 17 years old half asian and i live in rural Florida with my white father. my Asian mother left. I've been dealing with the same thing as you just not as hard since I know a bit of Chinese. though I have no idea what my culture is like I'm proud to be Asian as well as American.  there will always people who don't see us as real Americans but our friends and family know that we are, what I've dealt with in the south made me realize that I shouldn't even care what people think.  people who look down on you for not knowing a language because of your race are people who don't matter in the first place. just keep on being you man, the right people will come along and stick with you."
35,kd56wb,"i'm in the same boat in about the same geographical place and you know what? just up your yae/nae game and give zero fucks. 

To be completely honest with you, the OC based Korean-American (boomer age) population is **well short** of ""Moral Authority"" so I just don't give a fuck about what they think."
36,kd56wb,Screw what other people think.  It's time for the ignorant people with these assumptions to learn that we are all different individuals from different backgrounds and not all cut out to be the same.
37,kd56wb,"I grew up in California and moved to the OC from the IE when I was 9, basically went from living in an area that was 90% white to a diverse area where I wasn't the only Asian person in class. I've never had anyone ask me why I don't speak Vietnamese in a condescending tone, tbh. Although I never really interacted with other Vietnamese Americans. My only interaction with other Vietnamese have been those who came to the US from overseas (like one of my former coworkers) and not other American-born Vietnamese."
38,kd56wb,"When I was living in SoCal I used to think all those Chicanos because they had that accent they must speak Spanish. Then my friend who is an actual Mexican who spent some time in LA said that most of them barely speak Spanish, they just sound like that and of course look Mestizo. He doesn't consider them Mexican at all because at the end of the day they were born and raised in the US, barely speaking real Spanish.

I bet those people in the OC when they speak to an actual Korean they sound like an American. They're just using their ability to speak at an above elementary level to make themselves feel superior to others in the community so don't beat yourself up. At the end of the day they are not really considered Koreans by actual Koreans."
39,kd56wb,"As a Filipino-American I've put up with the same shit, even from people who couldn't point out the Philippines on a map.

It all boils down to people wanting to perpetuate this ""comfortable"" image of you as an exotic foreigner among them, and feeling threatened if you don't conform to that.

Only to gaslight you that they're not being racist once you call them out. (Or was that just me?)"
40,kd56wb,"The xenophobia and discrimination is REAL. I moved to the states when I was young, my first speaking language was korean - but because my parents felt me and my sibling would have too hard a time assimilating, they only allowed english at home. And thus the korean was forgotten. I am a product of my environment. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm trying to learn on my own now, but that doesn't give much leeway from ""native koreans"" about my lack of knowledge."
41,kd56wb,"Yea it’s the same for me. My parents are disappointed that I can’t really speak Mandarin. I can understand it, but I can’t speak, read, or write it (only the basics like numbers and simple characters). I started going to a Chinese language school on Saturdays since I was 3, and I’m still going. But going to it doesn’t mean it’ll improve my Chinese. I still suck at it after 10 years. Even my dad (they’re both Taiwanese) says that the Chinese school I go to is kinda useless. Also, they give out ridiculous amounts of homework as well (and tests), so I have to go to 2 schools, one on Saturday, and I get double the work and tests, and the thing I hate about it being on Saturday is that every teacher and student on Friday says “Yay it’s Friday!” when I’m sitting at my desk doing Chinese homework until 2:30am. Sorry about this rant, I just get so frustrated with these things."
42,kd56wb,"Hey there, I was born and raised in OC. First of all I'm sorry you were made to feel that way. My parents are Filipino and never taught me the language either, so I know how it feels to be shamed for something that was never your choice to begin with.

I just wanted to share the reason why you might be getting called out for not speaking Korean specifically is because of the huge Korean population here and in LA. Since there's such a big number of Koreans here, most immigrant children are raised learning the language, since their parents don't have to assimilate to English as much. So when someone here meets you for the first time, they probably assume you're in that boat, and think it must have been your individual choice to not learn or lose your Korean skills.

In no way does that make it okay to shame you for it, I just wanted to give you an explanation as someone from the area why you might experiencing this."
43,kd56wb,"Most people who will look down on someone for not speaking multiple languages are people who don't know how much effort goes into learning a second language, particularly when that language is not spoken around you.

I'm studying Vietnamese.  It takes [over 2000 hours of study](https://effectivelanguagelearning.com/language-guide/language-difficulty/) for a native English speaker to learn Vietnamese.  (The list there says 1100 classroom hours, and the programs described assume roughly the same amount of time studying outside of the classroom.  And that's for experienced language students.)

2000 hours.  If you put an hour every day into that, that's about six years.  Six years of giving up half of your after-work time *every single day* for something with some emotional and cultural benefit but likely zero economic benefit.

It's a huge commitment.

If you grow up speaking two languages, you get to skip doing all of that, so it's very easy to be smug about being bilingual despite not having put in any effort.

If you grew up speaking something else and then learned English, well, congrats, that's a lot of work, but with how easy it is to find very good English resources everywhere, it's not quite the same as learning a language with fewer speakers, so it's still easy to look down on people.

Basically, anyone looking down on you for your language skills almost certainly lacks perspective."
44,kd56wb,"I am not a fan of this sentiment at all.

I can speak my parents language semi fluently and I got gaslighted for it so really turned me off speaking. I will only speak if the person does not know English. I found that I was able to cultivate a good relationship with my grandma despite language barrier. 

One thing I cannot understand is that some multilingual people act like if you cannot speak your heritage tongue, you are cut off from the culture, which I find false. Where I live, there are tons of kids from the immigrant community my parents are from who can't speak their mother tongue but are strongly connected to the culture nonetheless. So its infuriating to see when they get shamed and harassed for not knowing the language, as they are not less x y or z because of this. More than Asians, Hispanics are the worst at this (and deserves a punch in the face for how they treat Hispanics who don't speak it or speak it fluently)."
45,kd56wb,"Im mixed and while I haven't really gotten that, I am just considered not Korean by folks gatekeeping in part because I don't speak the language."
46,kd56wb,"I hate that this is an expectation on us, and when we visit extended family in our parents’ countries, it’s always “Lolol your Urdu/Punjabi/Chinese/Korean/insert language is soooo bad hahahah you have such an American accent” Gee really, I wonder why lol. Well, why do you expect me to speak just as well as a native when 99% of the people around me speak English? Neither here, nor there do we fit in completely, we will always be in limbo. And I hate when I’m home in America and people are like “ooooh say something in your language :)” they will probably ask the same asinine thing to my children, grandchildren, etc. Because it boils down to the fact that we look different, and they are racist. 

In their eyes, how can we possibly be American just like them; no, it can’t be, someone who looks the way we do *has* to be from somewhere else. They can’t accept it when we say “I’m from Chicago.” They’ll ask, “But where are you really from?” Can you not tell from the fact that my accent is American that I grew up here??? No. It’s a deep-seated belief inside of them, shaped over time, that people who are non-white cannot be American. And on the other hand, the ultra woke who look down on us if we don’t show “PAKISTANI PRIDE” at all times, as if I should be running around in traditional outfits and wearing henna all the time to show I’m proud of my culture. Yes, I love my heritage, but I’m also just as American, I don’t fully relate to people in Pakistan, I shouldn’t be shamed for being “so basic and American and not celebrating my culture by not doing xyz.” I can like basic American pop just as much as Punjabi music and shouldn’t be shamed about either.

I wonder how many generations after me will get asked that even though they will be born and raised here in America, just as I was. And to be fair, though it doesn’t happen as often, people of other races born and raised in Asian countries are also not seen as being from there :/ it is just a consequence of immigration."

I always find it amazing how people think the entire Asian population must look like cartoon Oriental stereotypes, when that's so far from reality. If they visit any Asian country or actually interact with Asians in their country, we don't look like that at all.

0,q4bgvl,"I liked Squid Game, didn't use dubs since I know Korean. But Squid Games on Netflix is available with English and Spanish dub, so isn't it possible that a large portion of the American audience watched without subs? Also, there is a difference between watching sub at home, where you can pause and rewatch scenes, and at a theater.

I rarely go to the theaters but, when I do, it is almost always to watch a film that is primarily in English or Korean. Maybe it is just me but, when I am watching a film at a theater, I prefer not having to read subs because I feel like it does slightly take away from the complete visual immersion into the world of the film."
1,q4bgvl,On tik tok a lot of white and black people have been talking about it and they normally watch it with dubs the dubs were pretty trash lol
2,q4bgvl,"Tbh, I watch everything with subtitles. Between my TVs less than optimal speakers and the variance in how entertainment is mixed/mastered, I really can’t pick up what everyone is saying- and I’m someone who needs to know exactly what people say because you can miss important things!

Extra, extra subtitles if it’s British period drama’s (looking at you Downton Abbey). 

Normalize subtitles, y’all!"
3,q4bgvl,"Honestly, I really hate Bong's quote and the narrative that it's subtitles that's keeping people from watching foreign entertainment. It's such a silly factor to focus on and ignores the bigger picture, which is that many audiences avoid watching foreign things not because of subtitles, but because of close-mindedness (and racism).

As u/Soonhun says, the show is available dubbed in English and Spanish. A large portion of people very well may have watched the show this way. A lot of audiences could still hate subtitles.

Then let's look at Netflix's 2nd most watched show until Squid Game came along... Money Heist! Which is in Spanish! That didn't keep the show from becoming a huge hit.

Not to mention, not everyone can read suitably fast enough for subtitles (which idk I would think diaspora kids would understand, seeing our grandparents struggle at English, etc...) and could have poor eyesight. I hate how ""get over subtitles!"" has become the rallying cry for people to watch more Asian media, it should just be ""watch Asian media"". And honestly, people should advocate for more dubbing to make these contents accessible to more people."
4,q4bgvl,Again proving sub > dub

> ""The cover art for “Know My Name” is inspired by the Japanese art of kintsugi or “golden repair,” in which broken pottery pieces are mended using lacquer and powdered gold. It’s a process that makes a new, beautiful object out of what’s been broken, emphasizing where it has cracked. The association is meant to represent Ms. Miller’s recovery, from the assault as well as the trauma of a trial, Ms. Schulz said."

1,n0dzi0,"The phrasing of the article's title makes it seem like the money they raised was used to ""raise awareness"", which is a term that gets thrown around a lot when discussing sensitive topics like racial injustice.

I had to scroll halfway through the article to see what the chefs were actually raising money for, which included:

* Providing 2,500 meals for Asian elders and Black & Latino homeless shelters facing food insecurity
* Heart of Dinner, which provides meals and produce for elderly Asian Americans
* Welcome to Chinatown, which provides financial relief to small businesses in Chinatown to cover overhead costs
* Apex for Youth, which provides academic mentorship to underserved Asian and immigrant youth in NYC

I think we need to center our discussions around how we're addressing the actual material needs of the Asian American community, especially those who are most vulnerable.

While he was at Manzanar camp, he drew sketches of camp life. Two of the internees who taught him illustration were art directors who were already established in the Californian graphic design and illustration business.

Once the war ended, not having a formal portfolio of his work, Iwao created a sketchbook and used this to apply to work at the Disney studios.

After working on One Hundred and One Dalmations (1961), he made the move into television. It was in 1963 at Hanna-Barbera that he met Barbara Farber. She was the assistant to the public relations director. Part of her job was studio tours, that was how she met Takamoto. They married in 1964 and remained married for 44 years, until his death in 2007.

Apparently there were two other attacks on asians within that week at this university. 

If it is confirmed, I wonder when they will start calling these hate crimes for what they are instead of “isolated, random incidents”."
2,vfahmw,">	They are just those who have lost their basic rationalities and common sense under certain ideologies/hatred/cultures. The limited resources in society/education almost decided that it’s impossible to raise everybody into a decent person with common sense,” the victim said. “Tonight it's my turn, and I'm glad it's my turn and not the turn of anyone else’s, at least I could still take a few punches.”

3,vfahmw,"I hate this violence.  It is so hard for me to wrap my head around.  I can understand muggings where hoodlums are after money.  I don't support it, but I understand it.

These crimes are just a version of the ""Knockout game.""   But what is interesting is these attacks are usually treated like barroom brawls, because it is hard to prove the intent required to raise the punishment.

The [Madison PD's Incident Report](https://www.cityofmadison.com/police/newsroom/incidentreports/incident.cfm?id=29919) among a lot of other information it claims, ""Detectives have no information that leads them to believe this attack is racially motivated at this time.""  That means these guys - if caught and convicted - will be treated like they were in a barroom brawl or something else approaching a fair fight.  

Hmmm... well I can absolutely guarantee that these guys rolled that PhD student because they thought he was an easy target.  Is that racial?  I would argue it is worth considering.  Why shouldn't smaller people deserve protection from being beaten by bigger people.

Maybe that would be an approach to raise the punishment bar on these crimes?  It might actually be something that Dems and the GOP could both support.  Most states already protect the elderly.  Why not give smaller people extra protection or maybe outnumbered people?

Just a thought."
4,vfahmw,"Hey all, I’m an Asian-American student at UW-Madison and I’m extremely disappointed in how the university and campus police are handling this assault. We got no campus safety alert about the incident and were told there’s no evidence that it was a hate crime. This incident happened right down the street from my job and luckily I was on vacation, but for all I know, it could have been me or any one of my other friends in the AAPI community on our campus. I hope the men are caught and face the proper consequences but I also don’t have much hope."

I hope she can continue to heal physically and mentally from this. I take the bus very often in my city and I imagine it would be very challenging to feel safe there again.

Common advice I've seen recently is that Asians who are racially abused and assaulted need to fight back. I agree that we should not take racism lying down and should challenge those who say racist things to us and act in self-defense when we're able, but I think this case exemplifies the really sad reality that these racist abusers are not looking for a ""fair fight"" and they attack those who they perceive as least able to defend themselves.

This attack was perpetrated by three teenage girls and an adult woman using an umbrella as a weapon to attack a 51-year-old woman on a bus. (So 4 against 1.) Russell Jeung at San Francisco State University researches hate crimes against Asians and has found that women are up to three times more likely to be victims of these crimes. Many of these cases in the press and on social media involve men attacking Asian women who are on their own or multiple women attacking an Asian woman, as in this case. (Of course men are attacked too, but as some have pointed out many of these men have successfully fought back.) These racists purposely choose those with less power than them to hurt - women, the elderly, those who don't speak English fluently, etc.

I'm strong and in good shape, but I could easily be injured and killed by pretty much any guy on the street. Yes, I carry pepper spray, but the time a 250-lb looking guy said a slur to me in the parking lot and was looking for a fight, I just gtfo and did not try to engage him or risk taking a photo. I'm not saying women should just resign themselves to being ""passive"" all the time, but racists  seek out those who are physically weaker
than them and are often also misogynists. Notice how when the victim is a woman it's always ""bitch/c*nt"" along with whatever racism they're spewing.

Alongside those who are able to fight/CC/taser/etc. we also need to make sure that Asian hate crime victims are taken seriously by law enforcement after the crime and can pursue recourse through the criminal justice system and civil processes, and many orgs and legal coalitions have been stepping up to help with this.

tl;dr - racists pick on those with less power than them (like this case) so fighting back isn't always viable, which is why we also need to focus on the justice system"

An Orientalist loves his “Oriental” country, and when he encounters an “Oriental” American, he will sniff and say, “You’ve lost your roots” (Frank calls it my “heritage”). **But as Said points out, the Orientalist, while knowing a great number of details about the Oriental country in question, uses that knowledge to perpetuate his own power and superiority, and to create stereotypes about the “Oriental” people which serve to accentuate his own superiority.** Stereotypes like how knowing an “Oriental” woman means knowing an “Oriental” country.

Until maybe mid-freshman year of college, I had this mindset that white conservatives were constantly out to get us, and that any slight towards me from one of them was out of racism. Now not so much anymore, but the fact that Asians are so acceptable to shit on still gets me pissed.

Never really experienced the first three (though I've definitely seen my share of white dudes with yellow fever), but as a dog lover, #4 makes me pissed. I've never thought of eating dog meat, but it's a shame that this is what people think of us. I've even come across a post in /r/aww with a dog in a pot full of water. Mods had to come in and shut down racist posts, and some jackoff on his/her high horse writes an entire paragraph about why ""the entire Asian race should feel collectively embarrassed about dog-eating because that's the only way to truly stop it"" or something along those lines, because apparently shaming an entire race for the actions of a small fraction is the only way to make some Westerners feel comfortable. And they call us sensitive.

Another one that's always gotten me is when non-Asians *butcher* any language that isn't English, but then laugh their asses off at an Asian person *slightly* getting English grammar wrong, and act like a deficiency in any language that doesn't sound like ""ching chang ping pong"" comes with being Asian. I've seen this shit myself, *especially* in high school.

Yeah mine escalated into a rant too, and I have nothing against white people in general (I'd be no better if I did), but I just woke up and this post would have spoken to my 12-to-17-year-old self."
8,aapatk,"A couple things. 
First, the reason it's so common is that Asians don't make a big deal about it. We can't be easy victims. Our African American brothers/sisters are organized and will call shit out. They will rally and boycott and never forget. We have to do the same. Make people being racist towards us know there are consequences. 
Next, we also have to work as a community to educate each other that racism is wrong. You always hear how it's older Asians that are racist but the truth is, the younger generation is just as bad. I've seen so many cases where an affluent Asian kid gets in with the affluent white kids and forgets that they're a minority too. We have to call out each other on our shit. When an Asian sister says they don't date Asians because they're effeminate call them out on that shit. When an Asian brother makes fun of the new Asians because they're FOBs, make it clear that shit doesn't fly.
Lastly we have to stop the Inter-Asian racism. I'm fucking tired of the whole Jungle Asian/Fancy Asian bullshit. That shit hurts more than the people outside being racist to us. If you hate other Asians because of status, know even a little bit of history in the area and find there have been points where we all have struggled and those that are still struggling should be helped. If you hate other Asians because of appearance, dont be a shallow cunt, there is beauty everywhere. And please dont bring the prejudices of the old country here, they're stuck in a bubble, you aren't. Love each other and love your Asianess. "
9,aapatk,"My issue with racism is against Asian men in Hollywood and other American media on-screen. We don't get roles meant for us, or that we could really fill and then it gets passed onto a Caucasian person. 

&#x200B;

Good or bad movie, our roles tend to get whitewashed. Dragon Ball 2009 had a White Goku, but they made Chi Chi's actress Asian (Goku's love interest) and included other Asian actors like Chow Yun-Fat. This movie is universally known to be so crappy, but it's a common proof of Hollywood's mentality where they'll put Asians, but just make the main character White just because.

&#x200B;

Secondly, whenever there's an Asian woman on screen, she's almost always the love interest of the main Caucasian person. The Last Samurai, or The Wolverine (2013), etc. TV shows especially, Iron Fist with Colleen and Agents of Shield with May/Daisy. In Disney's live action remake of Mulan, the original script was to erase the Asian love interest (the general) and replace him with a White man who'd come to save the day. 

&#x200B;

It happens way too often and this is what just makes me mad. Black Panther did very well with all sorts of audiences even though the cast was almost all Black. People all love(d) Jet Li and Jackie Chan, but those guys are getting old and are more or less done busting out action movies left and right. It's like Hollywood is soooo scared to see an Asian man be the lead actor in a film for once, when Asian culture and characters are actually really popular even in the West."
10,aapatk,"Oh yeah. I got banned from r/CHIBears for calling out a racist meme (It was referencing the Japanese episode of South Park) and somehow everyone took more offense over me calling white people ""mayo people"" over the blatantly racist meme."
11,aapatk,"Even in a post about atrocities against Asians, white people still need to be racist, or maybe Asian bootlickers, its hard to tell at this point. Goes to show that dehumanization of Asian people runs very deep in these people's hearts. The fact that people are always using garbage pseudoscience and humor as a disguise for their filthy racism is annoying as hell.

15,aapatk,I think it’s especially annoying because other minority groups don’t go to bat for us. It’s justified because somehow Asians are the least oppressed minority and are practically white in terms of societal privilege. We’re the most “anti-black” minority because of K-Pop.

Or most of the times, they never even knew the existence of such experiences. Really honestly, I get this reactions too often from ppl who live in some of the most diverse places in the U.S AND ppl who are from relatively young generations (the millennias). I get that it may not be the best (or fair) to expect others to know it all from the beginning without giving them the chance to learn. But i would say it is not very great  to be compared someone's experiences and the weight it carried to others' as a way to be dismiss the entire experience which may even shape that person significantly!!.... Worse, it can also provoke a push back towards others' experiences as a result of being compared and dismissed as such(we wouldn't want that,would we?)!"

1,lmf5lw,"> *If the message started from the top, it only makes sense that a strong response comes back from the top.*

I share your pain, pal, but I can't agree with this kind of response. If you're asking for some big leader to rebuke racism, then this kind of appeal to authority will prove to be a temporary fix at best, and the sale of our freedom at worst. Those in power, whether it be police or a president, has never had our best interests in mind - only their own best interests, and their own best interests will always be to remain in power. When the factors for remaining in power are protecting the innocent and the marginalized, that's wonderful. When the factors become racism and xenophobia towards the marginalized, then what can stop those with power, those with a monopoly on state-sanctioned violence? It's a double edged sword.

In my opinion, only by uniting on the ground can we hope to fight against the powers that be adn the racism against us while still keeping our integrity and independence. Only those of us in the Asian American community know what the Asian American community needs, and right now that is safety and security. I believe we can keep ourselves safe while not trading in our independence or being subservient to some leader, and that's what's been happening right now - the Compassion in Oakland initiative has been escorting Asian elders, and they haven't had to ask the police or any other authorities for help."
2,lmf5lw,">the fact is that this culture of xenophobia can be sourced back to one seed: the one planted by the Trump administration when it kept tying COVID to China.

I am not sure this is true. There may have been many xenophobic verbal abuses during his admin, but not the level of violent attacks we are seeing now. Also, you can't ignore most of the perpetrators (largely African American) seen in the recent violent videos and news reports do not statistically correlate with support for Trump. 

It appears more of an ""easy, defenseless"" target situation for people looking to commit crime in general as a result of poor economic prospects."

Witnesses in Detroit, including the police, saw the events unfold first-hand, and despite pleading guilty, these murderers were not given jail time but instead a $3,000 fine because the judge felt ""These weren't the kind of men you send to jail... You don't make the punishment fit the crime; you make the punishment fit the criminal.""

I believe that Ebens and Nitz are still trying to have liens on their properties, from civil suits, vacated. Fuck 'em. Given that they haven't been punished with any prison time, they deserve to be driven into homelessness and destitution, subsequently being subject to predation on the streets; that should be the least of their punishment."

I hate that ""Asians"" are all lumped together in data like this. I understand the historical underpinnings and current power of ""Asian American"" as a political organizing/ voting block and why this makes sense for lazy or under-resourced researchers, but aggregation of ""Asians"" as a racial category completely erases the disparities that exist within that category. Country of ethnic origin and immigration/ generation status make a lot of difference within the ""Asian"" category - for example, when we look at income by  country of ethnic origin, the disparities are wide: [https://equitablegrowth.org/how-data-disaggregation-matters-for-asian-americans-and-pacific-islanders/](https://equitablegrowth.org/how-data-disaggregation-matters-for-asian-americans-and-pacific-islanders/).

But I hate how there’s inflammatory rhetoric being built about how we’re almost white. Even educated Asians struggle to move up in the workplace while less experienced less educated white coworkers move up the ladder (has sort of happened at my dad’s workplace, although he is also super thankful for having an education in the first place and a pretty stable job).

Jennifer Pan, co-author of the paper and assistant professor of Communications at Stanford University, says there is a general belief that Chinese students overseas are indoctrinated to wholeheartedly support the Chinese Communist Party.

The research found that college freshmen from China who read derogatory comments against Chinese people are more likely to support Beijing, while general criticism against the government's coronavirus handling did not produce the same effects.

Prof Pan says the findings suggest that Chinese students in the US, whose survey responses are ""mature, sophisticated and thoughtful for their age"", can rationally process criticism against China."
1,i3jcjj,"I'm Chinese Canadian and never particularly identified as Chinese until I went to the US for a graduate degree, and then the chauvanism / American exceptionalism honestly made me more sympathetic towards Chinese people.

2,i3jcjj,"Not surprising that racism and mistreatment made them feel closer to China. I little over a decade ago I went to grad school for a Masters in International Relations after receiving my political science BA. The program had about 40-50 people, and we had several Chinese students.

Class sizes were small so discussions were pretty common. The amount of shit people gave the Chinese students about China and its government was nuts. Questions like ""Why does China hate freedom?, ""Why does China kill and eat so many dogs?"" or ""Why does China oppress these people?"" were directed at these Chinese students, like somehow they were supposed to answer for a billion people and a government they have no say in. It wasn't an exchange of ideas; non-Chinese students wanted these Chinese students to give some kind of public mea culpa of how deficient their country was. As far as the non-Chinese students were concerned, they had all the answers and already ""won"", it was just a matter of forcing the Chinese students to realize it and make them admit ""China bad, America good"".

As a Chinese American, I was able to make friends with a couple of them, and got to know how they felt about studying in America (I studied abroad for 2.5 years in Japan and Korea, so I have an interest in foreign exchange student experiences). While they took the attacks and racism in stride, they weren't particularly okay with it. They felt like they HAD to defend China because they weren't given the intellectual breathing room, the benefit of a doubt, to even have a nuanced discussion."
3,i3jcjj,">The strained bilateral relations have swayed public opinion, as a recent survey found that 73% of American adults have an unfavourable view of China - an historic high.

What a nightmare. I've heard politicians of both parties bashing China. It's definitely mainstream political thought now to at least dogwhistle to haters. Heard it here in a local town hall on environmental issues. Our local liberal democratic congressman was being pressed on his weak stance on the environment and he blamed China instead of actually taking responsibility. That Biden ad trying to tie Trump to China was really really scary. These politicians don't give a fuck about Chinese people at all and are perfectly happy throwing us under the bus to get a few racist votes."
4,i3jcjj,"The longer this McCarthyism bs goes on the more dramatic the brain drain from US institutions is gonna be. I feel like more students in Asia are realizing that life in America really isn't sunshine and rainbows or the only way to get a fulfilling career with high status. Combined with all the rhetoric in China against chinese people studying abroad, future students might just decide to stay home. When so many asians, especially internationals, do the hard, unrecognized work for our research, our elite institutions are fucked if these people decide to go elsewhere."
5,i3jcjj,"Keep on being racist USA, I wasn't even born in China and I still hate US government/culture for what they have done on degrading Asians.

The people in this subreddit saying 'Well im not Chinese', really think racist western society will you see you any different is hilarious."
6,i3jcjj,"Man, that sentence basically explains my experience as a Taiwanese/Chinese American ahhaha."
7,i3jcjj,"The general populism-based hate is nothing new. When the Irish were moving over, the hate was engineered against the Irish. And then Italians took the beat. Later on it was pan-Asians, specifically Chinese people. There you have Angel Island, Asian & Chinese Exclusion Acts. And then Japanese were the target. Our leaders are walking a very fine & risky path. They are throwing Americans of Chinese and even Asian descent under the bus for political gains.

People like to blame Chinese students for sticking with each other just as they like to blame immigrants for not ""assimilating."" In the meantime, they actively ostracize & reject those people."
8,i3jcjj,"Hmmm. The narrative here is pretty reflective of my personal experiences. I have a lot of *Chinese [edit] colleagues who came to the US for their PhDs or postdoctoral work. With the pandemic and the shitty behavior of the Trump administration, their perception of the US has really been challenged - they never really understood what the US fundamentally is: a flawed country but one with the capacity to change due to it's democratic nature. 

It's imperative that they come to realize the last part, that this country has the capacity for change. Otherwise we end up with situations like that of Shizeng Tie in the article, who is so disillusioned with America and no longer can imagine a permanent life here and wants to return to China. She never figured out what the democratic ideals of the US meant, despite being in the US since she was 13. Frustratingly, this is illustrated by her penning ""...an online petition, protesting against her university hosting a panel with Hong Kong democracy activists."" 

On the other hand, the article describes Iris Li, ""...feeling ""very uncomfortable"" when she first arrived in America six years ago and saw her fellow students waving Taiwanese flags, which are seen in mainland China as a symbol for Taiwan independence.

But after getting to know the Taiwanese students, she realised that though their views may have been completely different, they could discuss issues respectfully, which is encouraged in American classrooms."" As a result, ""The sociology and religious studies student thinks the pandemic has laid bare the advantages and weaknesses of both political systems. While the Chinese government seems to act more effectively, the US allows dissent, and at times, it is able to correct its own mistakes."""
9,i3jcjj,"The PRC has always has been like that.  You're Chinese when they need, or want, something from you.  But you're ""descendants of Mongolians"" when they don't need you, or when you need help from them. 


Similarly for the US.  Even if your ancestors have been in the US for generations, you will still occasionally get treated as a recent immigrant/foreigner because you ""look foreign""."
10,i3jcjj,That's 'cause both leaders are shitheads. Trump and Xi can both suck a fat one.
11,i3jcjj,"Fuck Chinas stupid government. 

It’s hella ironic that there are so many kids of Chinese descent sticking up for China when your parents most likely escaped China to get away from that tyrannical hell hole. 

Be proud to be Chinese, but seriously, get a grip, that place is fucked until they remove that government and allow its citizens some autonomy and creative freedom.

Your government has FAILED you and will continue to bring you adversity and pain as it acts obnoxiously on the world stage. 

The people of China deserve an infinite times more than what they’ve been brain washed in to believing. Be the better version of China."
12,i3jcjj,"Wow. The number of people down voting my comment because I believe in individual ethnic identity within Asian communities is astonishing. 

Congratulations on reinforcing generalisations and stereotypes. You should just rename this group ‘Chinese Americans’

This group has officially lost my support."

2,7a7qpa,“Cricket fields!” Lol if you’re upset about cricket you should be blaming your ancestors for exporting shitty white sports with colonialism.
3,7a7qpa,"Let's be honest here. To a lot of white people, we're just like Tabasco sauce: We're ""acceptable"" in smaller amounts, but when there's just ""a little too much,"" they start shitting themselves.

But the truth of the matter is ""too Asianized"" schools don't fail. Not even close, quite the contrary really: They actually succeed well.

One of my ex-gfs was originally from the Sugar Land-Missouri City area of Houston, more specifically the part that was majority Asian. She was actually in the minority at her high school (she was white and her high school was majority Asian). And she said the school attracted a lot of teachers who could actually teach their classes and not have to worry about discipline issues. On top of that, the neighborhood brought in a lot of wealthy homeowners that made the area a prime spot for realtors. And she could assure you that cricket fields DID NOT go up and replace the baseball fields.

Sure, a lot of the white people in her neighborhood were sometimes pretty ignorant. Sometimes, they were pretty racist (Her mom said she liked me because Koreans were ""the clean Asian ethnicity""). But overall, they kept to themselves and they had no qualms about their kids hanging out with mostly Asian kids or taking an Asian boy or girl to the prom. And to say that Asians ""bring down"" a neighborhood couldn't be anymore wrong.

Did I mention that this ex-gf was from a neighborhood IN TEXAS?"

Edit:

After considering this a little bit more, this flyer seems kind of suspicious. There are a few issues to consider:

Who is this targeting? Who are the candidates at stake in this election? Following the overall demographics of the town, there are accordingly multiple tickets featuring Indian/Asian American candidates. Why target these two specifically? I can see a few possibilities for this: 

1) is that the flyer wants voters to vote for an anonymous perpetrator, who is presumably a (white) candidate playing on nativist sentiment in a population that is rapidly declining in demographic prominence. 

2) is that the flyer is playing the candidates portrayed as victims to stir up sympathy votes in their favor in a twisted, backwards kind of logic. 

3) is that the flyer is written by a third candidate (presumably also an Asian ticket) who is attempting, by some next level reverse psychology, to drum up urgency amongst Asian American voters to combat nativist sentiment while also discrediting the two candidates portrayed as perpetrators of reason (2). 

Whatever it is, all the possibilities are extremely despicable and petty. While I can only hope that it wasn’t (2) or (3) (and (1) as well while we’re at it), reality dictates that one of them must be the case. Regardless, complete shame on whoever did it. 

Anti-Asian anxiety is unfortunately not new in this town despite the fact that Asians most likely form a plurality  of Edison’s population at this point. Jun Choi (first Asian American mayor in Edison) weathered racist criticism from 101.5 radio hosts [Carton and Rossi](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2007/03/23/nyregion/23jersey.html) ([Carton is incidentally currently being investigated for running a Ponzi scheme](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/nyregion/craig-carton-sports-radio-host-is-accused-in-ponzi-scheme.html)), and of course you also have my high school alum [Joel Stein’s infamous Time magazine column](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1999416,00.html) spewing some casual bullshit about ‘dotheads’ in the 80s and 90s.

I think we also have to talk about the intersection of comedy and societal views on marginalized groups. It's often said in comedy circles that no topic is off-limits, and no group should be protected, from jokes because ""it's just a joke"". I think this is a cop out and a lazy pass for comedians to make low-effort comedy by utilizing shock-value rather than making a joke both funny AND poignant. Jokes are not ""just jokes"" as it enforces societal views on what is normal and OK to laugh at and take less seriously."

Coming to term with past misdeeds is hard, especially when forced to do so publicly, but it's clear the right move would be to get therapy, work through your hangups and what caused you to engage in these acts, and maybe try to have a public conversation about your path to redemption.

It's sad to see that he's lashing out. I know it's coming from a place of insecurity, and a strange attempt to 'get back' at the PC crowd for 'ruining his career' (imo he ruined his career by doing what he did, but I can understand him feeling that way considering the cognitive dissonance he's under). Still, it's hard not to take his comments to heart. They sting. They echo a fear of what white people actually think and say behind closed doors.

Still, I don't believe this is actually him. I think he's lost, scared, and acting out of fear/anger/insecurity. I hope someone close to him can talk to him and get him some help. He doesn't deserve to be an outcast for the rest of his life, but he's got a hell of a lot to work to do before winning back public trust."

3,nn7m06,Oh I'm definitely mentally preparing myself.
4,nn7m06,"Yes and no. The lab leak theory itself is fine. Some researchers fucked up and the virus came out, no different from the wet market theory. The problem is that they use the lab theory to ascribe malice towards the Chinese government, that the Chinese government purposefully let the virus out. This, of course, will turn into calls for punitive measures against the Chinese government, and spill out against asian americans. I think the intentions and connotations that certain people are trying to pull from it, which is the further demonization of the Chinese people as a barbaric, brainwashed race threatening America, that will cause spillover violence against Asian Americans and Chinese people in particular regardless of their background."

6,nn7m06,"Yes. They have no new evidence but they’re already spinning it like there is. Even if they don’t find anything, they’ll just say “The Chinese are not being transparent and the WHO is in their pockets.”

Edit: Here is a Twitter thread that puts thing into perspective: [https://twitter.com/beijingpalmer/status/1397920325128515592?s=21](https://twitter.com/beijingpalmer/status/1397920325128515592?s=21)

Basically, I feel like the US really wants to find something so that they can either start a war with China, put sanctions on them or force them to pay a huge fine (that would cripple the Chinese economy) to compensate for economic losses suffered by US companies. Asian-Americans will become collateral damage.

EDIT #2: Look at the type of stuff [tweeted](https://twitter.com/davidfrum/status/1398268985326645248) by people like David Frum (former speechwriter for George W. Bush, current contributor to The Atlantic magazine):

>BTW even if the lab-leak story is false, China's not off hook. It's not much of a comfort that millions lost their lives - hundreds of millions were locked down - not because of a medical accident, but instead because of disgusting practices in Chinese food markets."
7,nn7m06,"This is just like the phantom ""mass weapon"" of Iraq. One can simply never prove that something does NOT exist, so they can forever use that excuse to attack anyone they want. And it is a dangerous game. Technically, it doesn't make much difference for our knowledge about the zoonotic virus whether or not the virus at some point infected some lab workers. I am an epidemiologist, and this type of zoonotic spillover happens all the time wherever people touch animals (including corpses, feces, saliva, etc). Nobody gave a shit when Ebola killed tens of thousands of Afiricans because the develped world was not bothered. Any difference this time? Some people believe their freedom is more valuable than other people's lives, and they have louder voice than the others."
8,nn7m06,"Please correct me if I'm wrong with this sentiment, but it just shows how unity is so difficult. Folks of Korean or japanese descent say ""don't blame me, I'm not Chinese"" and other variations, with therefore the Asian community as a whole fracturing and stigmatizing one another. Would love to see a more positive light, but the above line has been said so many times"
9,nn7m06,"It's the weirdest shit: the same right-winged, white supremacist blowhards will insist COVID is either no big deal, or even a hoax, and will refuse to wear a mask or get vaccinated but then will also simultaneously blame China for it 🙄"
10,nn7m06,They’re engineering consent to go to war. How the hell did we not see this coming.
11,nn7m06,"Yeah, I do. It’s fine to hate on the Chinese government. It’s wrong to hate everyone who “looks Chinese.”"
12,nn7m06,"The white supremacists have never needed a reason to hate us. If this virus was bioengineered and was leaked from a lab, I'm worried that the white supremacists will attract more followers.

Look at what happened in New York City after Hamas shot rockets into Israel and the Israelis responded with air strikes. American Jews were set upon by Palestinian sympathizers even though these Americans had nothing to do with the Israeli airstrikes."
13,nn7m06,"I think the Wuhan leak is news worthy but not sustainable as the virus count goes down. The prolonged issue is going to be the economic and technological territorialism about to erupt full scale on the shopping public.

14,nn7m06,"I might be in the minority but better for a conclusive result to surface proving the accidental lab leak theory and brace for the expected violence which will be intense but short-term as there will be an equally pervasive social pushback than a lengthened period of distrust which would forever plague the Asian community for as long as there isn't a conclusive answer. It doesn't really matter if the lab theory gets disproven behind a doubt, the amount of people who won't trust the Communist Party of China is already super high and won't change their opinions anytime soon."

16,nn7m06,"There was an article in Nature (!) arguing that the lab leak theory shouldn't be entertained because it could fuel racism. I find that crazy. We can't hand over, quite literally, the future of humanity because we are are worried about the misunderstandings of a few violent idiots.

Another problem is that we don't know what happened in Wuhan or how the coronavirus (which killed 3.5 million people) came to be. We need a full investigation and rigorous root cause analysis. The possibility that people or institutions may be embarrassed is irrelevant. There are plenty of people and institutions that may have had a finger in this pie. The Trump Administration, The Obama Administration, the CDC, the WHO, the Wuhan Virology Lab, Tony Fauci, Peter Daszak, the CCP, the Wet Market. The truth is what matters. Let's get to it."

I want you all to know that many of us support you all. I have many Asian friends and have sent them lots of love recently, to tell them they are appreciated and that Asian racism isn't and shouldn't be tolerated. I know what it feels like to have your concerns and feelings taken as if they don't matter and I'll be damned if it happens to one of my friends. Keep up the good fight. I really wish I could make a thread but I understand this isn't my place and I'm here as a guest.

edit: seems I can make a thread!"
1,m16l2j,"When all of this name calling and attacks on Asian Americans ramped up during the pandemic I told my dad to be extra careful. He didn’t outright laugh, but was basically like, “so how is this different than life as normal?” Growing up was basically taught to be more polite, always respond with a smile, and try to diffuse the situation."
2,m16l2j,">Over time, you shrink the parts of self that feel other. I got so good at minimizing my Asian side that when classmates switched from calling me ""Ping-Pong Pang"" to ""Twinkie"" — yellow on the outside, White on the inside — I felt relief, and that I would make it, after all. I was now named after a high-calorie snack cake — what was more American than that?
It was convenient to dismiss racial slights, to keep my head down and not ruffle feathers if it meant I could ignore what was happening. But recently I felt something inside of me clawing to get out and get loud. Last spring, in the safety of our bubbles, my Asian friends and I started to ask questions: Why is Covid-19 being called the ""China virus"" and the ""kung flu""? What is going on with the uptick of blatant racism being hurled at our communities? Why have our parents become so afraid of strangers' accusatory glances that they've stopped going to their local gym and grocery store?  

Wait this is how people were raised? My parents taught me to fight back. I remember being in kindergarten or first grade, my parents were very ""eye for an eye"" in regard to any bullying or hostility to me"
3,m16l2j,"I hate feeling like a 2nd class citizen in this country.  A few months ago, while having prostate issues, I was at the medical clinic for a local urologist to see the doctor for the first time. 

The office manager was a blue haired older white woman.

She called me over to the reception desk to tell me that there was a problem with my name. My first name is Christian (because I'm Christian and was so baptized as a child). My family name is Chinese because that's what my ethnicity is.

The woman claimed that my name couldn't possibly be \_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_ because my first name was an ""American"" name.

I told the woman that I'm a 3rd generation U.S. citizen.

""That doesn't matter,"" complained the office manager. ""You're Asian and you're supposed to have an Asian name. White people have white people names. Asians have Asian names.""

I stared at the woman in disbelief. Was she SERIOUSLY making my name an issue?

""I can't imagine what your parents were thinking,"" she sniffed. ""They must have been horribly ignorant people.""

I left the office without bothering to tell her that my father is a retired doctor and my mother is a retired English lit professor. 

I subsequently wrote a letter of complaint to the doctor and hand delivered it to the office. The manager promptly opened the letter even though it hadn't been addressed to her. I know she read the letter because she called to leave me an angry voice mail about how she had NOTHING to apologize for. She claimed that she had the right to believe that white people ought to have white names while Asians should have Asian names. She said that the only real racist was ME. She then blessed me in a tone that was clearly not meant to be a blessing. 

I filed a complaint with the state attorney general's office on Civil Rights and alleged that my rights had been violated. When a clerk called to ask me how my rights had been violated, I pointed out that the urologist was local and I had waited two weeks to see him. I would now have to see a urologist in a city that was a three hour roundtrip drive away and I'd have to wait for another two weeks for my first appointment. 

My complaint against the office manager is now being investigated.

I also did an end run around the office manager. I googled the doctor, found his home address, and wrote to him about what had happened at his home address. He wrote back to tell me how appalled he was and promised to address this situation. He did not explain what he meant by this. Although he invited me back for treatment, I refused to go because I didn't want to have to interact with his racist office manager."

>What makes the situation even worse, the attacked player’s parents said, is that the players behind the physical altercation were only reprimanded after frustrated parents demanded something be done.

>The physical confrontation, which was caught on camera and obtained by KPIX, shows Lennie and Eduardo’s son, Evan (last names were not given for fear of retaliation) at an AAU tournament game at the Soldiertown gym in Oakland.  
>  
>In the video, Evan is seen trying to grab a loose ball before an opposing player reaches it. That player passes the ball to a teammate and then is seen pushing Evan. Evan gets up and is then pushed to the ground by a second opposing player standing nearby.  
>  
>Words are exchanged before Evan walks away and returns to the player, who then punches Evan in the head.

>“Not one single parent stood up to go protect my son, I ran across the gym to get him,” Lennie said.

They accepted money to game the system for their own benefit so they were complicit and a big fat fucking hypocrite. The double standards have been around for ages. Just look up the Bret Harte poem ""The Heathen Chinese"" written in the late 1800s. It was meant to challenge the anti-Chinese sentiment, but surprise surprise to the readers it only reinforced their prejudice.

1. American media frequently criticize the treatment of migrants, including the caging of children. The issue received *massive* media attention. So I wonder whether the disparity of media treatment you're alleging actually exists in this case.

2. On what metric are you basing the magnitude comparison? If the UN reports are correct, the Uyghurs being held number about a million, they are held longer, the camps appear to involve brainwashing, and PRC domestic media are virtually silent about them (except absurd lies like the ""vocational training camps"" nonsense). (Of course the Uyghur situation goes beyond just the camps, but then the migrant situation goes beyond kids in cages too.)

Asians generally aren't making racist comments on Reddit about Asians so why should we expect White people do it? That being said, people are making still making generalized comments with the same intent but its of a different flavor. "
21,b0svrz,"Whites are \*individuals\* Not like us \*Asians\*

&#x200B;

God, could you imagine? "
22,b0svrz,"I remember from a sociology class, a reason why stereotypes/world views are kept is that when something goes south and challenges a world view, one could treat that as a sub-group/exception to the rule. So these white people who cheated are the few bad apples given how whiteness is ""awesome,"" and "" progressive"" while Asians who do good are also treated as exceptions, the silver lining of an otherwise ""bad"" group of people. It's actually rather interesting having studied why stereotypes exist from both sociology and psychology."
23,b0svrz,"I can't speak for anyone else, but most of the posts I've seen about this have the comments roasting the cheaters for exemplifying rich/white privilege."
24,b0svrz,Why would you want something to happen to others that you obviously don’t like? Racism sucks regardless of race. 
25,b0svrz,"This isn't really a race thing though, its more of a super rich people are able to cheat thing. The vast majority of white people are incapable of pulling that shit so for it to be caught and brought out into the open on this big of a scale is a big deal. As for your question I've seen quite a few people hating on said mega rich alumni and the big ivy league colleges due to this incident."
26,b0svrz,Do you realize how whiny this post makes you sound?
27,b0svrz,"I'm all for calling out double standards in society, and having a thoughtful discussion on issues, but a couple points of information that you ought to correct in your post:

1) Not the biggest cheating ring in US (academic, presumably) history.  That would be this [one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Harvard_cheating_scandal).

2) Not all the [participants](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/investigations-college-admissions-and-testing-bribery-scheme) were white.

If we're going to have a serious discussion, let's start by getting our facts right."
0,spc2o1,"It's ok to be curious about ethnicity, but it's not ok to assume people are not American or less American just because they have Asian faces."
1,spc2o1,"I don't mind being asked about my background, in fact I think it's cool to educate some people about who my people are. I just wish they would word it better or correctly. So more ""what's your ethnic group"" instead of ""where are you from"" or ""what's your nationality"". 

In a non confrontational way I will correct them and say ""you probably mean to say \_\_\_\_\_"" and hope that in the future when they ask another minority they'll say that instead of the usual lines that we've all become so use to hearing."
2,spc2o1,Have any of you fallen into this trap as a poc? I know I have. I sometimes forget Asians are born here and didn't immigrate here like I did. I feel like shit afterwards.
3,spc2o1,"Just at a work function and had one of these interactions.  Worst part, guy that kept pressing me on this, white, said his wife is Asian American, but she’s “American enough” because of some nonsense reasons. Fuck does that mean?  I feel bad for their kids, going to have the worst identity problems with a dad like that.

Nothing about being married to a minority makes you not racist."

5,spc2o1,"Along the same lines, here are some choice quotes from [Daniel Quan-Watson's response](https://www.csps-efpc.gc.ca/video/questions-on-racism-eng.aspx) ([PDF transcript](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/tbs-sct/documents/living-digital/20210623-LD-article-response-e.pdf)) to Rex Murphy asking how racist Canada was:

> A Canadian Border Services Agency officer told me that I could not use the line that I was in because it was for Canadians only. I was actually travelling on a Canadian Diplomatic passport having represented Canada abroad. He had not checked my passport before making the comment.

> A Canadian airline employee told me that I could not board a flight from New York City to Canada because I didn’t have an entry visa in my passport. The employee was actually holding my Canadian official diplomatic passport in their hand while saying this, a document that NEVER requires a visa for a Canadian to enter the country.

>  my sister was being held up at
secondary inspection coming off her international flight because the officer could not grasp what her status was in Canada, despite the fact that she held a Canadian passport. In case you’re tempted to think that it was something else, the question was asked repeatedly, “But what is your STATUS in Canada?”. As the passport says, Citizen . . .

> I have been told at Canadian missions abroad that I couldn’t use certain parts of the facilities because only Canadians had access to those particular areas. We hadn’t yet had the conversation about my citizenship and I was in fact a very senior federal government official.

(""very senior"" is an understatement: he is one of 38 deputy ministers in Canada.  It's not quite a Cabinet-level position, but he was almost certainly multiple levels above whoever was telling him bits of the building were off limits.)"
6,spc2o1,"“What’s your shirt? Tommy Hilfiger?”
“No tom Haverford. I payed 100 dollars to get it monogrammed”"
7,spc2o1,"Frankly, I get tired of people playing detective. I don't care if someone is genuinely curious. If someone asks me and I say ""Philadelphia"" and I CLEARLY sound like I am from the working-class area, I really have no interest in going further. 

It's different if they ask about my ethnic background, though. I typically answer, ""why? You writing an article about it?"""
8,spc2o1,"""No, where are you from-from"" is usually what follows"
9,spc2o1,"There was a short funny video of a Vietnamese woman saying she's from some city in America.  But when they pressed the question, she looked pissed and said in a heavy Vietnamese accent, ""I come from the great land of Vietnam!"" 


Anyone wanna help me with a source plz?"
10,spc2o1,I laughed.  Not sure where this is from though.
11,spc2o1,"To me, the accent and how well one can speak ""American"" is a good indicator.  True, you could be from the UK, although again the accent or certain words used.  Then again I use British slang just to screw with people.  Or you could just be talented at language.  But a lot easier to tell, than just by looks."

1,n8ejeu,Very happy she’s doing this. The idea that Southeast Asian people have more in common with East Asians than South Asians feels like a myth but I guess that’s just semantics.
2,n8ejeu,"Always glad to see celebrities using their platform to spread awareness. Ofc would be nice to also get some South Asian solidarity in there but it's also fair to recognize that 1) hashtags are really blunt instruments and 2) while all of East, Southeast and South asians experience racism in western (and eastern!) countries, the face of that racism, the things which feed it, and the messaging to treat it can be distinct.

On a tangent - and this isn't going to harm reception more widely - but as someone who used to play a fair amount of CSGO, my first association with ESEA was not ""East and Southeast Asians"" but ""E-Sports Entertainment & Association League"" haha"
3,n8ejeu,"StopESEASAhate would've been ideal, plenty of South Asians are harassed for the same reasons East Asians are (e.g covid spikes). We have to come together as an Asian community which includes All colors in Asia proper (48 countries not including Middle East)."

From the ingrained colorist beliefs that fairer skin is superior, self hatred for possessing traditionally Asian physical traits that are deemed ""ugly"" and ""undesirable"" by western beauty standards, to the praise for having European colonial settler ancestors. The personal beliefs of some Asian Americans is one that believes in racism and racial hierarchy with white people at the top. These people hold themselves to a higher esteem because they believe themselves closer to white people, perpetuated by us being the ""model monitory"" that other minorities should strive to be, and hold disdain for the people below them, and it clearly shows from how some asians regard black and Latino people. 

I can understand the older generation because they literally grew up under colonial/imperialist occupation and had these beliefs drilled into them by western occupation, but some of these beliefs are held by the youth, and it absolutely destroys me whenever they play into the model minority myth and believe themselves superior and their struggles separate to that of our black brothers and sisters. Our struggles against racism and hate are sourced from the same system that oppresses black people and demonizes Muslims and prohibits central and South Americans, the sooner we realize our shared struggle the sooner we can end this cycle.

Is this equivalent to Fox News pushing or promoting anything? News channels have all sorts of people on their programs all the time.

1,t3pwci,"There was a post circling in one of the interesting subreddits about a place that had a 45 year old perpetual stew in bangkok. One of the most top voted comments is about how the next pandemic is going to crawl out of it, and there were several ""ew thats gross"" or ""ew covid"" comments. I reported all of it and so far its ""this doesnt violate reddit policy"". Nothing in attitude has really changed towards asians, at least amongst general reddit users. Considering the PRC is looking at Taiwan pretty hungrily right now i dont think the sentiment is going to change anytime soon."
2,t3pwci,"I am such Russian-speaker (Jewish specifically, but with stereotypical Russian surname) from the US. And yeah, I wish more messages of encouragement were given to my Asian-American compatriots. I have been vocal about the rise in racism and hate crimes ever since the pandemic started, because many of my friends are East and Southeast Asian Americans. I agree that many Russians and Russian speakers won't likely endure the same amount of hatred that Asians have because many are 'white-passing' as the term is used. 

I know in history that this has already happened. German immigrants were assaulted and their culture erased amid the breakout of WWI. FDR interned Japanese-Americans into concentration camps after Pearl Harbor. Muslims, Middle Easterners, and South Asians have been subjected to hate crimes and racial abuse ever since the War on Terror has started. I am worried that as China-US relations become more hostile, the effect will be felt among US-based Asians, and we'll see more violence and discrimination among them.

All this makes me think that racism, xenophobia in the US is a feature, not a bug."
3,t3pwci,Similar sentiment? We can't even keep posts about attacks on Asians from being locked on our own subreddit.
4,t3pwci,"Yeah everybody is rightfully sympathetic to the Russian people but the second china aggresses slightly, you can expect these poor east Asian store owners and students and elders will be harassed, beat, executed left and right in the streets.

5,t3pwci,There was a Ukrainian support rally last weekend in my city. I thought it was nice. But at the same time I was thinking no one really came out to support the anti-Asian hate rally except Asian people. Another thing I notice is that people will say fuck Putin instead of fuck Russia. So people do seem to be able to differentiate. Where as when it comes to China. You see a lot of people say fuck China. But you never see people say fuck Xi
6,t3pwci,"White privilege is very real, and we're a bunch of NPCs as far as the West is concerned. That's all..."
7,t3pwci,"> Was there similar sentiment?

Not really. Any posts about the assaults on AAPI outside of the Asian specific subs had very little to no activity. It's sad. They consume our culture but have zero appreciation or concern for the people."
8,t3pwci,"Asians are not white, much easier to dehumanize."
9,t3pwci,They've even excused racism against the students at border control
10,t3pwci,"Hey at least the top comment over on that link was someone calling out folks for attacking and rationalizing why attacking Asian Americans in the States and trying to get folks to see the double standard when it comes to non-white people and white people. 

The butthurt Americans in those comments (and some of the others on that post) are exactly why propaganda is the most powerful tool when it comes to geopolitics and getting a population to go and fight other people. I was overseas in Afghanistan and saw how propaganda works in dehumanizing the ""enemy"" and getting folks to find reasons to kill others. 

Note: I was very disappointed in how the government handled leaving Afghanistan and if we go to war in the Ukraine we could be there for another 20 years again (and will most likely use the same exit strategy that we have used time and time again). I love soldiering and all that but these folks in the States who constantly push for war better sign up for it and be out in the field with me otherwise they can shut up about the US getting involved."

Honestly if that's where it happened that's not ENTIRELY Netflix's fault. It's just a shitty code that automatically took the top credits of each of it's **thousands** of movies and shows and popped it in with no human interaction.

And by shitty code, I mean it's **REALLY** shitty because I tried looking at other movies for examples of this and couldn't find any.

I could be wrong though. It could actually be a person doing this mundane thing for everything Netflix gets to it's library"

With that in mind, I wouldn't say this is calculated racism on Netflix's part. More of how the overall industry doesn't value Asian American/diverse actors, so they automatically listed people like Harvey Fierstein (who voiced Yao) above Ming-Na Wen.  
Still, the fact that it resulted in this total oversight, is not cool. Is this an example of institutionalized racism?"
5,acimob," Don't think it was intentional on Netflix's part, but a lot of the problems with automating crap like this is that it exposes just how stacked every single institution is against non-white minorities.

Wasn't there a similar computer-automated process at Google for their resume search process where the program developed was based on previous criteria for hiring...therefore it instantly started to weed out black people and women of all races?"
6,acimob,Netflix has been caught doing scummy anti Asian things in the past as well. Such as nonsensically removing a kiss scene between an Asian couple and altering subtitles to push western stereotypes. Looks like one of their racist editors really get triggered by Asians.

4,uovout,"""POC"" just means non-white. I'm East Asian and I've never thought that I was ""white"" or ""white-adjacent"". I think people paint with a broad brush and assume that all East Asians are upper-middle class professionals. I grew up working-class with parents who don't speak English and work blue-collar jobs. If I told them that they were ""white-adjacent"", they would think I am being ridiculous. My parents are the types to collect empty soda cans to redeem them for money and get food from food pantries regularly.

When my dad was stopped at a traffic stop, the police pointed the gun at him and my dad kept shouting that he didn't speak English and yelling at them in frustration and honestly, it was terrifying because he could have been shot. I guess he was lucky he didn't. Does that make it ""Asian privilege""?

Also, I wouldn't agree that most East Asians are light/pale. That might be what the media portrays but there are many darker-skinned East Asians.

EDIT: The term the University of California (UC) system uses to exclude Asians is ""under-represented minorities"" or URMs. Also, the narrative that East Asians are more privileged than other Asians is kind of weird. [Indian-Americans are the highest-earning ethnic group in the US and Filipino-Americans also have higher average incomes than Asian-Americans overall.](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/04/29/key-facts-about-asian-americans/#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20the%20median%20annual,%2485%2C000) We earn less money than other Asians yet we're seen as privileged because we have lighter skin?"

Granted I’m half white and look somewhat ambiguous, but I am tan, have almond-shaped eyes, and thick, jet black hair lol. 

Personally, I’m actually just not a fan of BIPOC, PoC, non-white, etc. to describe people who aren’t white in the US. If an issue specially affects Asians, then say Asians. If it specifically affects black people, then say say black people. We all have diverse communities and face different, complicated issues in this country. For instance, BIPOC was created specifically because PoC was being used as a blanket term to discuss all people who aren’t white in this country and it resulted in diminishing black people’s struggles in many instances. But, in my opinion, the new term now just diminishes our struggles as Asian Americans. So even if it isn’t convenient, I think we should be specific and intentional with our language. 

Even within Asian American communities it can be important to be more specific sometimes. Lao Americans face almost a 40% high school drop out rate, a higher poverty rate than both the national and purely Asian American average, etc."

White nationalism sees us all as a monolithic “colored people”. They’re simultaneously trying to court asian americans to side with white people while being afraid of our growing numbers."
16,uovout,"There are people in this sub that loses their shit and write a dissertation validating that asians are white adjacent so we have a long way to go in getting Asian discrimination recognized. You just cannot force asians into a solely black and white racial spectrum. It doesn't work. That's like trying to tell black people they should succeed more if they were more like model minorities.

Most people don't know what racism us. They don't know what prejudice is. They only know the current spectrum of civil rights because it's a trending issue. If it wasn't, none of them would care. And at the end of the day, those who spend too much effort trying to define lines of racism or minority demographic tend to be racist themselves. No ordinary people does that in real life."
17,uovout,"Its the model minority myth and systemic racism all put in together. It is a PERFECT example of systemic racism.

Asian's are looked @ and stereotyped as ""honorary white people"". While its true that culturally and statistically Asian's do have higher levels of wealth and education compared to other POC. It does serve as a detrimental stereotype. Because it allows oppressors to use this stereotype to hold down other minorities.

""Hey you other POC's... Why can't you be like the Asians with their good grades and hard work ethics? they dont rob banks...""

However at the same time oppressive groups have no problems blaming or scape goating Asian's for all their problems. Example is. Covid 19 for example.
Or High real estate prices in Canada. Stealing jobs. Etc etc.

@ the same time. It also DEMINISHES struggles that Asian's face as a POC. For example the generational poverty and gang activity that faces south east Asian groups. In the USA we have Hmong and Cambodian gangs that can be extremely violent and volatile. In Canada, there are  decedents of Vietnamese immigrants who live in poverty. And/Or have generational gangs and crime they are involved in."

Although perhaps it's a more extreme version of the move to BIPOC vs POC."
21,uovout,Even as a south Asian I feel like people don’t consider me a minority…
22,uovout,"TL;DR - In my opinion, ""POC"" is not a good term to use anyway.

I think the usage of the term ""people of color"" has become outdated and potentially problematic. People who use it don't seem to realize it is a white-centric idea: people of color are people who aren't *white*.

In a world of white supremacy (i.e., white = privilege, all others = oppressed), it serves a ideological purpose. But in the real world, where race plays an important part, but so do socioeconomic status, geography, education, personality etc., it forces people to 1) acknowledge that a white race exists and always will, 2) you are either white or not white, and 3) your whiteness or non-whiteness says something about your privilege. This is something that was possibly true 40 years ago, but no longer so in most places IMO (at least where the term is used).

As an added wrinkle, it seems like for most other races, this is quite clear-cut, but for Asians, it gets complicated. If you are a well-to-do East Asian, you are white-adjacent; if not, you are of color. For some, the existence of many well-to-do Asians means the whole race—all 50+ ethnic groups (based on countries alone)—is white-adjacent. This is obviously wrong and problematic.

There is also a dynamic at play between East vs. Southeast Asians, but this exists within any other society / large group of people. You wouldn't call a wealthy, privileged Black person white ... ever, so it isn't about generalized privilege per se. But if it's not about privilege, then why does it even exist as a way to describe anything? In the same way ""Asians"" are pretty much arbitrary (i.e., the only connection really is having ancestry from the largest and most populous continent), ""people of color"" arbitrarily links people with little connections together.

I wouldn't voluntarily describe myself as a POC, in the same way I don't just go around telling people I like green shirts—it technically would be true (and it'd be weird for people to tell me it isn't), but it is so arbitrary that it doesn't serve a purpose. The reason why I think it can be problematic is what it implies: that ""I'm not white and that means something"" and that either that's a good thing or a bad thing. I don't think it's a good way to go through life."
23,uovout,"There’s also historical precedent that categorized South Asians as white whereas East Asian non-white, so it’s a complicated issue. I always identify as POC, though in related discussions I’ll be sensitive to Black and indigenous folk who are present. The model minority myth really fucked things up for a lot of us, and sadly there are still Asians (particularly EAs) that push the narrative."
24,uovout,Yeah other minorities can be pretty fucking racist to us.
25,uovout,"It's so weird being Asian because we experience racism so differently than others (speaking in broad generalizations of course). We dont necessarily get aggressive hate, but we get passive and dismissive stereotypes. As if Asians don't go through hardships like other minorities do. That were fine and there's nothing to worry about.

Setting up a business on yelp, you have the option to add these little tags like ""black owned business, latin owned business, woman owned business"" but nothing for asian-owned. And it's quite frustrating that I can't celebrate my diversity like the others"
26,uovout,"someone told me once, ""if you just put on sunglasses, no one would even know you weren't white."" fuck outta here."
27,uovout,I don't think it's based on appearances or skin color though
28,uovout,"And thus the model minority myth does the work of its white authors by forcing a wedge between East Asians and other POC 

Whenever you see comments like this, that “East Asians are not POC,” ask the author of those comments why they are doing the work of whiteness that divides the solidarity of people of color? 

If you can get ahold of Ellen Wu’s book “The Color of Success: Asian Americans and the Origins of the Model Minority” even the first chapter alone is a powerful history tracking the ways in which whiteness recast “yellow peril” to “model minority” to drive a wedge particularly between Asian and Black solidarity 

Here is a more generalized article

TL;DR 

Casting East Asians as non-POC is a poisonous symptom of the false “model minority myth” that seeks to chisel away at POC solidarity and undermine those alliances that would otherwise pose a threat to whiteness"

32,uovout,"Let's be real. POC is only used in the context of discrimination. Asians are seen as a model minority/affluent minority. So our ""challenges"" are different than that of the black/brown community and quite often marginalized. ""Oh boo hoo, you can't get minority admission points at Harvard and have to settle for U Penn, excuse me while I try not to get shot by police while hanging outside a convenience store."""
33,uovout,"POC is a dumb term anyways, let's lump everyone who isn't white into the same group. As if non-whites all share the same beliefs, culture, etc. Shit even among just Asians we have a huge variety of people. 

Personally I find the term hugely offensive."
34,uovout,I have experienced this a lot. My honest reaction has been to basically abandon the term and just identify as Korean American or East Asian American. It sort of helped me disassociate myself from other POCs and become more numb to their plight.
35,uovout,"I wrote a paper on growing up Asian in Canada, and my professor told me to use a different term than ""person of colour"". I never clarified, but I'm pretty sure it was because I was East Asian and thus ""not a POC""..."

38,uovout,"Honestly most white peoples excuse for why we supposedly aren’t POC is pathetic. 

Usually asking them the single question of “so are we white then? Are we European then?” has them sweating bullets. 

Race is a geographic concept, not necessarily a colour concept. A light coloured Arab person who is white passing becomes un-white the minute they reveal their usually-Arabic-sounding name. Same for other white passing mixed race people. 

White people will always try to deflect by saying this is a matter of “seeing colour” or some other nonsense. It’s the simple fact that they don’t respect any continent other than Europe, and if you’re not from there, they ipso facto do not respect you/us.

Literally a pasty white guy who said he was from Mexico(white Mexicans exists but apparently his white ass thinks he's a POC) tried to dismiss me on this topic before on how Asians, specifically East Asians are not POC on a video of an Asian girl who looked SE Asian to me.

There are over a billion East Asians. A lot of  them are going to be * shocked face * brown."
40,uovout,Well they say we're yellow
41,uovout,"First comment here but I hate the term, ""PoC."" It's ""colored people,"" with extra syllables.  It's history repeating itself, but rebranded and repackaged.  Reluctantly waiting for segregation to happen again but at this point, people will be manipulated enough to do it themselves."
42,uovout,"I've never heard of people thinking that POC doesn't apply to East Asians. However, I know that using the term ""minority"" can be confusing sometimes because who is a minority depends on the context. As for the school in Washington that lumped White and Asian students together, well people can manipulate data all they want."
43,uovout,"Asian Americans aren’t a monolith, the same way Latinx is not a monolith. East Asians are doing better in this country because of two main factors: Firstly, immigrants from China/Japan (from the 60’s onward) tended to be highly educated already-affluent people, while a lot of Koreans were war-brides and their families. So they already had resources once they got to the US. Secondly, cuz of white racism’s model minority myth to justify racism towards black people, the US became less racist towards Asians which resulted in better economic outcomes for Asian-Americans. But Southeast Asians (Vietnamese, Cambodian, Lao, Hmong) tended to be refugees, so they didn’t have the same resources and to this day are more likely to live in poverty.

But just because some groups of Asians are doing better than other groups doesn’t mean the same racism doesn’t affect them both. Like, poor Asian American are less likely to seek out assistance because they’re unaware that they qualify, and government is less likely to assume they need it. And Asian students are less likely to receive help in math and science because it’s assumed they’re already good at it.

Perhaps what PoC should just mean ""someone who is negatively affected by racism"". If we were to base it purely on skin color, then it only highlights how race is a construct. Like how is a southern Italian with a summer tan has darker skin than a northern Chinese person in the winter but only the former is considered white. Are Middle-Eastern people considered white or not? How much African heritage makes you black, especially in the aftermath of the ""one drop rule"" and how most black Americans that can trace their root to slavery have at least one white ancestor?"
44,uovout,"I see this most often around sanctimonious white liberals/leftists but not exclusively. I see two roots of it.

One is that United States racial discourse, despite hand-wringing over the need to do so, still hasn't really adapted to the demographic reality of the country in the 21st century: that a black-white binary is no longer tenable (or its permutation the ""black and brown""-white binary). This is less of a problem in places like Los Angeles or NYC and other large metros where the Asian population is so large that it can't be ignored, but these places remain the exception.

Social science frameworks also continue to constrict how people think about this stuff. The notion of ""assimilation"" -- how close you are to being white and how far you are to being black -- is a way for people to take stereotypes about Asian social position and ""round up"" to white. Hence all the formulaic ""white adjacent"" stuff that people have heard mentioned below.

It's going to be a long fight to combat this stupidity, but the violence of the past two year has woken some people up, I think."
45,uovout,It’s because East Asian don’t fit the narrative. It hard to claim systemic racism if Asian people come over here with nothing and work their way up to middle classes. You notice its the left that claim this. The right doesn’t consider East Asians white
46,uovout,"That's why I don't mind when people call us ""yellow"". Calling us yellow only serves to make us look like we have more in common with minorities than having white privilege."
47,uovout,Don’t you think poc is already wrong?
48,uovout,"We’re too successful (in most peoples eyes) to be a true minority… being oppressed, prejudiced or systemically wronged. I mean ffs have you seen some colleges diversity reports? They literally say every racial group and then whites and Asians are grouped together lol"
49,uovout,"This is why I prefer the term ""racialized group"" ([as used in Canada](https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/racial-discrimination-race-and-racism-fact-sheet)) as opposed to POC.  Race is entirely a social construct and there are many metrics in which a group of people can become viewed in a racial lens - skin colour being only one of them (not to mention colourism can also exists among members of the same ethnic group and is a serious problem in many parts of the world).  Think about the racist ideas that the Nazis held like how Jews, Aryans, Slavs, etc. were all considered distinct races, how scientific racism used to see race in terms of skeletal shape regardless of skin colour or how Roma and Travellers are racialized and marginalized in contemporary Europe even though they would likely be considered ""White"" in the US."
50,uovout,"I've never heard this. If East Asians are excluded from the term POC, it has more to do with their social standing, and perhaps how/why they ended up here. If we're speaking of skin color, well, East Asians aren't naturally lily white. Hell, unless you mean POC to mean black people, most of us aren't."
51,uovout,"They are white and not people of color. However, they are treated in racist ways due to there skin color. A more appropriate term is marginalized races"
52,uovout,I am black and don’t like being lumped with other non whites. We do not have the same issues and you all are more likely to be accepted by whites. Also other non white cultures do not like people historically or dark skin.
53,uovout,[removed]
54,uovout,"In the US, asians are richer than avg, so people want to take them out of ""POC"" status so that they can continue to claim that society is white supremacist.

If american society is white supremacist, why are asians doing so well? That's the question they are trying to ""cancel"" by removing asians from POC."
55,uovout,[removed]
56,uovout,"I guess you take the meaning literally, sure but that's like saying light skin Africans are not black or a super tan white person isn't white...."
57,uovout,What's POC?
58,uovout,"Yes, but I don't think it's any specific attempt to exclude Asians, contrary to other commenters here.  It (poc) just started with the black/African American community, which was based on skin color, which then transferred to other brown skinned folk.  I don't think it's intentional, I think people are just used to associating it with skin tone.  
  
My response is always: the Asian eye/eye folds are a physical difference that is visible to everybody that I cannot change or hide.  So it meets all the criteria that skin color does for 'poc', and so, Asians are included."
0,st8yi4,"The more I've read on this story and another story from a different victim of the murderer, the more I feel absolutely sick to my stomach. The justice system failed and allowed this to happen.

2,st8yi4,"Screams That ‘Went Quiet’: Prosecutors’ Account of Chinatown Killing

Christina Yuna Lee, who was described as “irreplaceable,” was stabbed to death in her apartment after a man followed her into her building.

Police officers who responded to a 911 call about a disturbance in a Lower Manhattan building on Sunday heard a woman screaming when they reached the sixth floor, but the door to the apartment where the screams had come from was locked.

As police struggled with the door, at first they still heard her calls for help, but “then she went quiet,” a prosecutor, Dafna Yoran, said in a Manhattan Criminal Court hearing on Monday night. Another voice emerged, sounding like a woman and telling them, “‘We don’t need the police here — go away.’”

When a specialized police unit arrived and broke down the door, they found Christina Yuna Lee, 35, dead in her bathtub with more than 40 stab wounds. The second voice, Ms. Yoran said, was actually that of Assamad Nash, who had followed the victim into the building on Chrystie Street in Chinatown, forced his way into her home and stabbed her.

When officers broke into the apartment, the police found Mr. Nash hiding under a bed and the knife believed to be the murder weapon hidden behind a dresser, prosecutors said.
Mr. Nash, 25, whose last known address was a men’s homeless shelter in the Bowery, was arraigned on first-degree charges of murder, burglary and sexually motivated burglary. A judge ordered him held without bail, and prosecutors said he was facing a sentence of up to 25 years to life in prison if convicted.

Though the authorities have not determined that Ms. Lee was targeted because of her ethnicity, her killing stoked fears in the city’s Asian community, which was already on edge after a rise in attacks during the pandemic.

Her killing also fit a pattern that has become an unsettlingly common feature of the pandemic in New York City: a seemingly unprovoked attack in which the person charged is a homeless man. In many neighborhoods in Manhattan, residents have expressed growing concern about homeless people, some of whom seem to be struggling with mental illness, menacing and harassing passers-by.

Ms. Lee, who graduated from Rutgers University in 2008 with a bachelor’s degree in art history, worked as a creative producer for Splice, an online music platform based in New York City. The company said in a statement that it was heartbroken over her “senseless” death.
Kenneth Takanami Herman, a colleague who said he befriended Ms. Lee on the job, paid tribute to her in a Twitter post describing how they bonded last year after the Atlanta spa shootings, in which six Asian women died, over a shared goal to make the music industry more inclusive.

He said the last message in their workplace chat with their Asian colleagues came from Ms. Lee, wishing them a happy Lunar New Year.

“Christina was irreplaceable. Heartbroken or devastated doesn’t begin to cover it,” he said. “‘Now what?’ is the question that keeps ringing — what do we do as a community?”

At a vigil Monday morning, community organizers, workers and residents of Chinatown gathered across the street from Ms. Lee’s apartment to mourn her and to voice their fears.

Organizers handed out fliers with a map of where they said shelters are situated in Lower Manhattan, with the words “no more shelters” written across it.

“Should we be fearful every time we take a subway or every time we get on the street?” Mary Wang, one of the organizers of the vigil, said.

A proposed homeless shelter on East Broadway, a few blocks from where Ms. Lee was killed, has drawn fierce opposition from residents who say they fear it will make the neighborhood more dangerous.
The city announced plans for the shelter after four homeless men in the neighborhood, including an 83-year-old Chinese American, were killed in a 2019 rampage. Officials have said the shelter will cater to Chinese immigrants, with staff members who speak three Chinese dialects, but will be open to anyone.

Mae Lee, executive director of the Chinese Progressive Association, said the presence of the new shelter “doesn’t necessarily mean the community will be any less safe.” She added: “Asians are often stereotyped. It’s not right to have a stereotype of people who are homeless.”

Mr. Nash had a string of arrests dating to 2015 in New York and New Jersey on charges including assault, burglary and drug possession.

He proclaimed his innocence as detectives led him in handcuffs out of the Fifth Precinct station house on Elizabeth Street in Chinatown on Monday afternoon. “I didn’t kill anyone,” he said. “I don’t know what’s going on.”

In the aftermath of the killing, prosecutors and judges are facing scrutiny over how they handled his previous criminal cases.

In January, he was charged with criminal mischief and unlawful escape; the police said he was disabling MetroCard machines at several subway stations and tried to escape from a police van after his arrest.

The judge handling the case could have set bail on the escape charge, but prosecutors did not request it and Mr. Nash was released under supervision, according to court records. It is not clear whether the request for bail would have been granted if the prosecutors had asked for it.
Mayor Eric Adams, who was in Albany on Monday meeting with legislators, was asked during a news conference whether Mr. Nash was a “poster child” for the need to amend the state’s bail laws.

Mr. Adams rejected that suggestion. But the mayor, who has pushed for lawmakers to allow judges to set bail for people who they believe are dangerous, said the case deserved scrutiny because Mr. Nash should not have been on the streets.

“We need to really examine what happened here, where did we fail,” he said, before calling again to “close the loopholes that allow dangerous people to be on the streets.”

Outside Ms. Lee’s apartment on Monday, roses and other memorabilia accumulated and passers-by stopped to pay their respects.

Kristal Zhang, 31, and her partner, John Liu, 30, had driven from Whitestone, Queens, to leave a single white rose at the makeshift memorial. Ms. Zhang, an accountant who grew up in Chinatown, said that young Asian professionals have come to feel vulnerable no matter what precautions they take.

“We work late, we take a cab home, and it still happens,” she said, alluding to the way Ms. Lee’s killer entered her building.

Jacky Wong, 45, a founder of Concerned Citizens of East Broadway, which organized the vigil, said he believed Asian residents of New York are at greater risk.
“The list is getting longer and longer,” Mr. Wong said. “We can’t see an end.”

Mr. Wong said that at a vigil last month for Asians who had been killed or injured in recent attacks, he had carried an “empty flame” symbolizing that the next victim could be anyone.

“Unfortunately, it was Christina this time,” he said"
3,st8yi4,"The details of this crime are chilling and heartbreaking. Why isn’t there more media coverage?! New Yorkers should be outraged! There were so many chances to keep this repeat offender off the streets. 

Also, think about how the “suspect” was sound enough to quietly stalk the victim, rush into her apartment and lock the door, sexually assault her, imitate a woman’s voice to tell the officers to go away, tried to flee on the fire escape, hid the murder weapon (knife), hid under the bed as police rushed in, and proclaim in front of cameras that he is innocent…. It’s sickening. He needs to be punished for what he did."
4,st8yi4,"Absolute nightmare fuel. I don't have a political take on this. I moved out of Manhattan (Chinatown) recently and the news of violence against Asian women seems incessant. I know it is improper, but I can't help but imagine myself in her place. I know the street, might even recognize the exact location if I stare at the pictures too closely. I wish I can express my sympathies genuinely, at a remove, but it feels too close. God, I am sorry, I am so sorry for this woman and her family."
5,st8yi4,The hate and violence in recent times feels irreconcilable. Better to move to the suburbs than to live in constant fear.

# America’s long history of scapegoating its Asian citizens

## When leaders call COVID-19 the “China virus,” it harkens back to decades of state-sanctioned discrimination against Asian Americans.

BY [NINA STROCHLIC](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/contributors/s/nina-strochlic.html)

DANNY SATOW WAS walking home from a stroll around her neighborhood in Federal Way, a suburb just south of Seattle, when a heavy object slammed into her chest. A car whizzed by and a disembodied voice yelled a racial slur against Chinese people. The car melted into the rush of traffic, and Danny leaned over to pick up the liter of water that had hit her. Her collarbone stung, but she told herself it didn’t matter, she was fine. She stood still on the sidewalk and tried to channel her grandmother.

Growing up in New York, Danny rarely felt bigotry because of her Japanese heritage. But in the house she shared with her grandparents in Brooklyn, the past engulfed her imagination. Her grandfather, Eisaku ""Ace"" Hiromura, barely spoke of his experiences in World War II, but the medals hanging on his wall told of combat with the 442nd Infantry Regiment, a highly decorated unit of second-generation Japanese Americans. Her grandmother, Haruka ""Alice"" Kikuchi, regaled Danny with stories about being 20 years old and going to jitterbug dances held at the [Tanforan Racetrack](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/7-800-imprisoned-in-San-Bruno-for-just-one-crime-7251516.php) in California, where she and nearly 7,800 other Japanese-Americans were interred by the U.S. government. She and seven siblings slept on cots in horse stables.

Internment, she told her granddaughter, was a mistake. But she wasn’t bitter. We need to do better, Alice would say.

So when the water bottle hit her chest and the slur rang out, Danny, a 33-year-old physician’s assistant, thought of the optimism and poise her grandmother had maintained through her 101 years and counting. She kept walking. She was four blocks from home, but she burst into tears before she got to the end of the street.

In the months since the coronavirus pandemic began, thousands of Asians in the U.S. have become targets of harassment and assault. The racist incidents began as the first cases of coronavirus spread across China last December and disinformation reigned. As infections appeared in the U.S., President Trump repeatedly referred to COVID-19 as the ""China virus"" and ""Chinese flu,"" and [pushed](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackbrewster/2020/05/10/a-timeline-of-the-covid-19-wuhan-lab-origin-theory/#6f675c4c5aba) a disproved theory that it had originated in a Chinese lab. By April an [IPSOS poll](https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/center-for-public-integrity-poll-2020) found that three in 10 Americans blamed China or Chinese people for the virus.

For Asians in America, there is a new tension to daily life. Asian businesses and property have been [vandalized](https://abc30.com/fresno-mans-car-vandalized-with-racial-slurs-as-coronavirus-outbreak-continues-/5998945/) with racist tags. Random individuals have been physically assaulted, verbally harassed, and shunned across the country. There’s no official tally for how many incidents have occurred, but in late March, California Congresswoman Judy Chu [estimated](https://thehill.com/changing-america/respect/equality/490373-attacks-on-asian-americans-at-about-100-per-day-due-to) 100 hate crimes were being committed against Asian Americans each day.

This fear isn’t new. In the past century and a half, the United States has made laws and national policies out of discrimination against ethnic groups, from the Chinese Exclusion Act to Japanese internment during World War II. Historians and activists fear that today’s targeted political rhetoric and harassment mirrors moments in U.S. history when racism became state-sanctioned.

## THE DISINFORMATION WAR

In mid-February, when there was only a single confirmed case of coronavirus in Los Angeles, a [16-year-old student](https://abc7.com/coronavirus-los-angeles-anti-asian-racism-novel-la-county-public-health/5929456/) was accused by another student of bringing the virus into his school from China. When he replied that he wasn’t Chinese, his classmate punched him in the head 20 times. He ended up in the emergency room.

Manjusha Kulkarni was surprised. As the executive director of the Asian Pacific Planning and Policy Council (A3PCON), a coalition of organizations that represents 1.5 million Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in Los Angeles County, she has a deep knowledge of anti-Asian racism in America. So, she was surprised to even feel surprised. Compared to African Americans and Latinos, Asians experience overtly violent racism less frequently, she says. (In fact, the “model minority” stereotype often pits Asian Americans directly against other minorities.) Plus, this was in a school. And the virus hadn’t yet gripped LA.

“So what does that say about the spread of the contagion of racism?” Kulkarni says. “It actually moves much more quickly than the disease.”

As the incidents of harassment against Asians rose, A3PCON asked the California attorney general’s office to collect data. It declined, so the organization built its own reporting pipeline. Within two weeks of launching on March 19, the [Stop AAPI Hate tracker](http://www.asianpacificpolicyandplanningcouncil.org/stop-aapi-hate/) had received nearly 700 reports. From across the country, people described being spit on in grocery stores, yelled at on their jogs, and called racist names while waiting in line. (As of August, they have collected over 2,600 incidents.)

It would be a mistake to think of these as isolated incidents. There is a recipe for growing seeds of hatred into exclusionary national policy, Kulkarni says: Begin with political leadership that elevates the fear. Stir in media support. Top off with popular culture that perpetuates stereotypes.

“You really need that whole ecosystem, but it’s very easy, when there are these underlying beliefs, for America to snap back into it,” says Kulkarni. “It’s a constant fight because these racist tropes are really part of the American fabric. They’re more American than not.”"

Question! if I oppose this article and what it's saying will I automatically start getting hate and labeled some kind of ""**racist**"" right-wing? I'm just asking prior to posting what I want to.

Actually fuck it...im gonna write....

This is not an **AMERICA** problem. This is a **HUMAN** problem. The thing is that these are both nouns and I can interchange them with any other **PROPER** noun and make the same type of statement with a story to back it. Lets be real! Let me give you some background.

The same issue this old Asian lady was subjected to recently in NY was the same type of garbage I was subjected to in NY in the early 90's. THIS IS NOT AN AMERICAN THING, this thing is a NORTH/NORTH EAST/FLORIDA thing. Belive me it is...I've been living in the SOUTH for 14 years and have not faced any issue like this...but growing up in NY and the NORTH EAST, this type of behavior was common place. So DO NOT blame america for this. BLAME the stupid ignorance in NEW YORK for this.

5,oci6o8,"> Please let’s not blame actor Mike Moh. He did what he could with what he was given.

It's a shame that some people ignored her request and have gone after him, as if he was just as responsible as QT for how Bruce was portrayed.  People need to realize he's only an actor; what were they expecting him to do?  Walk off the set?  Beat up Tarantino and Brad Pitt?  Plus I don't get why even Brad Pitt himself was getting flack for it.  Even he wasn't thrilled with how QT wrote the scene and could only convince him to rewrite the fight as a draw.  

No surprise the same type of white dudes who whitesplain about Bruce are also shitting on *Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings* for not being more like a Bruce Lee movie."
6,oci6o8,What pisses me off is how he is using our anger to enrich himself. As if we shouldn’t be something to fear.
7,oci6o8,"I'm actually a fan of Tarantino's, but this was just really disappointing. Not only because they did Bruce Lee dirty, but it didn't even make much of an impact in the film itself. Was it to build up Brad Pitt's character as a badass? It didn't seem that way, because if that was the goal Tarantino could've just played Bruce Lee straight and it would've been awesome. Not only did he turned what could've been one of the best depictions of Bruce Lee by someone who's not Bruce Lee, to something hugely disrespectful."

to take one of the VERY VERY FEW asian-american heroes in media and cut him down into a douchebag who can't fight when in reality he was a martial arts master--- it was so beyond disgusting. fuck quentin. fuck joe rogan. and fuck every white douche in hollywood and beyond who thought this portrayal was acceptable."
12,oci6o8,"Thanks for sharing this! I've been casually following the drama around Tarantino's depiction of Bruce Lee in OUATIH for however many months it's been going on. I've been a pretty big fan of Tarantino's work, but I definitely don't feel the same way about him after seeing all this clownery, including what he did to Uma Thurman."
13,oci6o8,"Quentin Tarantino has always rubbed me the wrong way since I found out that he basically ripped off the entire plot of City on Fire (an amazing 80s HK film starring Chow Yun Fat and Danny Lee) and released it in the US as Reservoir Dogs. He's obsessed with Asian specifically HK and Japanese action films and yet did not seem to give them the credit where it was due. Which is pretty bold since the entire style of film he's known for is almost completely derived from HK and Japanese action film tropes. He just made it marketable to Westerners

If you haven't seen these two movies, there's this video on youtube called ""Who Do You Think You're Fooling?"" which shows how similar City on Fire and Reservoir Dogs are... not only did Tarantino basically rip off the entire plot of City on Fire but he also took some scenes exactly FRAME BY FRAME

If he wanted to do an adaptation of City on Fire, he should have just asked. Martin Scorsese did an adaptation of Infernal Affairs and released it as The Departed, but the difference is that he was respectful, asked to adapt it, and acknowledges it as an adaptation. Seriously how hard is that? The disrespect....

Sorry this doesn't have to much to do with the actual post headline, just adding some more insight into as to how much Quentin Tarantino sucks"
14,oci6o8,Shannon’s such a queen. Her podcast is great too.
15,oci6o8,"I went to the Bruce Lee museum in Seattle and found a personal poem he wrote on a little piece of paper that reads:

“To live content with small means.

To seek elegance rather than luxury.

And refinement rather than fashion.

To be worthy, not respectable and wealthy, not rich.

To study hard, think quietly, talk gently.

In other words to let the spiritual unhidden and unconscious flow up through the common”

Now do you think the person in QT’s movie would actually have written something like that? He should have just created a completely different fictional person because that was the furthest from anything Bruce would have done or said. QT lives in a fictional world of movies and he mistook Bruce’s characters for his actual personality. Like a small child thinking Christopher Reeve is actually Superman or Bill Cosby is actually a nice fatherly figure. 

He’s also a creep with a foot fetish that worked with Weinstein constantly and mistreated Uma Thurman and builds his entire career off of stereotypes of minorities. The dude is irrelevant at this point."

Cool huh?” I could understand the angle that it’s some kind of hero fantasy for the Brad Pitt character but there’s no comeuppance, just pure fantasy."

22,oci6o8,"I have mix feelings about the whole QT & Bruce Lee in OUATINH and how the AA community reacting to the situation.

First.  I think QT is being dumbass on hows he handled and communicated things.  I don't think he's a racist.

Second.  Bruce Lee was my hero growing up.  Watched all of his movies multiple times, Read his books multiple times.  Loved his philosphy. I learned Wing Chun and nunchucks and escrima sticks as a result of being a fan of his.  

What I take issue with is that people think that Bruce Lee was infallible or unbeatable.  He is a legend and he is the modern grandfather of MMA.   Demetrius Mighty Mouse Johnson or Connor McGregor (at 145) are pretty comparable in athleticism and technical skills of Bruce Lee. They are both considered future UFC Hall of Famers.  But nobody believes or expects either of them to be able to beat somebody much bigger like Kamaru Usman (let alone a light heavyweight or heavyweight) despite being much faster and having much more technical striking.   Gene LeBell and Bruce Lee were friends and taught each other.  But as much as I love Bruce Lee, I think it's more plausible that Gene LeBell could toss Bruce Lee, or take him down and tap him out at will.  There were other grapplers that were just as good as LeBell.

As far as striking.  If we're pulling people from that era, I don't think Bruce Lee would beat [Apidej  Sit Hirun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wKYFc5AK_A) (crowned Muay Thai Fighter of the century by Thailand's King).   Bruce Lee was making movies full-time, Apidej had over 300 professional fights.  My point is there were people in that era that could beat Bruce.  That does not take away anything from Bruce Lee being a legend in martial arts.   

As far as Bruce Lee being arrogant.  I'm of the opinion that in order to call out a '[gong sau](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=gong%20sau)' or accept the challenge, you do have to have some level of arrogance.  To believe you are the world's greatest fighter and even believe that you can be, you're more than likely to be more arrogant than the average person.  And that's OK.   Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson, Connor McGregor, Jon Jones, Mayweather are all more arrogant than the normal person.  Because of that,  they are also more conscious and mindful of their negative thoughts and put a check on themselves.  Bruce does mention it in his writings.

Bruce Lee also [wrote a lot on ego](https://brucelee.com/podcast-blog/2018/9/19/116-ego-boundary).  If Bruce Lee was alive, how many fucks would he really have given?

This why I'm actually OK with Bruce Lee being beat in a fictional story.  It would be possible.  And most likely he would have given zero fucks about it."

0,um28kd,There's actually an academic paper that supports this: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2096296
1,um28kd,"I find any topic related to Asia (not just East Asia) is weirdly talked about on Reddit. You got larpers, Asia experts, and the ""my gf is Asian"", etc. Asia is like the peak foreign other to the majority out of touch white male Redditors"
2,um28kd,"As a Chinese-American, I can only say I wish people on this site were as kind when talking about China compared to Japan and South Korea. For every negative comment about Japan and South Korea, there's probably 1000 negative comments about China. Japan and South Korea aren't threats to the US. They're allies. China is seen as the real threat. I get to read nice comments from people saying they wish China could be nuked off of the planet, that China has a culture of cheating and that China has no culture because of the Cultural Revolution and needs to steal everything from everyone else (and this from people in the r/Korea sub). Everything negative that is said about Japan and South Korea is usually said about China too (racism, culture of overwork, eating dogs, etc.)."
3,um28kd,"I've noticed that quite a bit.

I've also noticed it's mostly white westerners who say these things (not all obviously).

White American guy who's never faced racism in his life goes to Japan and encounters some kind of Japanese racism and then declares Japan is the most racist country on Earth, and that in Japan no matter how long you stay there you will always be a ""foreigner/Gaijin"" and this is proof that Japan is racist.

Do I think Japan is racist? In some ways, yes. But I think every country has racist elements, it just changes who is the object of that racism, how it is instituted etc. And really, considering that racism in the West can result in actual violence, bodily harm or death, it looks really odd to try to call Japan the most racist when the racism in Japan very rarely rises to the level of racial violence seen in other countries.

People harp on how a white American guy living in Japan for 5+ years and becoming fluent in Japanese will still never be regarded as Japanese. I agree with that, but how ignorant can you be. There are plenty of parts of rural America (outside the coasts and major cities) where Asian Americans who are completely fluent in English, been here for multiple generations, have had family members fight and die for America, and they are still considered foreigners in the US. So the gall of a white guy who speaks foreigner-accented Japanese (even if fluent level) to be outraged that he will not be considered Japanese is ridiculous. And to add to that, foreigners in Japan are often treated differently/better (in some ways) than local Japanese.

I think the perspective of said person (if they are a white westerner) does matter. Since from their perspective, they may have never been the recipient of racism (from a different racial majority) so when they go to Japan and faced with some kind of discrimination from Japanese, it feels like they went from a racism-free home (from their perspective) to a place with racism (once again from their perspective).

Now an interesting aside is when I come across non-white foreigners and their experience in Japan. For example, the youtube channel Black Experience Japan has an interesting different take on what is a white-dominant viewpoint when it comes to foreign life in Japan. I do think they face interesting and unique challenges/prejudices in Japan that white foreigners don't. Some of the people they've interviewed do mention encountering racism in Japan, but they also acknowledge that there's racism in the US and that they might prefer the racism in Japan. It's a different perspective for sure."
4,um28kd,"I'm 4th gen JA and have only known life in the States. However, in my Uni days I made friends with a lot of international students who have since returned home. It is very common to hear my Japanese friends complain about those exact things. It's not just Westerners being overly critical, these are real issues in Japan. The reason for all the push back on it not being ""perfect anime land"" is, in my opinion, due to the amount of weebs who think Japan is going to be just like the anime they watch."

Many SE asian countries rely heavily on white tourists so they cater to their experience.

S Korea, Japan (and China) do not, so white people are not treated as special human beings there."
9,um28kd,Most of the issues leveled at Japan and South Korea can be turned around and leveled at America in a much bigger way. Corrupt policing? Racism? War crimes? The USA is the CEO of that triad.
10,um28kd,"Yeah, I noticed the same thing. South Korea and Japan being a threat to western cultural imperialism is, most likely, a part of it.  But I've also noticed a lot of other Asians  and POC saying the same negative things about Korea or Japan as well (plastic surgery, sexism, high suicide rates, etc). And they make it a point to say that they're only interested in the pop culture. Most posts talking about these negatives usually end up getting highly upvoted. And many who show any cultural interest in these countries is called a Koreaboo or Weeaboo. 

There is so much more interest in the U.S., England, and France collectively around the world, but are there derogatory terms (not talking about francophiles, anglophiles, etc) for people interested in these Western cultures? 

I've met so many people throughout my life who expressed strong interests in these (and other) Western countries, but the reaction they seem to get is mostly positive, as if it's natural, almost a given to have an interest in these places. But as soon a person shows a strong interest in S. Korea or Japan, they're labeled a festishizer by so many people out there. 

I'm genuinely curious to know why this is."
11,um28kd,"I completely agree with your observation regarding South Korea particularly with the rise of media visibility it's gotten. Something I've noticed is that this exaggerated scrutiny is coming from different kinds of people with different motives.

\- White or white-passing hispanic commenters I've seen on Facebook or Instagram hate on Korea/Korean media to pit it against Japan, which they see as a 'superior' culture. They think this Kpop/Kdrama popularity is undeserved and mainstream, so they bring it down. (ie. mass commenting on Squid Game S2 posts to say 'Alice in Borderland is better,' etc.)

\- Young Southeast Asians or South Asians who can be categorized as Koreaboos hate on people they call 'K-netizens' (Korean internet citizens) out of a weird possessiveness or appropriation of their favourite idols or actors (who they seem to forget...are also Korean lol) and rant on and on about how Koreans are racist, prejudiced, cruel, superficial, culturally regressive, and just plain stupid. 

The latter is a lot more prominent from cases I've seen tbh and I think it's interesting how because they are basically POC, they consider themselves victims of imagined Korean racism against them and believe they are not being the racists themselves."
12,um28kd,"Agree . Westerner love ignoring their issues and pointing at Japan and more recently Korea . 

And the only ""compliment"" they have to say about those countries is how quirky or ""good"" weird they are ."
13,um28kd,"Hey, what happened to the OP? Why does it now say ""This account has been suspended""?"
14,um28kd,"Japan certainly has issues; like that they used to be a master race country during WWII and were allowed to revision their history but I think most redditors are at the end of the day bunch of kids sitting behind a computer and that their only connection with the outside world with 90% of the people like that are on reddit.

South Korea also has issues and there are definitely nationalistic/racist issues in any country as well. I don't see how that's any particular problem.

The issue is that these countries are constantly viewed with American goggles or western goggles. Our problems are hyper focused by westerners yet our grievances and strifes are never considered.

Look at how Ukraine is being treated. Russia is the most evil due to rape but again Japan were allowed to revision their history because the west helped cover up a lot of the war crimes due to Unit 731 research notes and royal family's immunity during the unconditional surrender. As a result, generations of people who's been affected by Japanese mass rape were never given any justice. The very people garnering the west's sympathy had to apologize for comparing Hirohito to Hitler and Mussolini when the comparison is accurate. Pretty much shows how little the west actually knows about the eastern cultures and geopolitical situations and that they only want to see what's on the surface. As anyone can tell you, a feature of white privilege only it's for all westerners."
15,um28kd,"It's not because they're a threat. I mean Japan and South Korea get into political scuffles with each other, but they're both allies to the US and other democratic states. 

It's because of perception. Thailand and Vietnam are only seen by westerners as a nice place to vacation, but at the same time they are also seen as third world, third rate countries. 

Japan and South Korea are seen as both a nice place to vacation and a nice place in general. The circle jerk can be a bit much, but it's the equivalent of the ""perfect"" child who's actually a mess.

Like the ""perfect"" child objectively has a pretty good life, better than anyone who objectively has a bad life. But because that person is seen as ""perfect"" their issues are wholly ignored. 

No one's claiming Japan and South Korea has it worse than Qatar or Serbia (and anyone who claims that is just a dumbass). People just want East-Asian issues to be taken seriously.

But it is kinda true, at least outside of Reddit, for Japan and South Korea to be seen as a kind of perfect utopia that westerners want to emulate, without the Asians of course. Every once in awhile some conservative US politician wants to be like Japan, just all-white.

And it is also true that their issues are magnified because of how much they're ignored and even taken advantage of by westerners. White weebs literally attempting to commit sexual assault in Japan because of anime and hentai. 

Like, I get that sometimes reading it over and over again can be a bit much, but it's just an attempt to dispel the false perception westerners have of Asia. And yeah, it can be a bit exaggerated. 

Japan and South Korea aren't violently racist people. Obviously you're not gonna get stoned there for your skin color. But they are pretty socially racist for a developed country. 

Then again, almost every developed country is severely more racist than Americans, they just don't have any racism issues since almost every country is much more homogenous than the US too. 

Anyway, the point is all the threads about Japan and SK's issues aren't (or at least shouldn't) be about trying to say they're the worst. The point is to dispel the false perception, because false perceptions are harmful. For the falsely perceived, not the false perceivers."
16,um28kd,"Yeah I definitely notice this. When people expand on any criticisms of East Asian countries they very often end up falling into one of the pernicious, nonsensical stereotypes: Asians don't understand sex, Asians are undissenting and robotic, the philosophy and religion is mysterious and illogical, etc. There's lots of claims that run counter to objective facts.

And many of the criticisms that are more valid are a bit harder for the same people to make, since they have parallels here—conservative beliefs holding society back, lack of labor protections and excessive employer power, etc."
17,um28kd,"I cannot speak on South Korea, but I can speak on Japan as a biracial Japanese person born in Tokyo. My family experienced pretty bad racism there and my dad (who is Japanese) was nearly worked to death and denied promotion after promotion from his corporation. It wasn't until we moved to the States that changed significantly. We still experienced some racism/discrimination from Americans, but it wasn't nearly as constant as in Japan. In America, my dad was seen as a multilingual valuable asset who as long as his blended family didn't make an appearance, they continued to reward his hard work. Also, there are a few Japanese Nationalists who love to chase me around this site (and I wouldn't be surprised if one of those degenerates pops up here), though any/all could always be a white racist masquerading as a Japanese Nationalist.

That being said, I have heard that cultural views are changing in Japan with regards to opinions on immigrants and miscegenation (mixed race marriages), which is a huge shift from most of my life. However, years of Japanese people both in Japan and the US being less than kind to me definitely made an impact on my perspective on this."
18,um28kd,Apparently it’s because the moderators are white expats living in said country? At least with r/Korea that’s what I was told. I don’t understand why it’s sub is not called foreigners living in Korea. They ban for comparative argument against issues in America. Whataboutism I guess🙄
19,um28kd,"Tl;dr It's just reaction going the other way from the blind Japanese/Korean worship the internet had in the early 2000's. Now that the veil is being lifted a little they focus on the issues. And there are a ton of valid issues taking place in Japan/Korea that should rightly be criticized.

People in this thread are spot on about the racism stuff and how while it's there, the reason why people notice it is because it's the first time many white people have experienced it. But it's certainly there like you would have in many European countries.

Honestly I kinda see some of their bigger problems being stuff like the declining birth rate and loneliness of most people. I mean hiring a family or significant other for the day? Hikkikomori lifestyle? There are tons of other signals that show loneliness is a huge problem there. Their work culture as well is extremely toxic, debatebly moreso than American corporate culture. Going for such long hours yet having extremely low productivity

That actually leads into my next point about why their productivity is so low. It's more of a cultural difference than problem, is the bureaucracy. To get anything done you need like a bunch of paperwork and approvals from managers, and it takes forever to get anything done. Even for a Japanese person they need to take like a week off work to move homes. They often don't actually do meaningful work at their job because anything outside their express responsibilities needs to be confirmed with a manager, and his manager, and his manager going up the chain."
20,um28kd,"Weirdos obsessing over countries thousands of miles away from theirs. What else is new?

It’s not like these people will ever live in Japan or Korea or how Asia geopolitical actions will affect their personal lives. Just all strange to me.

“Asian people are the most racist.” I love hearing this all the time. No basis on reality at all"

23,um28kd,[deleted]
24,um28kd,"Dont think too much about it, this problem seems to be exclusive to Redditors only, and they have completely weird stances on lots of nations and cultures around the world

I think it's because a large portion of this website's users are young socially akward outcasts that basically have very little contact with the outside world, so when they want to discover something new or interesting about another country or whatever, they head to the internet and usually look for info from other Redditors who just talk out of their ass and blindly follow the narrative of their favourite news websites when the reality could be very different for all they know

I also think its very ironic how they portray themselves as some very liberal, forward thinking, inclusive people that never follow stereotypes, but when it's time to shit on some random country on r/worldnews or whatever, this suddenly becomes the most racist place on the internet and everyone in the comments just came in looking for an excuse to say something terrible about a certain nation. And sometimes they go along with the good old ""I only hate their government, not their people, BUT...""

Fact is that this platform is dominated by young white soyboys who struggle to realize what other countries are like, because they most likely don't travel that much and their introverted selves certainly don't have too many people of diffirent culture/race to talk to, so they commit to the circlejerk opinions since that's all they have

By the way, yea, I know its random that im commenting here since Im not asian american, but i accidentally stumbled upon it by typing ""Serbia"" (my country) in the search bar, and I felt like I could *sort of* relate to the topic, and lots of people around the world probably can"
25,um28kd,They are just projecting.  It makes them feel better about themselves to shit on others.
26,um28kd,"On the /r/antiwork sub, it’s common to see comments from expats who complain about Asia’s labor laws and how it’s worse when they’re literally on a sub showing the daily horrors of working in America."
27,um28kd,"Yes, there is. Because it exists, and people who wouldn't know, deserve to know, and also, it deserves to be called out. Is there really a need to say that lower case racism is ""not as bad"" as upper case racism when they all lead to harm?  


Also, I'd be interested in who is ""pointing this out constantly,"" what ethnicity/race they are, and why they're finding themselves in these countries in the first place."
28,um28kd,I just have issues with self hating koreans and korean diaspora who criticizes the country even though they never lived there. Korea has some issue but very exaggerated on internet.
29,um28kd,"I haven’t noticed this.. But I’m guessing it might be because a lot of people idealize Japan and South Korea, and when you put something on a pedestal, it’s bound to disappoint."
30,um28kd,"South Korea definitely has problems and I rather not ignore them or else they become even bigger issues that come back to bite us. Thats how I view it as a Korean American. 

Solve this shit now and don't have to deal with it later."
31,um28kd,Germans love to stare too.
32,um28kd,"Its what happens when people ""decide"" to see something through a lens and with confirmation bias. There are issues everywhere in the world. If you decide to actually live there and connect with the people, you will realize you will always find great, kind people who will vibe with you. I worked and lived in Korea at a hospital for couple years in the mid 2010s. I had alot of fun and met great people. 

Those people probably have issues with everything, starting with their immediate surroundings."
33,um28kd,When you come close to usurping the global order economically(China) or culturally(Korea and Japan) there will be pushback.
34,um28kd,What about North Korea giving South Korea a bad name? It’s not like Americans can tell the difference XD
35,um28kd,"yeah let's go ahead and sweep under the rug the legitimate widespread racism against POC in east Asian countries, esp against those minorities w darker skin (namely Africans and South Asians, in my experience)"
36,um28kd,How Serbia is racist?
37,um28kd,They do that because they are first world non-white countries.
38,um28kd,"I think this is so true. I mean I don’t support racism in the slightest, but if I went to Europe as an Asian I wouldn’t be outraged if I faced some racism. It’s like these people expect to be treated like they do in america (the country that was meant to be a melting pot)"

2,9kd4mf,"I feel like most Rom Coms I've seen have no spirit, it doesn't feel like the creators are putting their heart into the movie and are just doing it for a paycheck. 

The directors of CRA rejected the money from Netflix and the movie shows they worked hard to make a critically successful film that pleases everyone, not just AsAm

Besides that, a few reasons for their financial success are probably because 

* It was also a critical success and based on a book.
* Asian American cast is fresh and not your typical rom com plot
* Asians came out to support

If you put all the Asian Americans in the US. And put them on an island. That island would be placed as number 14th in the world for GDP. At the time these numbers were pulled, Turkey was ranked 14th. 

The population of this Asian American island is roughly 1/3 of the population of Turkey.

3,kvfp75,"Not quite on topic, but I think about how Asians tend to be perceived as younger than what they actually are and Black people tend to be perceived as older than they are, and I truly believe it’s because it’s all White is the implicit standard that Asian and Black people are compared to in terms in how we perceive age."

I resisted but got to the edge of the track when another man grabbed the guy and pulled him away from me then pulled me back on to the platform.  I sat there dazed while the train unloaded and re-loaded and took off.  My saviour got on that train and I never had a chance to thank him.  My attacker was still there but took off when I approached one of the security guards.  Why me?  I think that since I was the only Asian person there, that might be the reason."

Saw this on the news earlier. My grandfather said they deserved it for telling people what to do. How the fuck did they deserve it?

0,des3yw,It's racism pure and simple.  there was a similar post awhile back. Most White people don't think it's weird when they see a group of whites all hanging together but when it's a group of minorities they think they are being non inclusive or it's a gang
1,des3yw,"I remember a David Choi vlog a long time ago where he answered a white fan who asked why David only has Asian people in his videos and seems to only hang out with Asian people. The fan said he felt left out.

David was way nicer about it than he should've been and he said he doesn't have a racial preference for friends. He befriends anyone who is nice.

But really, the answer should've been like: Welcome to how I feel whenever I watch literally anything else on TV. If it made you uncomfortable, that's good. If you're a fan of my music, then you should be glad my videos and vlogs have made you feel uneasy, because this is the closest you'll ever get to knowing what it's like to move through the world as I do."

5,des3yw,"One of the reasons I hate my Midwestern town is the lack of Asian people. None of my white friends get it. I often say I want to move to a place where I csn be accepted more or at the very least, not stick out. I would love to move to the west coast, but the price tag is not in my budget. I think it's natural to gravitate towards people you have common experiences with. That's why even in my Asian lacking town, I seek out the few that are here, and also tend to develop friendships with other minorities and fellow immigrants."
6,des3yw,"I was on this grad school trip where I had never met ~70% of the people there. I befriended this guy who also happened to be the only other asian there.  

I ended up hanging out with mostly him for the rest of the week and some of the (non-asian) people I did know thought it was so strange that we were sticking together. Several people assumed that I was only hanging out with him because we had known each other from before grad school (one person asked if we were related). It was so bizarre.   

Meanwhile, all the Latin kids hung out together but no one was confused."
7,des3yw,"Where do you live where that's even noticed? I'm in the S.F. Bay Area, and have two separate sets of friends who don't intermingle, an Asian group and a mixed group. It's not by conscious decision; it's just the way it happened to work out."

I would have to drive at least 30min to be in a city that has more Asians and I'm too lazy to spend that much effort for social life. Basically my family is my only friends so that's why I only hang with 100% Asians. I have more online friends with similar hobbies and they're like 50/50 Asian/non-Asians. How many white, black or Hispanics people have good racial ratio of their friends?"
9,des3yw,My situation is kind of reverse from you. Most of my friend group now are people of other races. I live in the South so the Asian democratic isn’t huge but still in a college town so there is a good bit of Asian people. I just never felt like I “fit” in with other Asian people. Which in turn made me not want to be the dude who “only hung out with other Asian people”. I’ve recently tried to join my campus Asian Student Association but always never felt like I belonged. I want to be more sociable to other Asian people but there seems to be a mental disconnect for me when I try. It kind of sucks. I want to belong and be part of a group that understands me and my culture. I love having my diverse set of friends but sometimes they just don’t “get it” if that makes sense.
10,des3yw,"I assume you live in the US or a Western country. It's because you live in a White dominant society, so it is ""out of the ordinary."" Usually, a group of one (minority) race (black, Asian, Hispanic) tend to gravitate one another due to cultural similarities, beliefs, experience (whether it's oppression, immigration, community). 

Regardless, it's definitely a form of microaggression and those who point this out are simply ignorant, uncomfortable, or scared when they see something out of norm, being in a predominantly White society.

20,des3yw,My mom also called me out on this as well. Kinda annoys me too.
21,des3yw,"Dang, I don't see this as negatively as most of the comments here. Having only friends of a particular small minority could make it seem like you're being somewhat rebellious, like you're refusing to conform to general society and are drawing a line between yourself (based on ethnicity) and other people.

I don't endorse the view, but it's not unreasonable or immoral. It makes sense you'd be bothered by someone possibly showing signs of disliking your community, right?"

26,des3yw,"Most people just prefer being around their own race and culture, that's just how life and biology works. 

A lot of Asian men don't like being Asian. When they see groups of Asian men together, they want to dismantle that.  A lot of Asian men are against Asian culture and want Asians to assimilate into white and black culture instead."

1,9weeka,"This is not meant to diminish her accomplishments - she is justly a hero and an admirable figure - but in the interests of remembering history correctly, it should be noted that she ferried fighter planes, not flew them in combat.  Only the Russians had female fighter pilots in WW2, as far as I know.  The US didn't allow female fighter pilots at all until 1993.

She's also been recognized in a few media pieces; links here:

The post also misses one of the more remarkable parts of her life story. Shortly after qualifying for her pilot's license, she traveled to China by herself and tried to sign up for the Republic of China Air Force, but they repeatedly turned her down because she was a woman. She stayed in China until the Japanese invasion, when she survived the Japanese bombing of Guangzhou."

0,ua7895,There’s a 538 article that talks about [why people underestimate and ignore the nonwhite Americans who are particularly concerned about the environment](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-many-americans-underestimate-who-is-most-concerned-about-the-environment/)
1,ua7895,"Great job! I’ll just say, I’ve never seen more anti Asian racism than I have in environmentalist circles. So many rantings about how “cHInA ANd iNdIA aRe tHE rEal viLlAiNs.” Never mind the fact that I constantly got culture shock from how sheerly wasteful white Americans were. Or how western corporations outsourced their labor and their pollution to places like China, making the Chinese people suffer for it, but somehow the Chinese are still the ones at fault. Or how American infrastructure is so environmentally unfriendly because it was all made in the ‘70s while the Asian countries developing today put way more research into green infrastructure."
2,ua7895,"I plan on sharing this with my coworkers so they can be more aware of how POC are portrayed, even when not talking about matters obviously related to race. Thank you for the analysis.

I'm curious if anyone else thinks that this portrayal is just an extension of the white savior complex...? Or is there another concept that I'm unfamiliar with?"
3,ua7895,"I also notice there's a stark difference between how people treat different cultural practices.  When an activity that is common in the Western world is practiced unsustainably/unethically, activists will take a lot of effort to try to make the practice more sustainable but will also try to accommodate it if possible.  When similar practices are done by a minority or a non-Western country and it makes headlines, many will call for a blanket ban on the practice - typically showing zero cultural sensitivity or understanding or even considering any possibility to make the practice more sustainable or ethical (not to mention sometimes accusing them of having zero regard for the environment)."
4,ua7895,"Wow thank you for sharing this! I’ve only been somewhat aware of the BIPOC community’s relationship with nature through activities like climbing, camping, and hiking, but not from the perspective of documentaries so this is really eye opening. I think this is why it’s so important for more representation in these spaces— like we need more POC to make these documentaries."
5,ua7895,"Awesome job! Thank you.

White portrayal of Asians in media is especially dishonest. Just look at (practically) any headline. Asia is blamed for everything from using coal, cutting down trees, putting plastic into the ocean, and driving up energy prices. This is especially hypocritical since the ""developed"" Western nations (white) have done way worse for way longer, and still are on a per person basis, and are the cause of most of the problems or have outsourced them."
6,ua7895,"All the while whites do FAR MORE damage to the environment every single day, past present and future."
7,ua7895,"National Geographic has been under scrutiny recently for its racist past. Vox did a deeper investigation about National Geographic [here](https://www.vox.com/22417191/national-geographic-racial-reckoning). Junior Editors have been attempting to change the writing culture there, but it's been difficult. There's too much reliance on seniority.

Who are the notable Asian environmentalists, and do they have a harder time with filming documentaries?"
8,ua7895,"Well argued, clearly presented! Good on you!"
9,ua7895,"Wow this is so beautiful, good job and thank you for making it!

You know, I have always found it odd these hippie-like people who are in tune with nature and do yoga and stuff are stereotyped as white, when POC are more likely to live in places affected by climate change, be vegan, etc. Yoga and chakra are even of Indian origin!

I have always thought it may be an attempt at erasing POC from the movement (and from the fisherman video a shitty attempt to demonize POC), or big oil trying to turn away POC from environmental activism, or maybe pushing some sort of eco fascism agenda… but I’ll stop here before getting too conspiratorial without proof lol"
10,ua7895,"I’m Filipino American too :) I love this, you did an awesome job! You’ve definitely drawn attention to the issues in such a straightforward way. I’ve noticed this dichotomy in many documentaries but can’t always voice what exactly is “off” about how poc are portrayed. It can be so weird and subtle, like how you mentioned the sad music vs. not playing music. I’m going to be thinking about this for a long time."
11,ua7895,"This is awesome and so needed! As a ""white"" person I fully agree and have always felt it is an area of North American culture that is very under represented by POC. I'm glad where I live there are people like Ken Wu and David Suzuki, who have done so much for environmental protections in Canada. Great work, please keep it up!"
12,ua7895,Are you on Instagram? I'd like to reshare this on Instagram if you already posted it there.
13,ua7895,"Asian-men are heavily portrayed like crap, it has a lot of negativity impact on the mental. And it creates mental-blockages, etc."
14,ua7895,"Bro. Where are you located?

Not really directly about the environment but more about getting out there to enjoy the environment. These 2 groups are definitely geared towards more black representation but definitely still open to underrepresented minorities. https://growcyclingfoundation.org/ and https://colourthetrails.com/"
15,ua7895,"Ever heard about all the times that White American vegans (or variations thereof) lecture indigenous Arctic people about killing whales? Sure I would like them to stop killing such magnificent animals, but forcing a temperate vegan worldview on them does not work when they have sustainably lived off the polar land for thousands of years. Where do these geniuses think one is supposed to get green vegetables in polar zones? And after white people destroyed their traditional socioeconomic systems?"
16,ua7895,"Ever notice how POC cultural practices are either seen as fitting the ""noble savage"" trope (connection to the earth and the seasons! mystical, mysterious, ancient unlike white people culture which is too ""modern"") or they're just plain ""barbaric"" (polluting, poaching, inhumane and vicious with no regard to the earth) with nothing in between? Majority cultures are always dehumanizing others."
17,ua7895,Is there a link to this episode of Sea of Hope that you are talking about? I searched for it on Youtube and I see different episodes of Sea of Hope.
18,ua7895,"Consider the cultural backgrounds at play.

I know for one, climate change is not such a polarizing issue in many Asian countries and a lot of people really don't care. Not to say there aren't people who DO care, but it's simply not as much of a hot-button topic. For fast paced countries like Korea, thinking about what's going to happen in 100 years is not a priority.

Additionally, climate change won't stop with just America, Europe, and a handful of other areas and many Asians recognize this. The common idea is, ""why should we give up our nation's industrial growth when others won't?"" It's simply how most people (that I know) think. It's also not like they litter streets more often. Asians are very responsible with recycling and throwing away garbage... most of the time."
19,ua7895,"I think there are a few problems with this analysis, the largest being that Asians globally have a large and disproportionate effect on degrading the environment. It is no secret that Asia, and south east Asia in particular pollute the environment with little regard towards its health, and Chinese medicine fuels poaching globally. 

On the flip side, Europeans (and Japanese) disproportionately help to save the environment, due the their better educations and wealth. Also National Geographic is an American company so it should be expected that the majority of the cast is of European descent. 

I think it is good to show the positives and negatives of all issue, and clearly not all euros are saints and not all Asians are poachers but pretending they are on average equal isn’t going to help anyone. Global embarrassment for a country is often a catalyst for positive change."

Like the Covid bat thing. All the sudden all Chinese people eat bats. I don’t really see things getting better as American is upping the propaganda against China.

It isn’t morally wrong or bad to eat dogs because different cultures value different animals.

First off when people use it as a way to be little East Asian Americans ( it is disgusting ) I think any racism is absolutely disgusting and we shouldn’t stand for it. 


With that said while visiting family in both Taiwan and rural fujian we did have roasted dog , to me I love dogs and I personally see eating them the same as someone eating a cow ( as I grew up with baby cows realized they are not to different from other mammals like dogs ) 

I think those of us  epscially in the Chinese American community need to both not stand for the upfront racism aswell as confront our selves with the fact that there is a part of our culture ( if we are fujianese ) we maybe personally ashamed of.


As many redditors have stated, French eat horses , and other cultures eat things that might see different 

We can try to expose Americans to the greatness of Chinese culture through food, if we live in nyc or la take them to flushing sand have them fry

I could have completely misinterpreted that but it looked like they ordered some food to be cut up. That being said, I had horse, dog and other meats I don't remember. The stereotypes have to come from somewhere. I feel when I hear people say that, I usually assume they're the type of person who stopped school at 12 years old and fucks their sister.

If you're pumping yourself with big hoss country fried texas hamburgers, french fries and hotdogs in the US and the pasta mama mia red sauce and grandmama's old country gabagoul in Italy, it's unsurprising that you have much higher deathrates from a virus that puts people with diet-related diseases at higher risk."

I understand the ire at the guy who did the shoving, and I very much want him to be held accountable. But criticizing progressive reform is not productive.

The Asian American community has a duty to stand in solidarity with the movement for black lives, and part of that is understanding that our relationship with the police has implications for other minority groups.

Also glad to see Asian solidarity. I've been frustrated that when racism against Asians happens, some of my peers' first instinct is to say, ""I'm American!"" or ""I'm not Chinese."" It's like, don't you get that even if you're an Asian who is not American, or if you are Chinese, you still shouldn't have racism directed at you?

Angry because it such senseless act against people who are minding their own business and because it appears to be a certain age/gender/demographic that is doing these sick acts and sad because the last week it's been against senior citizens who were oblivious to the attack. That is someone's father, grandfather, friend that is attacked for no reason at all. 

I've been going to Oakland Chinatown throughout my life and it's always been a fairly quiet (for a Chinatown, compared to SF or NYC) and peaceful place that I've never felt in danger in. Just people going about their business like any other street in America.

Chin's murder and the acquittal of his murderers did respark racial activism within AAPI communities (which had faded a bit at the end of the 1970s). AAPI groups allied with and were inspired by the work of Black Civil Rights leaders and groups, which is something sometimes forgotten between our communities.

17,ra1ilq,"Unpopular opinion, but I don’t think there’s a good reason to be so offended by the question “where are you from”. 

There’s a saying out there that one should never mistake incompetence for hostility. I’m Indian myself, and I’ve found that often people are, to put it plainly, just interested in my ethnic background, and sometimes they either (1) just don’t have the “woke” language to be able to ask this with tact or (2) are probably feeling like they’re walking on eggshells and are a bit nervous. I usually say something like “if you’re asking about my ethnicity, I’m Indian-American, but I was raised in Pennsylvania”.

What I will say, however, is that it depends on the situation. After all, they might be put on edge if you say something like this, as it might make them feel guilty for being racist or something. But it’s often the intent behind what you’re saying that makes all the difference, and if you come from a place of warmth and understanding, I’ve found that these situations actually make for a refreshing kind of ice-breaker.

If someone is asking such a question about you, are they not interested in you and trying to get to know you better? Why not be flattered by that in itself? Sure, there might be a possibility that they’re thinking less of you in some way, but even if that’s the case, I don’t think it’s healthy to go through life assuming the worst of others’ intentions.

Just my two cents. If anyone has any strong opinions, please feel free to respond with your honest thoughts. I’m not trying to invalidate anyone’s experiences or anything like that, but at the same time I have no qualms sharing my experience either. I would be interested in starting a conversation about this."

10,n65j49,"I don't care for the comedian or character but his accent is pretty on par with that of Chinese Malaysians, which is his background. It's not done for the white gaze, IMO. I've watched the stand ups other material and he has pretty nuanced takes."
11,n65j49,Thank you so much for concisely putting down why Uncle Roger is harmful. I always found his humor boring and lazy because the Asian accent and mannerisms are the joke itself.
12,n65j49,Reminds me of the LingLing character from TwoSet Violin (they even have a sub with the name r/LingLing40hrs) And yet they keep insisting it’s a compliment to be called a LingLing 😶
13,n65j49,The thing that made me stop watching Uncle Rogers was how he snubbed Strictly Dumpling and his poor excuse to why he scrapped the video. It really showed his character and how much he'll compromise for the bigger cash payout.
14,n65j49,"I have very little to add here but to point out that contrary to what many of the commenters have said, [most Chinese Malaysians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6Fz8usO2TI) I know do *not* speak like Uncle Roger, and as a Chinese Malaysian myself his accent can't be more foreign and contrived to me. His accent is more of [an exaggerated Hong Kong Chinese accent](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/iy9mp1/malaysian_uncle_a_riceing_internet_star/g6dssvg/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) than [a typical Malaysian one](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/j12xgs/sorry_if_this_is_ignorant_but_i_hear_some/g6xd13i/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) (which is most similar to [Singlish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pb4XSy-d2Ck)). While it may very well be true that Malaysian Chinese who grow up speaking Cantonese have an accent that is more similar to his, to the best of my knowledge having grown up in the country for my whole life they are quite few and far between.

So no, it would be disingenuous to claim that ""how Malaysian Chinese people talk"" or ""they have that exact accent"" when this is at best only a very partial picture and at worst a non-truth that is very far from the case. I find it frustrating that people try to defend Nigel's overused shtick by claiming that his accent is that of a typical Malaysian Chinese, especially when it doesn't make his minstrelsy less lazy or uninspired even if it were true."
15,n65j49,"It's not as bad as the Lyle character by Bitwit which is just shallow mocking of Asian accents. I don't think Uncle Roger is specifically appealing to white people, he's pretty popular under Asians. The issue is more that he is satirizing first gen Asian immigrants, but thereby alienating western born Asians. For example what he said about Hersha was pretty rude. If you note his background, grown up in Malaysia and didn't move to the west until he went to university, it's clear that he doesn't really care about Western born Asians.

At first I felt the same like you about the character, but later I could appreciate some points. While he mocks Asian culture, unlike most other examples, he claims Asian culture is better than western culture. (E.g. 'if your parents also beat you, you wouldn't be a failure', or less offensive 'white people don't know how to cook')"
16,n65j49,"I disagree with a lot of this video.

* How do you reconcile the idea that his humor is intended for the white gaze when he has a huge number of fans that are not only Asian, but living in Asian-majority societies?

* Every example you gave of disparagement humor (except one) was a person of a different ethnic background making fun of Asian people. The study regarding that I mention below.

* The one example you gave was Margaret Cho. If you are casually throwing Margaret Cho in as some example of a comedian that uses disparagement humor you need to support your case (and not just throw up a slide that says ""I hate it"".) Margaret Cho has been on the frontlines of bringing Asian representation to comedy and mass media for longer than most of the people on this reddit have been alive. She has fought (and often lost) this fight for years. She is not self-evidently problematic unless you only want to preach to your particular choir.

* The rubber band slide doesn't really say anything. Humor can both normalize and stigmatize a wide variety of topics and behaviors in our culture. That rubber band has closed and opened innumerable times.

* I don't have access to Tai/Borghella/Sanchez but I'd be interested to know if the jokes were simply transferred from a white speaker to a minority speaker. To do so would ignore a lot of the context provided by having an in-group speaker, not to mention that the content almost always changes. There's a huge difference between a white comedian saying ""I saw an old Korean lady talk about out of body experiences here's what she sounded like"" and ""Here's how my mom sounds when talks about out of body experiences"" even if the next 90 seconds of material is delivered exactly the same way. The abstract of that study even mentions that their conclusion is essentially ""conventional wisdom"" so I'm not sure what insight it's actually meant to provide.

* According to the Plan A article you cite, I guess these works are problematic: The Farewell, Master of None, Fresh Off the Boat, Ken Jeong, Crazy Rich Asians, Joy Luck Club, and William Hung? And I guess the entire era of AZN-Giant Robot culture as well? And then in a few years will we add 88Rising and BTS and Joji and everyone current to this list too? I'd ask two questions: what culture do the folks at Plan A approve of, and is there unexamined ageism in this view?

* There's another possible reason some of us want to make fun of our parents' generation: because in a lot of ways they are assholes, and deserve to be made fun of. And they can be uncomfortable to be around because they don't care about social norms, which makes them jerks sometimes, and hilarious and admirably defiant at other times. It's a mistake to assume I want to make fun of my dad because I want to get in early before a white person makes of him. A white person doesn't even observe or understand the things I want to make fun of my dad for. Russell Peters made fun of Chinese immigrants for bonding with other Chinese people until they found out they didn't come from the same province. That was 100% spot on and not something a white non-immigrant observer would ever understand or ridicule. The Plan A view of comedy and the majority of observations about comedy in this video are extremely reductive and assume that jokes are consistently written with the same approach.

* It might be more useful or persuasive if you contextualized a video like Nigel Ng's or that approach to humor as compared to the evolution of Black comedy. There are thousands of Black comedians throughout a spectrum between ""Step-in' Fetchit"" and Dave Chapelle, between problematic self-hating capitulators and revolutionaries. The problem is a huge part of the material the most progressive Black artists created would fall under this video's definition of ""disparagement humor"". And a lot of those artists moved throughout their career from one part of the spectrum to another. But I don't think anyone would wish that that cultural movement hadn't happened, or argue that it has hurt their cause, or (in what I consider is a highly irresponsible move on your part) has somehow contributed to racism and violence against Black people.

* If you want a certain kind of humor to achieve what you want then you either need to create that content yourself, or point us to people doing the work you like. Comedy is insanely hard and the majority of cultural commentators on topics like these have never attempted it and have no idea about the nuances of creating material like this.

* How is pointing out that an Asian character prefers tofu in a plastic wrapping a problem?

* How is celebrating MSG an example of throwaway racial stereotyping?

* I loved William Hung. Not because he was some vision of what white people thought of us, but because he was an earnest, confident kid that did his best. He sold a t-shirt that said ""I did my best, I have no regrets at all"" which I bought and wore for years. That sentiment is opposed to the ""tiger mom"" idea. He was a lovable guy that tried his hardest at something he loved and was unashamed. He was a hero.

Finally, I delved into that Plan A article by Karen Shibuya and it ends with this:

""If Asian Americans go back to a total lack of mainstream visibility, I am frankly okay with that.""

Fuck that."

18,n65j49,"I have not heard of Uncle Roger/Nigel Ng until now, but I'm 2 min in and already steaming mad."
19,n65j49,I think this was an excellent breakdown of the character. Thanks for sharing
20,n65j49,"I have no problems with the accent if that was someone's authentic accent.  However, I do have a problem with Nigel Ng's fake and exaggerated caricature of this accent.  It's freakin annoying."
21,n65j49,but that's how malaysian chinese people talk? they have that exact accent and they use those phrases and he's malaysian chinese himself. I understand why it's upsetting that white people are finding this funny but the guy didn't set out to make a parody for white people. he's just poking fun at his own culture. The Asian diaspora does not revolve around Asian Americans
22,n65j49,"His view is that of not Asian american (or minority growing up in a different country).  This dude is basically an Uncle Tom tap dancing for established racism while being oblivious. He got attacked and he thinks it's a ""random attack not racially motivated""

https://www.comedy.co.uk/people/news/6031/nigel-ng-attacked/

The fact is, he IS an outsider. That isn't understood by the average American.

Systemic injustice towards Asian Americans is over his head, and Asian Americans are left with trying to explain to fellow Americans why is it not ok this ASIAN GUY can make fun of ASIANS.

Nigel Ng is a shitbag who will capitalize on degrading entire cultures to make his handlers laugh, all while being grateful for the financial scraps they leave on the floor for him."
23,n65j49,At least Margaret Cho and Russell Peters are FUNNY (sometimes)... this guy Uncle Roger just makes me cringe.
24,n65j49,"You all hate the character mainly because you can’t get past the accent. I suspect this is a lot of ABCs who have tried to distance themselves from the accent their whole lives, and hey, as an immigrant I’ve tried to do the same. But the subtext behind this is probably a belief that you’re better than the immigrant with the accent, that you’re better than me. THAT’S performing for white people. You have a character here with an accent roasting the hell out of white people instead of performing subservient bullshit and you hate him because of the way he talks. And if you think the accent is exaggerated I suggest you find a real Chinese immigrant to speak with."

0,mdq0ma,It’s a start. Now they need to actually remove her from the school board. Saying merit based admissions is racist is pretty wild among the other things she’s been saying.
1,mdq0ma,"Not SF but in the East bay. From the first day of kindergarten my kid was being “bullied” by a Black kid. By bullied I mean this kid punched my child on the first day of class and destroyed his property. I talked with the teacher and then with the vice principal. 

This guy told me that I was ignoring my privilege by saying that the school talking with the kid while not actually stopping him from attacking my child wasn’t good enough. They told me this kid had a right to an education and by me insisting they be placed into separate classes, that I was trying to use my privilege to take away his right to an education. 

I asked the VP why this kid’s right to an education was more important than my child’s. I was told, “I’m sorry you feel that way.”  It was only after I threatened to sue the school and him personally did they school move the bully child out of the class. 

Two years later, several Black students threatened to kill my kid as well as other students. School administration again acted like it was no big deal. By this time I was just absolutely done with them. I called the police and had them look into the matter. 

This was just my two pieces of my own admittedly anecdotal evidence, but my experience with school administration has absolutely not been one of protecting Asian students who bully Black students. It was one of school administration calling me privileged and entitled for wanting to protect my kid."
2,mdq0ma,"I was wondering what the racism in question was, and... it's not the usual suspect, but certainly not an unusual one.

Once again, the model minority myth fucks over another idiot. You really have to admire white supremacists hoodwinking everyone in America into thinking we're genuine believers in this shit. 

Also, SF school board is such a fucking joke, but I'm pleasantly surprised they did the right thing here."
3,mdq0ma,Good.
4,mdq0ma,A good victory!
5,mdq0ma,Good.
6,mdq0ma,Not enough. Get her OUT
7,mdq0ma,Good! It’s about time!
8,mdq0ma,"Wait wait wait- as someone who is Asian American, her tweets made a lot of sense to me. They weren’t tweets that targeted AAPI, but rather brought up how there is real anti-blackness in the AAPI dominant school communities she’s a part of and how assimilation and playing up the model minority MYTH won’t protect AAPI. That is a v different thing than the type of Anti-Asian tweets by the EIC at Teen Vogue or other people that is straight up bashing of AAPI people.

How is it a victory for AAPI to remove someone on their board that is pointing out issues in the AAPI community that she has experienced as a Black woman?"
9,mdq0ma,"I read the entire tweet thread. In context, it's not as aggressive or crude as it seems/sounds. She was asking for resources that would make it easier for her to have a dialogue with Asian Americans in her community. I think this is a smear from the (White and Asian) right-wing tbh. 

[https://twitter.com/recallsfboe/status/1372753629573128206](https://twitter.com/recallsfboe/status/1372753629573128206)"
10,mdq0ma,"Eh. I feel like this could have been really instructive conflict to work out together, rather than kicking her off the board. She obviously cares about racial justice - this feels like a missed opportunity to have dialogue and see what would be possible when working together."
0,8punxq,"He's doing something really admirable. There are countless stories of women, especially in Asia, being scammed, paid only a few dollars, or even robbed at gun / knife\-point for their hair. The hair extension and wig industry is booming in the US, where extensions and wigs can cost thousands of dollars and nobody really knows where all the hair comes from. Dan Choi's business is changing that and improving women's lives in the process, with full transparency and fair prices. In stark contrast to the ""white savior"" trope and ""voluntourism"", Choi settled in Ho Chi Minh city and traveled on a motorbike to rural communities to buy and cut women's hair himself. His business now employs 15 local employees.

The woman who sold her hair to Dan in the video had ""long dreamt of being able to raise chickens and ducks on a family farm, but it’s a major financial investment that’s she’s never been able to afford."" She had been offered $3 for her hair by other brokers. Dan paid her about $100 \- ""the equivalent of her entire family’s monthly salary, enough to buy livestock to raise for years to come"" . R29 spoke to other women who had sold their hair to other brokers, and the most they'd been paid was $15.

I sound like a shill, but I promise I'm not affiliated with this company in anyway! It's just a really awesome thing he's doing ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ "
1,8punxq,I love this
2,8punxq,"This is great and I hope he'll eventually be able to pay them even more. I have family members in Myanmar who have sold hair for much less than they should have had to settle for. 

Also, only partly related, my mum told us about how when she first married my father and moved to Australia, she had a super wtf moment. She had almost ankle length hair. My father wanted her to cut it and took her to a hair dresser. The white women there had never heard of Myanmar or met a Burmese person much less someone with hair like that. My mum always describes it as ""they were salivating over it"". She told them she only wanted a few inches off but the hair dresser lopped it off at the elbow then stuffed the ponytail down the pouch in her apron and said ""I'm keeping this!"" Presumably for extensions or a wig. Mum didn't know enough English or have the confidence to say anything about it."
3,8punxq,"Demand outstrips supply within the hair trade? Huh. I had assumed that the price for dark hair was because of abundance. I thought it tends to be bought cheaply from the source also because religious and bleaching preferences. Learning that it's because the industry has such a mercenary attitude towards impoverished women, welp, what else is new. And to be mugged for hair...my impression had been that was for people with rare (expensive) coloration, little did I know. Uhm, should I cut my hair before someone else cuts it for me? I want to get mine appraised but how do I do that without ending up in some sketchy backroom deal...

Anyway, good on Choi for bringing positive change. Hope he's able to stay safe while instigating the kind of disruption this industry needs."

After graduate school, she came out to her family, which was a mostly positive experience. Chan and Katherine Hall met in 1983 and began working together.

2,t6qzqn,The “no fats no fems no Asians” BS from gay men has been discussed in their circles but I do wish that more lesbian/bi women would try to unpack the way they view Asian women because it’s always either weird kpop stan shit (more often than not coming from the type of person who wouldn’t hesitate to start throwing slurs around if an average Asian disagrees with then) or they’re incapable of seeing us as anything but sex toys for men. There’s a big emphasis on not “sleeping with the enemy” that’s always been simmering in lesbian circles but they really turn it up a notch if you’re Asian and look even remotely femme.

0,sgey37,Donald Duk by Frank Chin was assigned every year at my (very white) high school and had a reputation for being a book that sucked and everyone hated. I remember learning its reputation before knowing the book was about Asian American kids. When I read the book I liked it a lot and found it really alienating to be seemingly the only person at my school that enjoyed this book. Coincidentally I was taught this book by a white English teacher who regularly confused me and the other Asian girl in my class. When I asked him why he said it was because our names started with the same letter… even though they did not.
1,sgey37,"**Lawson Fusao Inada** is a third-generation Japanese American (Sansei). Following WW2, Inada became a jazz musician, a bassist. He cites jazz and his time in the internment camps as his main influences as a poet. He studied writing at the Fresno State University, the University of Oregon, and the University of Iowa. In 1994, Inada's Legends from Camp won an American Book Award. Lawson has received several poetry fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts.


**Frank Chin** was one of the pioneers of Asian-American theatre. Early in his career, Frank worked as a story editor and scriptwriter on Sesame Street. He founded the Asian American Theater Workshop, which later became the Asian American Theater Company in 1973, and is currently based in San Francisco. *The Chickencoop Chinaman*, written by Chin, was the first by an Asian American to be produced on a major New York stage. 

**Shawn Wong** has been awarded a National Endowment for the Arts Creative Writing Fellowship and a Rockefeller Foundation residency in Italy. He has taught at the University of Tübingen (Germany), Jean Moulin University (Lyon), and at the University of Washington Rome Center (Italy). He is a pioneer in Asian American studies.



**Jeffery Paul Chan** with his friends Chin, Inada, and Wong, edited two editions of the anthology of Asian American literature, Aiiieeeee! An Anthology of Asian-American Writers, which helped to introduce Asian American authors as worthy of study. They formed the Combined Asian Resources Project (CARP) to achieve this, reintroducing and posthumously republish older works by Asian American authors, such as John Okada's No-No Boy.

I don’t know the restaurant, I’ve never been there, and I don’t know the woman but I’m pretty sure I can guess who her target customers are and what the clientele would look like on any given day."

It's almost like they started a Chinese restaurant just because the husband's first name being Lee would be ""enough to get a pass""."
2,bbp04o,"The entire premise of the restaurant was based on the belief that it wasn't possible to find ""healthy"" Chinese cuisine in New York City.

The same city with multiple Chinatowns spread across its boroughs and well over half a million Chinese and Chinese-American residents.

Of all the places, New York has probably the best selection of Asian American restaurants. I can’t wait for my next visit. It’s gonna feel extra good eating at authentic Chinese restaurants and supporting real ones like Eddie Huang and Danny Bowien."

WWII we talked about Italy because ""someone's gotta talk about the less mentioned wars."" Meanwhile nothing on Africa or the Pacific. Like the author said, they brushed over Asian American history like it wasn't part of American  history.

I don't know if there is a term for it but imo it's ""west (or white people) are the center of the universe"" syndrome. Tbh a lot of people in any given country can be like this but we live in America and this is the most predominant manifestation of this behavior. And this manifests as white privilege here."

The COVID-19 pandemic having originated in China has only made matters worse.

6,ka3jp9,It depends on what kind of videos you watch. I mostly use YouTube to listen to songs from Chinese or Korean dramas and a lot of comments are thirsty ones about how hot the actors are.

8,ka3jp9,"There's no escape from bigotry even in videos where a lot of the comments come from Asians, so I don't expect other people to behave better towards us when we can't even be civil to each other ourselves. 

The final nail in the coffin of my belief in Asian solidarity took place quite recently. I was interested in (G)I-dle for a while, and when I learned that two of their members were voicing characters in K/DA, I went to their newest music video (at the time), ""More"" where they collaborated with a Chinese-speaking artist named Lexie Liu. I finished the video and scrolled down, and there were a lot of really hateful comments written in Korean directed towards her. I remember one comment calling Chinese the ""cockroach language"". The poor girl was just hired to sing a song for an animated character. There were also comments saying that since she sang a portion in Chinese, it was no longer Kpop, even though there were significantly more verses sung in English, and two of the four members of K/Da were voiced by American singers who aren't even Asian. But all the hate was directed at that Chinese girl."

10,ka3jp9,"All you have to do is say ""I love dogs"" and the racist comments start online."
11,ka3jp9,"People like to upload popular music tracks to YT, and sometimes they add random videos or animations for songs that don't have official music videos. 

I remember I saw the song Turning Japanese by the Vapors uploaded to YT. I don't have a problem with the song really. But the uploader added old racist animations that were really bad. Like the WW2 anti ""Jap"" propaganda from Disney, and various other obscure animations that had the stereotypical slant eyed buck tooth characters.

Commenters were calling out the uploader for posting racist shit. But the uploader was denying it all and saying this was the official video from the band. He even put ""official video"" in the title. Sad part is that it had view counts in the 6-digits and no one reported it for 2 years? WTF. I checked recently and it looks like it finally got pulled down.

More to OP's point, I tend to see a lot of racist comments on cooking videos where the host/cook is Asian. It's the usual dog/cat meat jokes and other grade school level trash talking. 

But overall, YT is full of vile stuff and a lot of it goes unnoticed or no one cares because they think it's not a big deal to racist towards Asians."

4,b9eof4,"I love John Cho and I think he'll do great capturing both the emotional aspects of the character as well as any comedic timing. 

That being said, I have mixed feelings. John has definitely earned his shot at a big role like this, but he's also a bit old for the character. And while I'm sure he'll train hard, doing a live-action Spike with a non-martial arts oriented actor feels like a missed opportunity.

Either way, the cast looks great and the people behind the scenes look talented (minus that *Thor: The Dark World* credit). Hope this one breaks the curse of crappy Western adaptations of anime."

13,b9eof4,Spike is so iconic and especially as an animated character has been built up in the minds of fans as the peak of cool for all ages.

white people can't even conceptualize how 400 years of brutal chattel slavery, jim crow, etc impact the lives of black folks today--there's no way they're ever going to understand the subtle but meaningful ways in which this is culturally appropriative. They're just not. They won't even put on masks or get shots to save their own lives, because 'COVID kills other people!'

Speaking for myself, cultural appropriation is taking the surface level of a culture, stripping it of context, meaning, and significance, and engaging with it in an extremely superficial way.

Food I'm gonna let go. What rankles is a lack of equal capital and opportunity so Asians or other minorities can't equally profit ... what rankles is when Lee's says they make clean Chinese food because Chinese food as you know, gives you diarhea and you never know what they put in it. 

If you just say ""culturally appropriate"" it's almost a code word at this point because *this* audience gets what it means, but it means nothing to white people reading it.

On the home page, it says ""inspired by traditional rice congee,"" and as far as I'm concerned, that is enough acknowledgement of where it came from. If someone needs more info on the cultural origins of congee, they can Google it. Nowadays, people use the phrase ""cultural appropriation"" as if there is some cultural patent office to adjudicate to whom a cultural idea belongs. It is one thing to point out disrespectful display of one's culture by others, but you can't ""own"" your culture. All cultures borrow and incorporate ideas from other cultures.  If people are upset she's making money off of her innovation,  they are still free to try to sell their own version for western palates."
0,mvewzb,"One thing that really ticks me off about Asian (and specifically Chinese) stereotypes is this old stereotype dating back to the 19th century about Chinese opium dens.

While it is true that China had an opium drug problem that was later brought to the United States, the complete truth is that the UK facilitated the opium trade during the 18th century. They did this to pay for all of the tea that they were purchasing. Since they were reluctant to pay in cash for their purchases, the ""Honorable"" East India Trading Company began producing opium in India to export to China. 

The public health risk caused by this opiate addiction caused Emperor Jiaqing (of the Qing Dynasty) to ban the trade, importation and cultivation of opium starting in 1796. The East India Trading Company subsequently began smuggling operations. American trading vessels along with merchant ships from other nations were used to ship opium into China.  

When the opium ban failed to work, the Emperor appointed Lin Tse-Hsu to deal with this problem. This commissioner did what he could to curb the growing health crisis. Drug dealers were punished. Addicts were treated. 

On June 3,1839  Lin Tse-Hsu seized and destroyed 1,400 tons of opium. 

The British responded by declaring war against China in 1840. They claimed that the Chinese were obstructing ""free trade."" Sixteen modern British warships subsequently crushed the antiquated Chinese navy and began bombarding costal cities. 

The Treaty of Nanking was signed in 1842. The Chinese were made to pay $21 million in reparations which included the British Royal Navy's cost for fleet operations as well the replacement cost for the 1,400 tons of opium that had been destroyed by the Chinese government.  Hong Kong was ceded to the British for a 99 years. The British also took control of the Kowloon Peninsula. 

While Arabic traders are thought to have first introduced opium to China as early as the 5th century, it was the British who made this readily available as a way of paying for their tea trade."
1,mvewzb,">During the Philippine-American War, which ran from 1899 to 1902, the United States invented waterboarding to torture Filipino guerilla fighters. The U.S. Army also burned villages and rounded up civilians into strategic hamlets, a practice it would later use in Vietnam. 

Philippine-American war, where commanders bragged about having practice from killing Native Americans back home, called Filipinos 'little better than dogs', made orders such as 'kill everyone over the age of ten', resulted in 200,000+ civilian deaths, and of course all while being an unpopular war over Colonialism.

It's no use arguing with these people. Nor should we dress up in red, white, and blue and rebrand China/Korea/Japantown to Americatown, as Andrew Yang seems to want us to do. The pandemic is a good litmus test to figure out who is worth knowing and who should be ignored.

In Asia, people from countries where dog meat, balut, live octopus, and even bat, are all considered delicacies jumped on the ""Chinese eat everything train,"" and used it as an excuse to discriminate against Chinese minorities, tourists, and migrant workers."

Sadly, Asian Americans are caught in the crossfires of this despite probably being more Americanized than Asian.

Whether or not ""bat soup"" happens in China. Probably

Whether or not ""bat soup"" can/did cause the virus. Maybe

How ""bat soup"" is generally being portrayed in the US. Leaning toward discrimination. 

How ""bat soup"" is being used by racists in the US. Justification for dormant or active racism. 

Like anything in this world with this amount of public attention, there will always be people who are going to joke and rumour and misunderstand and take things to an extreme level. Same thing happens with American Idol, even the death threats. Yes, racism has turned its ugly head toward the Asian communities, but I'm not sure if it's the ignorance of racism that I'm most concerned about."
13,fz1a4b,"I feel like there should be a more nuanced view when talking about this.

Yes, there's no proof that bat soup started this pandemic. But even if bat soup isn't a popular cuisine, there's no denying that it's available in the markets along with pangolins. And that some Chinese people do eat them. Just because you don't know anyone that eats it doesn't mean it doesn't happen. I don't think you visit the type of places that would have it. 

Yes there's a growing racism towards Chinese Americans now more than ever, but China isn't without blame with how this pandemic started and how they handled it. America is also handling it terribly."

I think the whole eating bug, insect things are done more for shock factor and to attract tourist.  It's not really common in SEA cultures.

Regarding Rogan I stop listen to him a long time ago when I see that he's just like every other media host when he doesn't push back against his guess.  I'm not talking about controversial figures like Alex Jones or Ben Shapiro.  I stop when he have A list celebrity on and just let them give the same spiel like they did on other show.  Since then I noticed that he doesn't really take ownership of the things he said, and downplay his responsibility in shaping the American public opinions on a multitude of subjects.  I feel like his defense of but I'm just a guy felt short specially when he attract millions of bros.  Joe Rogan is not as progressive or as he let on on the podcast.  On a lot of important topic he fail to do even the basic research make it very tough for me to continue to listen to him.

16,fz1a4b,"I'm Chinese american and I have lived in china for 8 years. IN wuhan's wet market they eat bats on skewers and roast them crisp. It is disgusting. A small nontrivial portion definitely eat them in Hunan province and in  guangdong.. Bats are virus laden and can transfer diseases, though it's rare to make the jump to the human population. Regarding the origins  of this disease i will say Chinese scientists and field workers are known in the scientific community to be sloppy and take shortcuts. One field worker -as has been shown on cctv 14 years ago- didn't cover her arms with PPE when corralling bats in caves. That's an eventual recipe for disaster"

Anyhow, mini-rant (?) over. I ain’t of Chinese descent, but I’ve been made fun of for my Asian features. I am lucky to have a father that taught me to be proud of my cultural heritage.

Stay strong lad/lass. Your Chinese heritage is an integral part of your identity and you should never let these fuckwads take that from you. Much the anti-Chinese sentiments are a manifestation from seeing what the Chinese Communist Party does, and unfortunately many Americans do not explore further than that to see the rich cultural treasures China has to offer.

The shitty situation we got is par for the course when we have terrible leadership and lack of collective values. So, yeah it’s fair that China recovered better cuz they took it seriously. This guy sucks LOL

Have you ever considered living in China for a while? I’m speaking as an ABC who has spent about 3 years in Shanghai, and it’s definitely given me more perspective of my identity for the better.

I feel really ashamed about saying that now-- I was really just repeating this white exceptionalism/supremacy bullshit I think all us Chinese Ams are taught and reinforced to believe growing up. I've been through period of hating being Chinese, and I've figured it out for myself. 

It was a struggle but I've personally really come to terms with being both Chinese and American. I don't condone violence but I'd wanna slap your white guy friend's silly little face and not let him off the hook after hearing him say that about Chinese people. Like white Europeans didn't fuck up the entire global south and build their (declining) civilizations off exploiting masses of people. Don't even fucking talk about ""cheating"" and ""stealing."" To this very day in mainstream news media you can see white countries talk about foreign nations like they're their prizes to be won and collectively turn a blind eye to fellow white/anglo countries' war crimes and hr violations. How about we all collectively start telling the white people we know that cheating and stealing is in their goddamn culture? About Covid, the guy's ignorant as hell and can't wrap his head around the fact that a currently over quarter million people have died from it this year (!!!) whereas China has contained it within its borders.  

However ""liberal"" the guy thinks he is, however he claims to support BLM and feel sad about racism towards us, he 1) doesn't understand that BLM->America places so little value on many, many people's lives, because he is part of the damn problem 2) He isn't as fucking sad as he says he is about the racism we face. 

Please don't be ashamed to be Chinese. Everyone has their faults, but most of us are good, resilient people who always try to be better. If you think what he said was wrong, you can absolutely push back. You can get angry. You can ask him questions to point out how that shit doesn't make sense and tell him it's not okay. You can help us crack down on this ""anti-China shit.""

1,s58roz,"**Stats**

Your statistics link only linked to some articles. It would be more helpful if you link directly with instructions instead of having us sift around. So maybe I need a better source. But this is what I used to look at hate crime statistics:

[https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/pages/explorer/crime/hate-crime](https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/pages/explorer/crime/hate-crime)

I scrolled down to ""Hate Crime in the United States by Bias"" and used the dropdown for anti-asian. Under offender race, there is a 126 by white people and 53 by black people. So yea the majority of the hate crimes in America are by white people and not black people. This much we agree on.

**Why?**

However, this is also a white country. For a lot of crime or anything that is going to happen, there is a huge likelihood that white people are going to be the majority of it when based on flat numbers. Because they are the majority of this country.

When people talk about racism and fear of it, try boiling down to a question of rate. What is the likelihood of an incident happening per encounter with a white person or a black person. Based on the stats, white people have committed a total of anti-asian crimes 237% more than black americans. However there are 475% as many white people as there are black people. So it's about rate. Based on the stats, I am actually safer around a white person than a black person when chosen at random

**Conclusion**

I hate it when people say ""oh white people commit more crimes"". Yea well, they are the majority of this country, so flat numbers are going to obviously show that. Rate is what we really care about.

With that being said, I don't know where you are getting this notion of white people not getting shitted on. I see white people and black people get shitted almost equality by Asians. I don't see our community hyperfocusing on the black community, rather I see OP hyperfocusing on our community's scrutiny of the black community.

Don't get me wrong, I don't think it should stop us from addressing anti-blackness in our community, but for some of us in our community, I think you should consider something. We are saying this is an issue of mental illness. You have to know how that sounds right? It's the same excuse when white people commit crimes. It's more than just mental illness. Even for those who don't commit crimes, you hear about how some subset of the black community talks about us.

I think what we have a good portion of our community that tries to mend relationships with the black community and vice-versa. And that is good. But what that group doesn't do is talk about the uncomfortable stuff. It doesn't feel like we have a seat at the table when we talk about social justice issues. It's more like we have a seat in the room, but like 5 feet from the table"

There is so much racist comments/narratives being pushed on reddit. Any opportunity to push tension between asian/black people will be upvoted on reddit. They will use this excuse to post racist narratives about black people and why asians should hate them (alongside with why white people aren't so bad). Same thing happens often with affirmative action. [Source](https://www.vox.com/22321234/black-asian-american-tensions-solidarity-history)"
4,s58roz,"just wanted to say that the article claiming that most perpetrators are white is extremely misleading- first their research was based on something like 1000 news articles; actual FBI statistics on crime tell a very different story about the demographics. Secondly, their research included verbal assaults as a hate crime, which it technically is, but we can agree this isn’t the same as a violent assault. That article smacks of deliberate agenda to shift the focus back on white supremacy- which I agree is the bigger issue, but this shouldn’t be done by sweeping other realities under the rug.

I agree that we shouldn’t extend the actions of the mentally ill to the entire black community, this guy was clearly mentally ill- but he was also likely racially motivated.  I would also like to see black spaces (eg Black Twitter) have earnest discussions about anti-asianism, much like how asian spaces (reddit, FB groups, etc)are very much having some very serious discussions about anti blackness. And at the risk of playing oppression Olympics,  the latter just doesn’t  result in violent assaults/lives lost as much as the former - I say this only to highlight the relative urgencies (of course I believe all forms of racism are deplorable)"
5,s58roz,"I don't think blaming the whole community from the actions of a mentally ill person is justified. At the same time, black people could do a better job telling their people to leave Asians alone. It's baffling that we see more 'check your anti-blackness' from Asian people to Asian people during the last two years rather than Asians and Black people telling 'anti-asianess' towards everyone."

9,s58roz,"Your mention of Seung-Hui Cho reminded me of some lyrics from Donald Glover's song Backpackers

>[ Something crazy, an Asian, Virginia Tech](https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/childishgambino/backpackers.html)

Not the first time a black artist would promote anti-Asian racism in their song lyrics. Probably not the last either."
10,s58roz,"I'm Black and I won't lie- the amount of Asian neighbors I've come across recently who outright seem frightened of me hurts. I understand why. I've lived in my neighborhood almost 20 years and I'm still sure one wrong move would lead my White neighbors at least to call the police on me or claim I was up to no good. Not sure why, but it hurts more when that level of suspicion comes from AA. But also. I understand how it feels to never truly feel safe in your own neighborhood even if it's a safe one.

What makes me nervous is this idea that Black people as a whole can't be trusted or are dangerous. It feels like these attacks and deaths are, at least on reddit/online used to enforce the idea that Black people are out there and out to get you. So of course it's justified to fear us, lock us up, keep away.

And I'm not saying that Anti-Asian sentiments don't exist in Black communities, but even if the news doesn't scream ""Black people are out to get you"" there's a subtle way to do that and I think that's what happening. And it makes me uncomfortable. Still, it would be inappropriate, incorrect, and rude af to say there was nothing to fear either"

13,s58roz,"u/tripostrophe, you linked a source from a report by the group Virulent Hate saying the overwhelming majority of perpetrators are white. I've seen NBC Asian America and other Asian journalists use this same source in articles as well. But that report is total BS. 

Has anyone actually read that report? [You can read it here](https://virulenthate.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Virulent-Hate-Anti-Asian-Racism-In-2020-5.17.21.pdf).

First and foremost, the **report doesn't even look at crime or conviction statistics**, it looks at ""4,337 news articles that addressed the topic of coronavirus-related, anti-Asian racism in the United States"" (3). 

Second, the **report only counts news articles where the race/ethnicity of the offender is explicitly identified.** So out of 4,337 articles, the report admits that ""Only a small fraction of news articles explicitly identified the race of the individuals who harassed or discriminated against Asian and Asian American people"" (2). **In fact, the report says that they found 184 incidents in which the race of the source was identified, of which 127 of those incidents were stigmatizing statements and actions by politicians** (14). You don't have to be a statistics major to know that this is not how representative sampling works. 

This report is incredibly misleading because when we think about Asian Hate, we're mainly thinking about incidents in the everyday lives of Asians where we're getting senselessly assaulted, harassed, murdered SIMPLY for existing. And while the idiotic statements by Trump and his cohorts are harmful, it's disingenuous to count them in a report about physical and verbal assaults against Asians. 

I'm not saying that Black people make up the majority of incidents against Asians. I don't even believe that's true. But there seems to be a concerted effort by the Asian activist groups like Virulent Hate and the writers for NBC Asian America to pass the buck to white supremacy whenever an Asian person is assaulted by a nonwhite perpetrator.

If the situations were reversed, you bet your ass those Asian activists would be writing articles and tweeting about anti-blackness in the Asian community without a second thought."
14,s58roz,">We've seen the statistics, which show that the overwhelming majority of perpetrators are white

Do remember that in the US, whites far outnumber Blacks. When you consider the *incident rates* as opposed to the *absolute numbers,* you might arrive at different pictures, especially when the more serious physical harassments are concerned.

\- There are \~[250 million](https://www.statista.com/statistics/183489/population-of-the-us-by-ethnicity-since-2000/) whites in 2020 and [12 recorded Anti-Asian physical harassments ](https://virulenthate.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Virulent-Hate-Anti-Asian-Racism-In-2020-5.17.21.pdf) perpetrated by whites in the same year (\~1 incident per 21 million whites).

\-  There are \~40 million blacks and 3 recorded Anti-Asian physical harassments perpetrated by blacks in the same year (\~1 incident per 13 million blacks)."
15,s58roz,[removed]
16,s58roz,"The problem with any of this is that an ethnicity does not and cannot be expected to police members of their group. They do not know these perpetrators personally, they do not associate with their behavior, and they may not have the means to change things so directly. Instead, ask the community as a whole—local or county government—to tackle the issue of a rise in hate crimes. People aren’t going to defend hate crimes and will help out, but they won’t help you if you’re laying blame on or asking for actions from their specific ethnicity."
17,s58roz,[removed]
18,s58roz,"Couldn't have said it better myself.

There's racism between the asian and black community for sure (on both sides, toward the other), but with the way that black on asian crime is presented, even promoted, in the news, I can't help but notice how it seems only to serve to spur fear and animosity between us. It should be obvious, yet isn't, that furthering the wedge between two minority communities is exactly the sort of thing that only serves to benefit the status quo (white supremacy).

Another thing is, while I certainly am not making excuses for Michelle or anyone's attacker—obviously he did what he did, it is inexcusable, and a life was tragically lost, with many forever changed—I think it's also worth noting that there's also a high prevalence of homelessness (and thus mental illness) among the black population due to the systematic racism/inequality that exists in our country. I've observed some people feeling entitled to use these kind of attacks to fear monger about those black ""crazy"" homeless guys that are \~seemingly everywhere\~, without stopping to wonder why that is."
19,s58roz,"The individual should be held responsible and be given the necessary penalty for their actions. 
No “we don’t wanna put another black man/woman in jail” bs. 

As far as the tension between black and Asian American communities, it’s fueled by twisted dynamics. 
White america as the narcissistic parent,
Asian America as the golden child,
Everyone else (black, brown, etc.) as the scapegoat child. 
I’m not putting pity on anyone but the dynamics are so similar to a toxic narcissistic environment from what I can see.
The parent doesn’t care as long as there’s tension between the two children and won’t come to the defense of the Asian American. 
And they’ll use whatever opportunity to make them look good. I have met an overwhelming amount of white BLM supporters who don’t have the same effort/dedication for Asian Americans. 
So many dismiss or disregard the hate crimes terrorizing and murdering our community. Can we talk about gaslighting? 

I’m honestly thinking of deleting my Reddit account altogether. It makes me sick just to think it’s another Facebook providing a platform for racist, sexist rhetoric."
20,s58roz,"Mental illness affects everyone. Addressing mental illness cost money. Historically, the black community has been underserved with social services compared to other areas since not a lot of money was allocated to those neighborhoods.

This is tragic but I don't think there was any major public perception of blacks vs asians. It was more of what to do with the mentally ill in public places. If anyone is jumping to conclusions that a race war is about to come, you should educate yourself...

I also don't come here too often and haven't seen many posts bashing on blacks but rather post that encourages cooperation as opposed to OPs observations on the ""hyperfixation on blacks"""

26,s58roz,"If we want the attacks to go down we have to do the following:

1. Vote for politicians willing to pass bills like BBB - this will improve lives for all including disfranchised and homeless black people

2. destigmatize mental illness and properly fund mental institutions

3. better outreach and opportunities for troubled youth, ending the violent cycle

4. Addressing societal woes that black people are experiencing day to day. How they are perceived, treated, ignored. Etc etc."
27,s58roz,"It is true that recent media coverage on black on asian crime made me worried some(mostly for my elderly mother), but I still feel I'm better off with black neighbors than whites who wave their thin blue line flags."
28,s58roz,[removed]
29,s58roz,"I dont think the problem has anything to do with black culture or people as a whole

Most of the attacks seem to be happening in specific cities like NYC and LA.

There are many places across the midwest and south where there are asian hotspots and plenty of black people, but not that many attacks

That makes me believe theres some dynamic going on in those particular cities. For example, tensions between the black and asian communities have built up for decades in LA, if we think back to the rodney king riots and the roof koreans

That being said, i dont like how we're just defaulting to blaming white people instead.

> We've seen the statistics, which show that the overwhelming majority of perpetrators are white, and yet I never see the same level of calls for accountability from white America

Adjusted for population, white people are actually underrepresented in the statistics.

It seems like whenever people call out racists blaming black people, their next sentence is to default to hating on white people, cause it's more popular to scapegoat them.

Id rather people use critical thinking skills and stop doing either"

31,s58roz,The best thing that can happen for bigoted white supremacists is for minorities to be at each others throats. It is a classic divide and conquer and pit your enemies against each other tactic. We can and should do better for each other.
32,s58roz,"This is why I don’t trust news outlets like Nextshark who are supposedly “on our side.” If you notice, their latest post on instagram about this horrific tragedy had many quotes from CeFaan Kim on Twitter. Almost every one mentioned that “the suspect is homeless” or “he is homeless.” As if there’s some kind of war between Asians and homeless people, and this is our call to arms to beat up homeless people, or cheer on institutional violence that keeps people homeless, as if encouraging the man to get arrested and end up going through the same system that will make it hard for him to get a job and make a living and keep him homeless will bring her back. There was another post about the same day that talked about a Korean man covering a homeless man in his coat and the homeless man attacking him, and if you look in the comments all the commenters are calling for homeless peoples’ blood. It’s absolutely pitiful how even we perpetuate some kind of fucked-up superiority complex against homeless people and black people, as if we aren’t just a step away from becoming just as hated or, even in the case of homeless people, one of them ourselves."
33,s58roz,"For this specific case, its the police and legal system didn't do its job. If he's mentally ill and had criminal records, he should be kept in a mental institution, not roaming on the street.

On the same time we cant deny the racism coming from other POC community, although in this case it's not that"
34,s58roz,"Thank you for this! Encouraging anti-blackness just further upholds white supremacy, when both the black and Asian community want to dismantle it. I remember when I was speaking about the anti-Asian hate crimes that were rampant last year saying how I feared my family’s safety, I had people trying to pin it on the black community and I made sure they knew that it’s harmful to do so."
35,s58roz,[removed]
36,s58roz,"I agree. But in that same light, I hope you’re seeing it the same way for the white person (or any ethnicity for that matter) when a crime is committed against someone in our ethnic group. 

I personally do not judge the entirety of a group based on the actions of a few. Given the group is defined by something they cannot change (like ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation…). Even then, I tend not to judge everyone by what group they choose to belong to from the actions of their peers.

I’m only saying this because I have to many friends who are blind to their own racism towards white people. had this been a white person, the first accusation would have been white supremacy or racism. Even if there was nothing to back up their claims. Even if the white person did not benefit from systematic racism. There definitely are going to be other Asians that will focus on the perpetrator being black, but I also feel you and many others focus way too much on white supremacy even if that isn’t a causing factor in every case."

Asian Americans don’t really have those pressing issues to rally around and so I don’t really feel a need to be represented at extremely high levels of his cabinet.

Edit: What I mean is that we don’t have the Zeitgeist behind us that speaks to a need for high level cabinet positions. Like are Asian issues so pressing that we need an Asian Attorney General? Head of Homeland Security? Head of Treasury? Aside from having an Asian already in the vice presidency?"

3,fqdh41,"TODAY: A push by the US State Department to include the phrase ""Wuhan virus"" in a joint statement with other Group of Seven members following a meeting of foreign ministers on coronavirus on Wednesday was rejected, resulting in separate statements and division in the group.

""What the State Department has suggested is a red line,"" a European diplomat said. ""You cannot agree with this branding of this virus and trying to communicate this.""

The proposed draft statement by the United States also blamed China for the pandemic's spread, the diplomat told CNN.

Although the World Health Organization officially has dubbed the illness Covid-19 or coronavirus, a 12-paragraph draft statement circulated by the US among the G7 ministers referred to it as the ""Wuhan virus."" Because the US holds the presidency for the international coalition -- which also includes the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Canada -- it was responsible for penning the draft joint statement.

As a result, several of the member nations released their own statements following the foreign ministers' meeting, which was [held virtually](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/11/politics/g7-foreign-ministers-meeting-virtual/index.html) due to the coronavirus pandemic.

A French statement about the meeting referred to the ""COVID-19 pandemic."" And in a sign that the loaded term isn't a priority for all members of the Trump administration, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin signed on to a G7 finance ministers' statement that they were enhancing coordination ""to respond to the global health, economic, and financial impacts associated with the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).""

That said, a two year old's language ability is normally limited to general comprehension and rudimentary expression. They're not having conversations.  Also, I wonder if the children of immigrants do actually learn two languages or not by the age of two. Presumably they are spending most of their time at home being exposed to only the language their parents are speaking. Unless their parents make a deliberate effort to speak two languages then the child will favour the language of the parents until it starts interacting with other kids at playgroups or kindergarten. I question how much interaction Random White American Twitter User has had with two year old children of immigrants.

Princess Charlotte has a Spanish nanny, so that's why she is learning Spanish. It's no different to having a bilingual parent from her perspective. She is not taking classes or anything like that."

I am a fluent Mandarin Chinese speaker (Taiwanese accent) and I have never put a pause between 'nei' and 'ga', nor have I ever pronounced it 'na ge'.

There is a lot of context given, and it's all as clear as day. Those MBA students must be some of the dumbest motherfuckers on the planet if they can't parse the meaning of these VERY simple statements. 

Russell Peters did a standup set for Def Comedy Jam a while back where he joked about a request to ""pass the vinegar"" as secret racism - and as ridiculous as that sounds, at least it's in the same language. I never thought we would be in a world where I could potentially be accosted for speaking Chinese because a phrase I say in Chinese sounds like something bad in English, a language that I *wasn't even speaking*. Just typing that sentence made my eye twitch with the sheer stupidity required to formulate that thought."
9,imm4bs,This is so fucking stupid. Can't the university see that there was no malicious intent?
10,imm4bs,Omg no. My family and I giggle about how it sounds but it’s obviously not being used in the same way as the n word. This is ridiculous
11,imm4bs,"I definitely say nei-ge or nuh-ge, not na-ge"
12,imm4bs,"so often i feel like there's a very english/US-centric approach when it comes to listening to other languages.... like people who see ""negro"" on a makeup bottle and don't realize it's surrounded by spanish words and it's the translation for black. or listen to a korean song and right away assume they're saying an english slur though the rest of the song is korean (and then censor it on the radio). or this.

it's important to have sensitivity to it because it is an understandably triggering word (like how BTS changed their lyrics to avoid this at billboard), but when it comes to linguistics studies i feel like you have to come from a place of understanding a separate culture and removing assumptions from the US/wherever your own culture is based. the professor could have prefaced it with an explanation though, kinda surprised if he hasn't heard this concern before?

(disclaimer: ofc racial slurs are absolutely wrong and asian people who say it and then say ""well i was saying the korean/chinese/etc word for I/that/etc!!"" as an excuse is messed up to say the least. also i connected spanish & korean just bc that's my background)"

25,imm4bs,"I've worked with a lot of Chinese families, so I have heard this phrase. That said, it has crossed my mind that it sounds like an American slur. I would say that the professor should have been a little more aware, but perhaps that's an example of how white privilege affects your thinking. Either it really never crossed his mind because that slur isn't in his face ever or he did think about it once maybe but he thought no one could possibly think that of him since he's so not racist.

To be clear, I don't think this was the right response. A university like USC must have a Chinese Language department. Why not talk to them and ask their opinion? Or at least mediate a (virtual) meeting with the Black students and the professor so they understand where each side is coming from. It's not fair to take a stance where essentially you're communicating that you consider a word in another language, that has nothing to do with the slur, racist."
26,imm4bs,"I’ll be honest, the professor comes across like a dick in his response. You’re telling me you’ve been using this example for years and never once realized it sounds like a slur? If that’s the truth, then that’s definitely some white privilege.

I still 100% agree that this should have no bearing on how the word is used by Chinese speakers, and I don’t think the professor should be disciplined further. But he hopefully can learn to at least use a disclaimer next time."
27,imm4bs,"My first reaction to this was worry that this would restrict speaking Mandarin words in public. As a native Mandarin speaker, I think his pronunciation is correct so it's not fair to blame him for pronouncing it wrong or making it intentional. However, we need to consider that this was a communication class that is taught in English. The example using Chinese was randomly inserted and he was still speaking in English for the most part. For someone who doesn't speak Chinese, it does sound like the n-word which can be alarming in the context of an English taught class. Even for bilingual people, sometimes you might be ""thinking"" of a word in a different language based on what is spoken in context.

In this context, it seems like the black students are calling out this white professor's insensitivity when using the word and not the actual word itself. Notice they aren't saying the word itself is bad and unacceptable to use. I don't think this is as much an attack on using the language, but rather how this white professor didn't think this through, especially when he seems to be a native English speaker. Most Asian Americans notice how this word sounds growing up, so an English-speaking professor should have, especially since it's something learned and not from speaking natively. 

I think this article further divides the black and asian community. It makes Asian Americans feel like the black students don't deserve to be affected by this. The black students definitely deserve to feel how they feel and hopefully this experience helps the professor think about issues like this more often, especially considering he is a communications professor. I think as Asian Americans, it's important to recognize when other minorities feel attacked and try to understand things from their point of view so minorities aren't pitted against each other. 

Also the professor didn't apologize and gave bullshit excuses imo. It's not too hard to admit you were careless and apologize."
28,imm4bs,"Most Chinese speakers in the US are aware of how these words can sound if mispronounced. As young as age 12, I remember having conversations with my ABC friends about being mindful, especially in a public place like Disneyland, where you could inadvertently adversely impact someone.

I think most Chinese speaking Asian Americans are also aware that when you speak Chinese, other people are uncomfortable.  We get yelled at to speak English and monolingual speakers are always suspicious that we are talking shit about them. In a way, I was not at all surprised to find that the professor was white.  Even if he wasn't trolling, he wasn't being vigilant like we have to be.

The proper pronunciation for 那個 or 哪一個 is ""nah"" ge or ""nah yi"" ge anyway, so most Chinese speakers in the US seem to stick to that."
29,imm4bs,"Seems overly cautious, but may be a good thing in the end for both the professor and students to understand cultural and dialect differences in pronunciation...    If you choose to look hard enough, you'll usually find something to be upset about 🤷🏾‍♂️"
30,imm4bs,"High key about to go ham on this article since I thought they were placing a Chinese professor on leave for coincidently just saying that in class during a lecture. But damn, you gotta learn how to pronounce things before saying them.

Edit: I was taught a different pronunciation, so I didn’t know that was a way to pronounce it. I will say that if you didn’t know Chinese, you probably would also do a double take."

Prior to the pandemic this may have been a less aggressive question. Hell, I’ve noticed (prior to pandemic) that at most nail salons I go to, workers would ask if I’m Chinese or Korean or Vietnamese.

Now there’s a fear every time the question is asked by a non-Asian, even when I’m at work and it’s a patient asking (at least once a week). It’s because the answer is Chinese, and if I answer that, would I be attacked by the people who are barely willing to keep a mask on around other patients? In a city where they tell our (Taiwanese) mayor to go back to China? Last week, a patient’s first words to me were “Are you from Singapore?” Later “Are you from Philippines?” As he was leaving “You didn’t tell me what country you are from!” This was a man with a strong accent, clearly not from the U.S. During the pandemic I realized I can’t see only white Americans as dangerous, people of color and immigrants are dangerous too, because no matter where we are in the world we will always be considered foreigners."

20,rmd4lu,"There is definitely an undercurrent of anti-Chinese racism with the new Cold War with China. But at the same time, we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that Xi Jinping is a dangerous dictator who has reversed a lot of the press freedoms, rule of law and economic freedoms in China, and is actively persecuting minorities within China- a reversal of all previous Chinese communist policies.

In other words, the Cold War against China is right and necessary. The Cold War against Asian Americans is what we need to resolutely reject."

Behind every racist is a dozen other people either extremely comfortable and happy with their racism and leaving things as is, or silently (or not so silently) racist as well, crying out this kind of bullshit.

Vitriolic, violent racists are one problem, and a serious one. Those people are the ones enabling and supporting said racists, and honestly are in some senses worse and a billion times more hypocritical."

1. White person gets angry = Leadership skills
2. Asian person gets angry = Asshole/Troublemaker

4. Middle Eastern or someone who LOOKS Middle Eastern (Israelis/Armenians/Indians/Sikhs) gets angry = report them to the FBI

“Walking away does not solve the issue and that is why I am choosing to speak up.”

That's for sure. Walking away has never worked. I love my late dad, but one of the things from my childhood that still sticks with me is this one time when were at the neighborhood park and this racist White fuck of a kid was calling me every anti-Asian racist slur in the book, some I hadn't even known of. My dad refused to respond; worse, he refused to let *me* respond. I still remember him holding me back and telling me not to say anything. Didn't.Help.A.Bit. This was in the '70s."

""The guest left within 4 minutes.  The girls who was hugged is Asian and was unaware of the incident.  You don't have all the information and clearly don't understand that we value our employees and guests safety.  We did not want to elevate it where this potentially volatile situation could've created a racist incident with 13 African-American people sitting at the table next to Sophia as well as the guy going out to his car and getting a gun if he had one.""

So rather than mitigate an actually perceived threat and protect the victims of actual racism, they chose actions based on something that has never happened while leaving the victims completely unattended?  Piece of shits Bluewater Grill are."

2,ikkd1v,"A guy in my city threw a party, got fined by the police and evicted from his apartment 

I can't see remorse is real if she posted a clip saying that those who would social distance wouldn't have been invited."

If you were dumb enough to film yourself flagrantly behaving like a moron during the pandemic, after many other morons had received public backlash for doing the same thing, maybe you should be expelled."
4,ikkd1v,"Just to provide some context, my Big-Ten university has placed 228 students (presumably mostly white) on interim suspension (the first step in an actual suspension) for doing similar things as Jessica Zhang.

Expulsion would be a little harsh, but it would be reasonable to suspend her either a semester, or a year, for her actions."

Whatever punishment she receives is justified, IMO."
14,ikkd1v,She apparently stated that everyone at the party had tested negative right before. Riiiight. So you're telling me that every single person there agreed to get tested right before the party?

I really doubt this couple will provide the proper financial structuring that guarantees a standard of living.

They do a pretty thorough vetting of the would-be adoptive parents in order to ensure, as much as, possible, that the child's bests interests are fulfilled. As such, that would be inconsistent with any notion that they'd withheld vital health information. In terms of Asian Americans seeking to adopt a child from China, they even try to match the physical traits with those of both parents such that I unaware that my cousin's adopted daughter was adopted when I first met her, since she had resemblances to both the mom and dad.

I used to believe in solidarity, and the idealist in me still does - but I cannot grin and take in this shit for much longer.

Edit - I want to elaborate on the black community’s opportunity to help us out here: it’s more than just retweeting a Dion Lim post about an anti-Asian attack, if you really want to effectively call out Asian hate, you need to correct your buddies and friends every time they say something stereotypical about Asians that you feel isn’t true. I genuinely believed in solidarity because both Black & Asian communities, if mobilized and cohesively coordinated, could probably be the leading source of policy generation for policies that help marginalized folks in both our communities.

0,lf00u6,"Welcoming Lunar New Year / Year of the Ox with Chinese Radish Cake (lo bak go/luo bo gao)!

Lunar New Year is just around the corner, and we're about to welcome the Year of the Ox! One of the dishes we always enjoyed at home growing up around Chinese New Year was my grandma's delicious homemade Chinese radish cake, also known as turnip cake/lo bak go/luo bo gao/dim sum radish cake!

While this is a popular and ubiquitous dish on dim sum/yum cha carts around the globe, it's also an auspicious dish to eat around the Lunar New Year period because the word ""cake"" in Chinese is a homonym for ""high/tall,"" meaning that if you eat this in the new year, you will have a high, prosperous new year!

The best Chinese radish cakes are stuffed to the brim with grated radish (duh), Chinese bacon, scallops, shrimp, and shiitake mushrooms, then steamed, and finally sliced thick and pan-fried to golden, crispy perfection. My biggest gripe when getting Chinese radish cake at restaurants during dim sum feasts is that there's rarely enough radish or delicious fillings in them. But you can control all of that when you make it yourself!

To watch my step-by-step video on how to make this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi2ySRE4Zq4&t=47s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi2ySRE4Zq4&t=47s)

**Chinese Turnip Cake Recipe**  


* 2 lb Chinese turnip/radish/daikon, grated (yield: about 5 C); (reserve 1 C cooking liquid)
* 1 C finely minced Chinese bacon or sausage
* 4 dried Chinese scallops, shredded; rehydrated in 1/4 C water, soaking liquid reserved
* 1/4 C (scant) dried shrimp, finely minced; rehydrated in 1/4 C water, soaking liquid reserved
* 8-9 dried shiitake mushrooms, minced; rehydrated in 1/2 C water, soaking liquid reserved
* 2 scallions, roughly chopped
* 2 C rice flour
* 1.5 tsp kosher salt
* 1/2 tsp white pepper
* 1 tsp sugar
* 2 tsp shaoxing wine 
* Neutral oil (for pan frying slices) 

1. **Prepare Chinese bacon:** cut into a few large pieces and steam over medium heat until cooked through. Cool throughly. Remove the fat layer and mince finely. Set aside. 
2. **Prepare scallops, dried shrimp, and mushrooms:** soak the scallops in 1/4 C water, the shrimp in 1/4 C water, and the mushrooms in 1/4 C water to rehydrate. This should take a few hours. Once rehydrated, reserve the soaking liquids for each. Then, finely mince mushrooms and shrimp. For the scallops, shred with your fingers into thread-like pieces. 
3. **Prepare Chinese turnip:** wash, peel, and grate the turnip. After grating, you should have between 4.5-5.5 C turnip. Add this to a pot with 4 C water; bring to a boil over medium heat and simmer for 30 min. Drain this, reserving 1 C cooking liquid. Set aside. 
4. **Prepare turnip filling:** Add bacon to a large pot over medium heat; stir fry until sizzling and fragrant. Then, add the scallops, shrimp, and mushrooms, and stir fry until slightly browned. Finally, add in the scallions and shaoxing wine, stir fry for another minute or two, and remove from heat.
5. **Prepare rice flour base and create cake mixture**: Add rice flour, all soaking liquids, the turnip cooking liquid, plus the salt, pepper, and sugar to a mixing bowl and mix until fully incorporated. Then, add this mixture to the pot with the radish mixture; mix until fully combined. Then, add this mixture into a greased 8-9in cake pan. If using a springform pan, line with foil to prevent leakage or water from getting in.
6. **Steam cake:** Prepare steamer and allow to come to a boil. Add cake to steamer, and steam for 1 hour, replenishing water when necessary.
7. **Cool, slice, and pan fry:** Fully cool cake for at min 5 hours, or ideally overnight in fridge. Cut the cake into slices Chinese style (see video for guide). Pan fry with neutral oil on both sides. Garnish with scallions or cilantro (optional)."

0,i4camf,Came here to relate an opposite situation.  I'm Asian American and I adopted a white son.  This came about because I was a volunteer for our county's social services department and my supervisor asked me to be a temporary foster parent to a boy who was kicked out of his home by his parents because he was 'uncontrollable'.  I did so and we got along so well and he would invite all his friends over to our home to hang out.  He told me that a couple of his buddies told him that he was so lucky to have a dad like me and they wished their dads were like me. He asked me to adopt him so that we could be a real family.  I did so with his natural parents' blessings..   Here it is 50+ years later and in my retirement I thought about moving into a retirement home as I had a little difficulty getting around.  My son insisted that I move in with his family (married with 3 kids all White).  His wife and kids  were enthusiastic about me moving in with them.  So I did it.  It's been a few years and all his kids have gotten married and moved into their own homes.  I still live with my son and he takes good care of me seeing that I keep doctor's appointments etc.  I just wanted to post this here to show that a mixed race family can live together with mutual love and care.

2,i4camf,"I think the misconceptions she talks about stems from portrayals of white parents in the media and specifically, television shows. I don’t know about you guys but my dad never played catch with me or had a heart to heart talk about girls and so we latched onto those portrayals we saw on TV."
3,i4camf,"I had a terrible relationship with my parents, but holy shit did a lot of my white friends have messed up parents as well. Like hoarders (including animal hoarding) with no sheets on mattresses, dog urine everywhere, holes in the drywall, cans of soda stacked to the ceiling. I had a Mormon friend who was basically taught that she should go to college to get a husband and the girls are just supposed to pump out as many kids as possible, her parents barely talked to her because she had 6 brothers and sisters and she had to share the unfinished basement with her younger brother. My friend's mom abandoned him and his brothers to start a ""new life"". She didn't even move anywhere. She just kept going to the same job, same places in town where they run into each other. She just acts like she doesn't have kids any more.  Another of my friend's parents divorced and remarried THREE TIMES. In between divorcing and remarrying, the dad got married to two different women and had two other side families. They are divorced now again!"
4,i4camf,"Yea but when you have Japanese,
Korean and like viet kids who come from diff asian cultures but are able to bond over being beaten. There was a YouTube skit  back in the day all the asian kids in my area loved.
It was about what happened when an asian kid gets a B + on the report card. Skit had the iconic line “we Asians don’t do time out, we do knock out” 

When asian kids in American can relate to memes about asian parents form asian austrialian kids. There’s something there. This shit don’t come from out of nowhere.

Asian parent stories exists for a reason. We have similar traumas despite being from diff asian cultures or even western countries for a reason.

In college and HS, I was blown away by how white kids talk to their parents and vice versa. They talk to each other like equals or even friends. Non of my asian friends with immigrant rents have
That exp. 

Saying it’s personal not cultural when it comes to asian parent abuse is a HUGE fucking cop out in my opinion. A big part of asian meme culture is using comedy to cope with our parental trauma. And there are so many similar threads and elements in  many of our stories. It’s clearly not a case by case basis of one individual parent sucking."
5,i4camf,"I had no idea that this was a thing?  I always assumed we liked our parents more, and that's part of why we stick around, live near them, and help take care of them later on.  (At least, more so than white people).

Which I also tied to why Asians took COVID more seriously.  When white people were like, ""COVID only kills old people!""  I was like... uhhh, do none of you ever see your parents or grandparents at all?"

7,i4camf,[Reply](https://twitter.com/tingkun55/status/1290826332520083456) to original tweet that further explains it!
8,i4camf,"Honestly, I grew up with both an abusive parent and one that wasn’t, so I think the real issue deals with how we can spot and understand child abuse. I don’t think it’s abusive to push your kid to do good in school and encourage good grades a reward and celebrate success, but when your dad has repeatedly ask you about how classes are going and when you’ll be applying for med school and pressuring you to change schools and major and degree and tell his friends that you kid got into a med school and I have to correct that and then you get punished for it is emotional abuse and we should talk about it.

The tweet was recognizing that a majority of Asian Americans don’t experience abuse and the fact that a narrative exist around Asian Americans being abusive to their children and even accepted as “culture” is ridiculous. Like, it so detrimental to actually abused and neglected children. Like one of my closet friends, her mom doesn’t really have a care about her and prioritize her brother. When they go out and eat, she won’t be in any photos and sometimes just not invited. That’s abusive and normalizing and creating a narrative that it’s part of Asian culture will make it so these kids aren’t helped.

It’s like the narrative of normal teenagers with no abusive parents saying they hated their parents just to say it and other abused teenagers internalize that to mean nobody likes their parents, it’s normal. It’s deconstructing these narratives in order to make progress on eliminating abuse."
9,i4camf,"While I don’t necessarily disagree with this tweet in itself, I dislike the message that it’s sending.

I think there are real issues with the way *some* Asian parents raise their kids, and I can’t help but to feel that the recent push I see in towards emphasizing understanding/respecting Asian parents and/or ‘culture’ is pushing these issues aside.

I don’t follow r/AsianParentStories closely, but having perused it at times, there are definitely some cases of egregious abuse on there. Check [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/8zrx7v/my_asian_mom_constantly_abuses_me_and_i_feel_like/), [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/aidyqg/i_dont_see_the_point_in_going_on/), [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/8ywe7p/i_think_my_asian_mom_just_broke_my_jaw/) for some reference. (Of course, it’s important to remember that the large majority of Asian parents are good, and in many cases not much different than Western parents).

But knowing that there’s cases like these, I’m not a fan of pushing these cases aside in the name of ‘understanding parents’ or ‘respecting culture’ or whatever.

That said, I also don’t think we should or need to be critical of Asian parents as individuals, or criticize 'Asian culture' in general, because from what I see, stuff like “tiger parenting” arises mainly because of broader structural and economic factors.

Factors such as selective immigration (programs like H-1B bringing in immigrants with a very technical/academic-oriented mindset), capitalist values, and the [cultural/generational gaps](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/43kgzn/the-hidden-stress-of-growing-up-a-child-of-immigrants-v26n3) in parenting that result from immigration (“*Children of immigrants deal with a generational and* *cultural gap. And this gap is exacerbated by distance and time: Immigrant parents may have a more conservative view of their culture than the people currently living in their country of origin do. “If they came 30 years ago, then the culture is 30 years old”*. There’s also studies that show that parents in China are less strict/more open than their U.S. counterparts, for instance).

So imo, when talking about this issue, we don’t need to point the finger at any individuals, or ‘Asian culture’. We can look to the structural and economic factors that contribute in some cases, to problematic parenting."
10,i4camf,Great point. We always had jokes growing up that our parents were “acting white” if they did anything lenient
11,i4camf,[deleted]
12,i4camf,"From my personal experience, Asian parents are definitely not as kind or nurturing as other races. I can't remember my parents ever kissing, and maybe can recall a handful of times they hugged. This is true for other Asian parents that I've seen. The opposite is true for the non Asian parents that I've seen. 

I'm glad that media has started to shift towards showing AA being more affectionate and nurturing though (Kim's Convenience is a great example)."

14,i4camf,"Yet at the same time, I've been to primary school in Taiwan where students were spanked on a regular basis. What does that say to Taiwanese society when corporal punishment is normalized even in the public school system?"
15,i4camf,"Well I don’t see a majority of white families promoting female infanticide, discouraging education, and other highly backwards ‘traditional’ beliefs. And it isn’t Asian American children that claim that abuse is ‘traditional-‘ it is the Asian parents that use filial piety and distorted Confucian nonsense to support their toxic behavior. We are taught from our parents that mutual respect is a foreign ‘white’ concept, not vice versa. Asian American children are correct for choosing to wield positive coping behavior (stemming from Euro-centric Family cultures) as opposed to learned negative volatile behavior from their Asian parents. You can try to claim that the Asian parents may be immigrants from a third world country and underwent great traumatic experiences, but it doesn’t excuse bad behavior/parenting. You don’t need to punch a baby in the face to teach it to stop crying. You don’t need to whip a child just because you’re too prideful to say sorry. You don’t need to starve a child into obedience. You don’t see other races treating their children (especially girls) like property and not human beings. You only see Asians condoning this behavior or choosing to turn a blind eye. So yes, it is an Asian problem. Yes this problem is prevalent amongst Asian families living in Asia. Social/cultural factors and the lack of family support play a huge role in mental health and pervasive abuse/domestic violence. 

Abuse and mental illness go hand in hand. It is not surprising that both of these issues are huge stigmas in Asian culture. Families will stay hush and neglect treatment when a parent exhibits mental illness with physically violent episodes... even at the expense of the children’s well-being. So yes, this girl is wrong. And unless our community recognizes so, we will continue to produce generations of traumatized emotionally stunted Asian Americans."

0,a66qs6,"Looks like they're trying to cast Asian actors in the lead roles.  They're also looking for a black actor for Jet.

Maybe they're learning from their past mistakes with the backlash to Death Note and anime adaptations others have done.  See a couple comments complaining about Spike *Speigal* being Asian but he always looked like he could be Asian in the anime and there's a lot of plausible explanations they could go with.

Regardless, wish they would leave well enough alone with anime and not butcher it the way they've historically done. Cowboy Bebop is great on its own."
1,a66qs6,"I mean Shinto Watanabe did base Spike on actor Yusaka Matsuda, so if people are gonna pull that he looks white card....."
2,a66qs6,"It would've been nice if they were gonna cast an Asian like [Don Lee](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3011350/) as Jet, but black works too."
3,a66qs6,"Good! Spike may have been a little ambiguous, but the canon is pretty clear that Faye is Asian"
4,a66qs6,"Sure, why not. Although the reason people are unhappy is because they keep whitewashing.

Dragon ball live 2009 had a white goku but Asian chi chi and other Asian actors... it's like they don't want to give lead roles to Asian men. And in movies they just like to pair up every Asian woman with a white man. 

Spike's name isn't very Asian but as long as they make it a good film then that's a priority. However, casting Asian actors as leads will help heavily with Asian male image because it's horrible right now in Hollywood. "
5,a66qs6,"\[Insert Unasked for opinion from Black lady\] I think it is nice that Netflix is finally trying to stop whitewashing live action films based on Anime. Also, I think most people of my race wanted/saw Edward as Black, so why are they casting Jet as Black? Make Jet Asian like Spike/Faye and give us Edward."
6,a66qs6,"It pleases me greatly to see so many people on the main subreddits getting triggered by this. These same idiots will swallow any convoluted in-universe explanation for why an Asian anime character with an Asian name in an otherwise homogeneous looking Asian country can actually logically be a white person, but can't wrap their heads around an Asian woman and Jewish or German man having a goddamn baby lol"
7,a66qs6,You know what I think?  I think its time we blow this scene. 
8,a66qs6,"***THANK THE FUCKING LORD***

But then again they might cast someone who’s *extremely* white passing. Wouldn’t be surprised at this point. Kind of expect it actually."
9,a66qs6,ugh what's with all these live actions trying to remake good animated shows. Leave what's already perfect alone.
10,a66qs6,I would rather them not make any live-actions
11,a66qs6,Where do we apply if he wanted to be in it? Or submit headshots
12,a66qs6,"Is Spike Spiegel supposed to be Asian? I always head-canoned him as being at least part Jewish due to his hair texture and last name. And Jet Black looks super white, but they're making him a black man... because he's scary looking? 

Making Motoko Kusanagi a white woman is a different issue entirely. "

17,a66qs6,It’s weird that they spelled our specifically looking for a 14-year old actress for Radical Ed when they give age ranges for every other character they’re casting for.
18,a66qs6,any info on how to audition?
19,a66qs6,"So, having watched the anime like 5 times over. I remember some of the back story well enough. Also, I think there's a manga, but it came after the anime. I have no idea how the manga fits in. 

Spike Spiegel: 

from Mars colony, part of the Red Dragon syndicate (i.e. Chinese triad). All the triad bosses had stereotypically Chinese names.  I suspect Shinichiro Watanabe, who was a fan of Hong Kong cinema which was really hot at the time, wanted to include the triads but didn't want a Chinese (or Japanese) lead. Note also the heavy Bruce Lee influence in Spike. 

Faye Valentine: 

from Singapore, but not explicitly mentioned to be Asian, and SG does have a lot of non-Asians. Valentine is not her real surname. She mentions being descended from the romany once, but that was probably bs. I think I read that her character was based on Faye Wong in Chungking Express, but not 100% on that. 

I love this anime so much that I just want to see it not butchered. That said, Asian representation would be amazing. "
20,a66qs6,"I never really envisioned Spike as Asian, like in a real life form. For example I liked the idea of Keanu Reeves playing him a while back. But I'm not opposed to it at all. It'll be interesting to view him differently. I think he was also based on an Asian actor anyways? As for Faye, I definitely see her as Asian. She's from Singapore too. "
21,a66qs6,If it's not Keanu Reeves this will just be another live action Death Note situation
22,a66qs6,"The two castings that would be perfect, *to me* , would be Bautista as Jet and Skai Jackson as Ed - doesn't get much better than those two.

As for Spike and Faye, yes, asian or asian-american actors are a great choice."
23,a66qs6,"It's gonna be so difficult to find someone that can play Spike and be relatively young and asian.

Not many famous asian american actors that are young in general and Spike is a difficult role to play."

For everyone asking ""who is Jenny Yang"":

* She's a regular collaborator with Angry Asian Man, on both [his podcast](http://angryasianman.libsyn.com/022-jenny-yang-returns) and their show [Angry Asian America](http://www.laweekly.com/arts/politically-charged-comedian-jenny-yang-doesnt-care-if-she-comes-off-as-respectable-5534029).  
* She regularly produces [hilarious videos](http://jennyyang.tv/videos/) on topics ranging from the [Fox News Chinatown segment](http://jennyyang.tv/video-gallery/2017/1/15/fusion-yangs-world-response-to-fox-news-watters-world), [stupid shit white people say to Asians](http://jennyyang.tv/video-gallery/2017/1/15/buzzfeed-if-asians-said-the-stuff-white-people-say), and that [white chef whitesplaining pho to Asian people](https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/09/watch-the-hilarious-parody-response-to-pho-is-the.html). It is very likely that you've seen her in some of these videos and not known her name.  
* She founded the [Comedy Comedy Festival](http://comedycomedyfest.com/), dedicated to showcasing Asian American comedic talent.  
* She founded [Disoriented Comedy](http://www.disorientedcomedy.com/), a touring stand-up comedy group of APA women.  
* She is regularly interviewed on Asian American representation and media in outlets such as NPR, The Guardian, and the BBC.  
* She is someone you should absolutely know if you consider yourself to be tuned-in to Asian American issues.

The OP assumed, wrongly, that subscribers here would pay attention to APA activists. It's unfortunate that this is not the case, and that Yang is unknown to so many of you.

Reading condescension into internet comments is easy because tone doesn't translate easily over text. But there's no need to attack the OP for paying attention and being *honestly surprised* that Yang is so unknown, especially in a community that is full of people who consume APA-related news regularly.

I hope in the future, more of us pay attention. On top of getting angry about the issues, it's really important to acknowledge and support the efforts of Asian American activists who are putting in real sweat into our community."

Not all white people are wealthy, privileged, and networked like the Kennedy or Bush families. There are white people that were dealt a bad hand in life and don't deserve to be racially discriminated.

There are people who think Asians deserve ""reverse discrimination"" too. Stereotypes that all Asians excel academically and have high paying jobs like doctors and engineers, so Asian have nothing to complain about. In certain sectors like high tech industry, Asians are treated like whites from a reverse discrimination perspective.

I don't agree with choosing which groups are okay to discriminate against based on their perceived ""success""."

1,t216g5,"It's kinda sad when one of the the main takeaways from the LA riots was rooftop Koreans, and how it was twisted into different narratives. Right wing gun nuts romanticize about it, and hardcore lefties see it as greedy shopkeepers shooting black people in the name of profit.

These businesses were the livelihood of many immigrant families. Some of them even lived or slept in the backrooms. Also, I think people forgot or ignored the fact that LAPD bailed and went to go protect the neighboring wealthy neighborhoods. Those Koreans were left on their own. Protecting their stores with guns was a last resort. Also, many of the rioters were armed as well; another forgotten fact."

3,t216g5,"Excerpt: 

> Some of the most enduring images from the Los Angeles riots are the photos of armed Korean shopkeepers patrolling the rooftops of liquor stores and laundromats to deter rioters.

> In some Korean Americans those images inspire pride, and in others, shame. The actor John Cho, he told me, felt mostly panic and fear. Then 19 years old and a student at UC Berkeley, he could see how the images were being interpreted and worried that they would spark more hostility toward Koreans.

> In his new young adult novel that he wrote with Sara Suk, “Troublemaker,” his goal was to start with those photos, and zoom out.

> “We wanted to start at that stereotypical image of the rooftop Koreans. Our thinking was, ‘What if we could humanize this person? What would that look like?’”

> Though written for a young adult audience, Cho’s novel is a sincere attempt to make sense of an event that we are still trying to understand. This year is the 30th anniversary of the Los Angeles riots, and though we are still trying, I don’t think we have fully made sense of what happened. In 2017, for the first time since the riots, a Loyola Marymount University poll found that 6 out of 10 Angelenos surveyed believed that another uprising is likely within the next five years.

> Cho doesn’t see himself as an expert author or historian on the subject. But now, at 49, he is a father too, wrestling for the words to explain an event that his own parents have always discussed in hushed Korean behind cupped hands.

> So last summer, as the George Floyd protests broke out and anti-Asian violence was on the rise, Cho decided to write a book about the Los Angeles riots. He describes it as the book he wished his younger self could have read.

> The novel follows a young Korean American boy named Jordan trying to reach his father, a liquor store owner, on the night that the riots break out. His goal is to deliver a gun he found at home to his father, so that he can help protect the store. The narrative locates itself around the violent chaos of that night, but never inside of it, turning down the volume to focus on the relationship between Jordan and his father."

4,qx5fu6,"People just hate Asian Americans because we don’t conform the way they want us to. That’s what it boils down to.

1,j5z8qp,"From the San Francisco police Instagram:

On September 15, 2020, San Francisco Police officers from Tenderloin Station responded to the 100 block of Turk Street regarding an assault. The officers determined that the victim, a 78-year-old female San Francisco resident, was walking on the 100 block of Turk Street at approximately 7:30 AM when she was assaulted. The suspect struck her in the head causing her to fall and lose consciousness. She was transported to a local hospital where it was determined that she had suffered a broken hip.  
⠀  
On September 22, 2020, at approximately 4:16 PM, Tenderloin Station officers responded to the unit block of Jones Street regarding an aggravated assault. They located the victim, a 71-year-old female San Francisco resident, on the sidewalk. She had visible injuries to her face. The victim’s son told officers that the suspect had passed him on the sidewalk and that he then heard a noise behind him. He turned around and found his mother unconscious on the ground. He chased the suspect to Market Street and back to the area of Golden Gate and Jones Streets but lost sight of the suspect. He then returned to assist his mother.  
⠀  
Through the course of an investigation, sergeants from Tenderloin Police Station’s Investigative Team (SIT) identified the suspect in the September 15th incident and issued a crime alert. On September 30, 2020, at approximately 1:00 PM, officers from Tenderloin Station located the suspect standing on the 300 block of Turk Street. Officers took Michael Turner, a 34-year-old male San Francisco resident, into custody. He was booked at Tenderloin Station on the charges of aggravated assault \[245(a)(4) PC -felony\] and elder abuse \[368(b)(1) PC - felony\].

Tenderloin SIT sergeants continued the investigation of the September 22nd incident and determined that Turner was the suspect in that case as well. On October 5th, investigators arrested Turner, who was still in custody, and charged him with battery resulting in serious bodily injury \[243(d) PC – felony\], elder abuse \[368(b)(1) PC - felony\], a probation violation \[1203.2(a) PC\] and violation of a stay-away order \[166(a)(4) PC\] as Turner has a criminal court stay away order from Market and Jones Street for a prior weapons offense.

0,v7e9jk,Yes… this accidental or willful exclusion of Asians as POC is a thing. Joining a WOC professional group a few years back was one of the most isolating experiences I’ve had in my life. I joined to find community but soon realized that the group was only interested in “black and brown” issues and voices. This kind of marginalization from other WOC felt like a harsher rejection than any I’d experienced in white spaces.
1,v7e9jk,"Once in high school my half black friends spent an entire lunch period trying to convince me I wasn’t a PoC. At one point they were like “look, see how the skin around our fingernails have this darker color and yours doesn’t do that? Not a person of color.” 

Anyway, now I bring this up sometimes and theyre very embarrassed"
2,v7e9jk,"I kind of experienced this irl with people I know.  For reference I am Chinese American and the two people I am referring to is Black and Latino.

I consider these two my friends and both having generally progressive views. During the height of the BLM protests they were talking with each other and generally processing with each other over the whole situation. I wasn't part of their conversation but was still in the same room talking with other people. I over heard my Latino friend say that Asians ""weren't really minorities"". My black friend nodded in agreement. I heard the backend of this convo and had turned with a raised eyebrow and this kind of ended their convo. I never brought it up personally with either.

This is my opinion but with how Asians have been portrayed in media/popular culture and how much the Model Minority Myth have been pushed I think most BIPOC/Latin Americans legitimately do not view us as POC sometimes. They truly think that Asian Americans (specifically East Asians as unfortunately most Americans don't see South Asians as being Asian which is a whole other topic of discourse) don't experience race based discrimination/oppression. It is frustrating because if you try to argue or explain that this isn't correct it could easily fall into the oppression Olympics."
3,v7e9jk,"I am East Asian and identify as POC as I'm certainly not treated like a White person, but like you mentioned, it's becoming increasingly apparent that to a large majority of otherwise ""woke"" people, we don't count. I teach very liberal college students, and they've said all sorts of things that killed me inside. For example,

* A student wrote that Asians are more ""similar in phenotype"" to Whites so they may have more privileges
* A graduate student wrote in their thesis, ""...racial minorities compared to Whites and Asians...""
* When I asked my students to give examples of ""White privilege"", one said that Whites and Asians get advantages in college admissions."
4,v7e9jk,This is a byproduct of the model minority myth. Basically a tool white supremacy uses to put marginalized communities against one another.
5,v7e9jk,"I was trying to set up a business profile on google the other day and had to send feedback because there were options for black owned business, Latino owned business but no Asian owned. It’s sofrustrating"
6,v7e9jk,"Being keenly aware when people don't want you around unless beneficial is the Asian American experience.

Convenient ally, convenient scapegoat."
7,v7e9jk,"Luckily the other POC I met IRL are smart enough to not buy into this mind set, but it's concerning how certain sections of the internet are picking it up. They absolutely double down when you call them out, too..."
8,v7e9jk,"So we have white privileges but without the privileges, which is basically nothing"
9,v7e9jk,[deleted]
10,v7e9jk,"I'm African American and to me it is as plain as day that Asian people are people of color and experience racism. Look at all of the ridiculous caricatures of Asians that have been in media. All of the stupid stereotypes have been cemented as fact in some people's minds because of television. It's the same with all POC. We all get shown to be some stereotypical caricature of ourselves in media and worse, put at odds with each other."
11,v7e9jk,"It's really upsetting. Asian Americans get attacked for race all the time but no one acknowledges it and think we're ""like the whites"" but ask any Asian American if they feel white and they will always say no."
12,v7e9jk,Everybody non-white is colored according to the white Americans. Even if you are purest ivory skinned asian you are yellow to them. Lol!
13,v7e9jk,"i feel like because asians are so diverse and different, people tend to generalise and forget about certain asians. 

the only issue that i've seen discussed is assuming asians mean east asians and leaving out other asians, which definitely needs to be said since so many people are ignorant that asia is not just east asia. it's also quite american centric because no one ever discuss the other issues. such as how poc is assumed as ""black and brown"" people which excludes ESEA and north asians? and also how in other countries like the UK, asians tend to be assumed as south asians and other asians are excluded"
14,v7e9jk,"Agree with you OP fully, but at least the author didn’t say something completely outrageous like “East Asians aren’t POC”; that kind of double standard makes my head explode"
15,v7e9jk,"no wonder why I felt iffy with the ""BIPOC"" term tbh"
16,v7e9jk,"we are people of the global majority. we are also POC, and included in BIPOC. If you're Asian you may identify as yellow which is a goofy white man construct to distinguish you from being, yknow, white. Or you can also identify as brown in more South/East/Southeast/Middle East contexts. 

yall need better friends"
17,v7e9jk,I frankly can’t even believe this is even a conversation. Asians are obviously people of colour end of story.
18,v7e9jk,"This is cruel to asians who identify as POC (particularly darker-skinned asians). but I can see it confusing in laymen’s interpretations especially when some Asians don’t identify as brown and there is such a range of QoL experiences of being Asian in America that often don’t get discussed.

All asian Americans would benefit from categorization with the POC term but when laymen see that many Asian ethnic groups are high income earners (note not wealth) and they see the many immigrants who come to college with wealth from their home country, laymen start to question that categorization, especially when POC is so closely associated with suffering and lack of privilege.

This is where blanket applications of race for whole regional areas can get more complex than common conversation and vocabulary leads on."
19,v7e9jk,"I’ve heard this term used before but we really are “Schrodingers Minority”. I say this as someone who is fairly progressive as well.

We’re considered POC for one moment and then thrown into the “white-passing” category the next. It all depends on which agenda the other person wants to use.

It’s like we can never get a time or a movement to our own."
20,v7e9jk,"The main issues my siblings and I have had is we are mixed and at different points of our lives or different times of the year (like summer when we were kids we would get 
very tan and look much more Indonesian) people assumed we were different ethnicities. If I was around whites people I clearly stood out as “ethnic” and would usually get questioned about my ethnicity, which I don’t mind answering. I would rather educate people than be offended. Around other Indos I was lighter than many and it was pretty noticeable too, but they never ever asked me about it. I’m guessing because being Dutch-Indonesian isn’t that rare when you are with other Indonesians. This subculture/ethnic group was around for hundreds of years when the Dutch first colonized Indonesia. My family has such a mix of Dutch, Indonesian, and Dutch Indo genetics it’s nearly impossible to break apart those genetic trees to see where everyone originated from. 

I find I usually adjust myself in whatever situation I’m in. No one has ever assumed correctly my ethnicity. Only white people ask me if I have any “ethnic blood.” I won’t answer that question because WTF kind of question is that, but eventually it comes out I’m mixed race. My son somehow looks more Indonesian than I do and I married a Swedish guy. He has a much darker complexion. His older brother looks like my husband and is very pale. It’s shocking the audacity of people who have asked me in public (STRANGERS) if my sons have different fathers or if one is adopted. Mostly older white people. How is this socially acceptable??"
21,v7e9jk,"Liberals and other minorities will use Asians when it benefits them. When they don’t, they will discard us. With right wing conservatives, they will use Asians to drive wedge between blacks and Asians and use college as a topic to drive a line. 

We Asians have to look out for ourselves and also do what Jews do. What’s good for Asians? Ask these questions"
22,v7e9jk,"for real, i'm an asian poc."
23,v7e9jk,"I'm working hard to bridge the divide between our communities, especially between our community and the Black community, but it's disappointing when other POC invalidate our struggles and often only acknowledge their own. 

As minorities, we should all be standing together instead of actively preventing progress by fighting each other.

Since much of White society ostracizes us, and many other POC do the same, should we say that we're POC when functionally, we're really not?

What are we?

We're just Asian people.

An uncomfortable part of America that doesn't seem to fit into its political narratives.

I just stand up against racism regardless of how others label or perceive me.

In the end, the truth will have the final say."
24,v7e9jk,"Person of color is a personal identity.  It isn't up to others to decide that term for you. 

I consider PoC as more of an American political term, a way to unite black and Latino voters into the Democrat party.  You don't usually see too many conservative blacks and Latinos calling themselves ""persons of color."" And that term isn't even commonly used outside the US.

1,mxt9x4,"Right there with you. He has a history of violent racism. Not just dumb tweets or bad costumes, but actual violent hate crimes. It’s disgust me that he wanted a pardon so his restaurants could carry alcohol without showing any sincere remorse for his actions."

From his wiki:
> One individual attacked by Wahlberg when they were a child opposed the pardon, saying: ""a racist will always be a racist."" 
Judith Beals, who had been the prosecutor in some of the cases, argued that ""Wahlberg has never acknowledged the racial nature of his crimes"" and that pardoning Wahlberg would undermine his charity work, saying: ""a formal public pardon would highlight all too clearly that if you are white and a movie star, a different standard applies.

&#x200B;

> Another racially-charged incident occurred in April 1988. The  **then-17-year-old** Wahlberg assaulted a middle-aged Vietnamese-American  man on the street...

&#x200B;

> Wahlberg would explain that **he was high on** [PCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phencyclidine) at the time. 

I am not here to make excuses for racism.  I am here to just comment that after reading your post I wanted to read more and realized you left out the fact he was **a Child** during the first noted incident and was **17** at the time of the 2nd incident and also **high on PCP** at the time.

Personally when someone is a child or young person, I believe in much forgiveness, leniency and hopefully the parents/community/authorities using this as a sign that these children/young people need help/attention/training. 

The kid was using PCP at the age of 17 years old, that is the kind of drug that makes people jump out of windows, he needed **help from his own self**, he was on a road to an **early grave** most likely before even becoming a man."

3,j8m7sf,"I have mixed feelings about racism against Asians getting a lot of attention these days.

It scares me because it makes me feel unsafe and anxious. It’s a kind of racism I haven’t really had to experience before. I kind of want things to go back to how it was before, where we just got stereotyped heavily and were treated as an exotic novelty.

On the other hand, I hated the stereotypes and hearing the same dead horse stomping jokes over and over. The escalation of racism against Asians into assault and hate crimes is making more people aware that it’s a thing that exists, and it feels somewhat validating because before it wasn’t particularly considered as severe or as negatively impactful as the discrimination that other POCs faced.

It’s also a strange feeling to see so Asian-Americans coming out of the woodwork in various industries, either getting recognition for their achievements or being some of the first to break into roles and areas that Asians didn’t typically get into for whatever reason. I’m whitewashed as hell and most if not all of my close friends are non-Asian. If it wasn’t for all the attention Asian Americans were getting now, the limited amount of media that I’m exposed to normally wouldn’t have any Asian American representation. It also includes all the new/old celebrities being more vocal and proactive about changing the way Asian Americans are being portrayed.

It feels like I might not have to go through a process with every new person I meet, where they are surprised to discover that despite my 100% Asian ethnicity, I have way more in common with your average Caucasian American born citizen than I ever will with my 1st gen immigrant counterparts or my parents. I hate the feeling where I’m looked at like an absurd freak of nature that beyond comprehension because I look Asian and have mannerisms, interests, and a lifestyle comparable to what most think of as garden variety apple pie eating American.

On the positive side, it’s really cool to see other Asian Americans do their things, chase their dreams and break new ground despite being told that it had never been done before and that they would fail.

It’s also nice to have more unique aspects of different Asian cultures deep into common knowledge. Paired with Asian American writers and entertainers putting out new material that isn’t just a repeat of the same old inaccurate racist tropes. Characters are becoming relatable, jokes are actually funny, I feel a little less like a lone island in the middle of a vast sea of media that depicts a world where people like me don’t exist.

This was a weird rant, but here it is."
4,j8m7sf,"Honestly, I blame Trump 100% for amplifying racial tensions in the past 4 years. He's openly racist and experiences no repercussions for his actions. So in a way he's normalizing trashy behavior to his followers, because they know nothing will happen to them either. Due to covid, many jails are letting offenders go. And it's not like cops really cared about AA communities anyways. So if you call the cops after an incident they'll just take a report and file it in the bottom of the pile. 

All I can say is, we need to look out for each other. See something, do something."
5,j8m7sf,"I feel safer going to foreign countries than traveling within the U.S. I can't wait the travel ban is lifted. I mean if you go to a red state and wear a mask, you are already labeled something. That + being asian is dangerous. I'm just glad I live in a very safe area where racism is nonexistant. But hearing that japanese guy get beat up in manhattan is fucked up."
6,j8m7sf,"In other words, water is wet."
7,j8m7sf,"I dislike saying it.

But this is a manufactured hate.

And the rhetoric has been manufactured by the USA.

People like to think that the problems in HK are due to the government being harsh.

But it is quite easy for the USA to push rhetoric of ""freedom"" and ""revolutions"" as that is one of our founding principles.

To put better perspective as to what the USA fears. You only have to look at the current global fortune 500 list and see how many Chinese companies have now made it onto that list.

I use this for my stock guesses.

But they are legit concerned. Beijing only has to decide to set the course for the country and the entire country will move in the same direction.

China only had 1 rioting city. HK.

The USA had multiple cities up in revolt and a WH cabinet all infected with Covid19.

To the rest of the world China looks to be more stable. And that scares the USA.

All you have to look at is how the USA is combating Chinese companies. Using unfound lies and rhetoric to try and reduce the threat. TikTok, Huawei, and WeChat. All accused of on outright lies and assumptions with no proof. Effectively against everything that America stands for. What freedom stands for. 

You can see similar effects against our Asian American communities as the result of this.

They cannot stop the shift in economics. You can even look at Walmart and wonder why they are #1 in the world. This is an easy answer. They have entered India & China.

0,d5ki2h,"I cannot believe how many people are willing to defend Shane Gillis. It is so disappointing to me to watch many members of the comedy world throw their weight behind him. 

I am ok with comedians pushing boundaries, but it always depends on context. Going on a racist rant on your podcast doesn’t seem like comedy to me. Even if he truly meant it as a joke (which I don’t believe) it wasn’t funny?? Is the weirdest part to me. 

Comedy is demanding that your audience follows you wherever you go. Often comedians take you to the edge, make you feel uncomfortable and pull you back. But after watching the clip, he honestly just seems racist. 

Something else that people keep saying is that we shouldn’t dredge up old things people have said. And I somewhat agree. I can forgive Kevin Hart for tweeting homophobic things in 2010. But Shane’s racism is recent. And it seems like the only reason he is going on racist tirades is because “everyone is too sensitive now” (which I also don’t believe)."

Monkeypox circulates among rodents in Africa, so if we’re seeing it in people outside of Africa, there’s a threat of a human pandemic that wouldn’t otherwise be there."

This came from the top down (one of the main reasons why it gained so much traction) as part a deliberate and concerted effort on the part of the administration in power at the time to distract from their complete failure in leadership to competently address the pandemic once it reached our shores. I wouldn't blame the media so much, beyond providing coverage, as Trump and those other fucks in his shit administration who relied on the trusty tool of racism to divert attention and anger from themselves, along with so many the American public who so easily, predictably, and eagerly bought into all the bullshit. I agree that this society is loathe to cast aspersions on any Western European group, especially when there's any type of biological component that can be implied, and is all too willing to blame and direct their anger at any vulnerable minority if for no other reason than to have a face to target and attack. I hope that this also serves to illustrate just how flimsy and ephemeral the model minority illusion is; that is, most favored minority status can be rescinded as easily  and quickly as it is seemingly granted, at the merest whims of Whites who still hold control, at their convenience.

I personally started with media to understand what Asian American is, if such a pan culture could even exist. I recommend checking out:

 • HBO’s Warrior

 • PBS Asian American documentary 

 • Minor Feeling: An Asian American Reckoning by Cathy Park Hong 

• Sigh, Gone: A Misfits Memoir by Phuc Tran 

• These Violent Delights by Chloe Gong 

• China Men by Maxine Hong Kingston

3,qrml27,"I’m sorry my man. I have a bit of an idea of what you’re going through. Military brat whose father abandoned him (dad asian/mom white) who grew up moving across the country. I thought I didn’t fit in because I was constantly moving. It wasn’t until I moved to Hawaii (predominately Asian) did I realize how much of my identity was tied to my race. Moving here I found people who treated me not like an Asian person, but as a PERSON. I grew up ashamed of my heritage, even though I never personally related to it. Now that I’m around people who respect me I have SO much pride in who I am. We have the best food, we are polite, people, we take our shoes off before entering other houses, etc. I never realized how “white” I acted until I could compare it to other Asians (you can recognize it so you’re already a step ahead of where I was). But overall I found that Asians won’t treat you differently because you “act white.” As long as you have chill, bring good vibes, and respect other cultures you’ll fit in

People may tell you that you’re being too sensitive or that everyone’s too PC but they don’t go through what we do. Anime and squid games may be more mainstream but that is NOT accepting Asian culture rather commercialize one aspect of a very diverse people.

Don’t let others take away your pride of being who you are. I encourage you to live/travel where there are other Asians. It’s done wonders for my self esteem and I bet it would help yours as well."
4,qrml27,"A lot more will start to make sense once you are able to travel and explore the world outside of your predominantly white rural area. Seeing, tasting, speaking, living, experiencing, and learning about different cultures is extremely eye-opening. Plus, you can start off with domestic travel first. San Francisco, LA, and NY all have “towns” of various Asian cultures (Chinatowns, Japantowns, Little Saigons, etc). 

I can’t wait for you to try your first dim sum or experience your first bowl of pho."
5,qrml27,"This is a long and common struggle.  The USA is all based on ancestry and appearence.  I always said I was Asian when living in the US because that was how they saw me.  When I went abroad however, people called me Northamerican because of the citizenship I held there despite my appearence.  It was the first time I was called American."
6,qrml27,"If you have Facebook, search up “subtle asian adoptee traits”. It’s a private group filled with so many fellow adoptees, and a ton of us have a very similar experience to yours feeling like we don’t belong in either group. There’s a real sense of community and solidarity among us, and it has made me feel better interacting with others going through the same feelings."
7,qrml27,Similar situation for me. It’s very hard!
8,qrml27,"You are Asian enough and American enough and VALID! <3 Simply by the fact that you *are* both. No one can define for us what it means to be “enough” in either world.

I’m an ABC and I always felt like I needed to prove to myself that I was making more of an effort to embrace my Chinese ethnicity. (Trying to learn about the myths, holidays, history, things that are in fashion, etc.) But then I kind of realized that I should just accept my upbringing and who I am and that it’s okay that I don’t know it all or blend in completely. We were raised in America around American culture and can’t help that, and we get to choose how much of our ethnicity we embrace. :)

You’re not alone in your journey!"
9,qrml27,"""I feel like my life is just a lie to both sides."" 

It seems like your sense of self worth is tied to how well you fit in with other people. Self-confidence should be developed from within. Rock climbing, solo travel, martial arts, etc. are great ways to build confidence in yourself. Go for it!"
10,qrml27,you're one of us brother whether you like it or not :)
11,qrml27,"Of course this post is allowed! It sounds like you are realizing that your life is unique and you’re having trouble finding an existing narrative that coheres to your experiences, so you don’t feel like you belong anywhere. 

My life isn’t exactly the same story as yours, but in my early 20s I realized that the inverse was also true. Because I belonged no where, I also belonged everywhere. If I looked deeply enough at individual people, I could always sense a shared human experience. When I adopted this mindset, I realized there were several things true to my nature of being an outsider— I have enormous empathy and I adapt well to different environments. I ended up living in several different cities and countries, made good friends everywhere and fell deeply in love with my partner (Indian, not American). I embraced the weirdness of my life and realized it gave me the privilege to pick and choose which parts of both cultures that I wanted to be in my life. There’s a hint of Swedish, some are Indian, some are Chinese, a small bit that’s American. When you are in an in between place, there’s a freedom that exists to design your life the way you see fit.

You’re life isn’t a lie. If you ever move to a big city or travel, you will see that there are millions of permutations of living. It’s the existing cultural narrative that is over simplified."
12,qrml27,"In my experience, just do you, do what you wanna do and fuck everything else. Appreciate who you are, find your own line. And eventually, you will find people who appreciate that. It takes time, energy, and is an incredibly slow process, but I assure you it's worth it."
13,qrml27,im(31m) Chinese with my birth parents and grew up in a predominantly white area. AMA if you like. I feel like i can relate to you
14,qrml27,You’re not alone. I think all of us struggle with this broadly whether we grew up “in the culture” or not. Be simply who you are. Your ethnicity or culture doesn’t necessarily define you.
15,qrml27,"“Just be yourself” is easier said then done but in practical terms don’t try to fit into any predefined mold. Don’t feel obligated to be someone else’s perception of who you should be or how you should act. Start by exploring and finding things that interest you, then try to find others, regardless of their culture that have the same interest. Going to a diverse college helps as well as you’ll be exposed to people from multiple backgrounds. There’s always other people like you, you are not alone."
16,qrml27,"Same here, though replace predominantly white with predominantly black

I grew around black kids due to being in that part of town and going to the school there so all my friends were black.  Being from Vietnam I was even a bit darker than most Asians I’d encounter in the other parts of town.  So I decided to flip it on its head.   

I can walk in both worlds.  Not many people can do that and I can.


All in all,  just sounds like you have what we call “a unique perspective on what it means to be an American.”"
17,qrml27,"I am Japanese and was adopted into a white family, I 100% understand how you feel. I try to fit in with more Asian friends now that I am an adult but it still feels hard being comfortable in that space, like I feel like an outsider. Same with when I hang out with my non Asian friends. 

I don’t know what the solution is but know you’re not alone in feeling that way."
18,qrml27,"It's ok, that's pretty much the Asian American experience. It's much less pronounced in the northeast where I live, though, not without incidents. I went to a dive bar around the corner from me the other night and an older drunk chick tried to hit on me by doing a generic offensive asian accent and called me a sexy samurai. Like, very mixed feelings about that.

&#x200B;

Don't feel bad about not being asian enough. It's not a thing. Yeah, you're always gonna be called out as different when you live in a white majority town. But if you can, come to one of the coasts, northeast or west, you'll find that hanging out around other Asian Americans means commiserating over exactly what you're feeling."
19,qrml27,"I grew up around a lot of white folks too although I was lucky enough to have a vietnamese church community. i think what you feel is common in the asian american community, although maybe a more extreme version having been raised by a white family. i know a lot of us feel out of place. the thing is, it’s okay. just be you. You are who you are and that’s a beautiful thing. You are unique and have your own story."
20,qrml27,I'm similar except I'm Korean.  My parents didn't do anything to keep my cultural identity.  Their philosophy was to pretend I'm white and it won't matter to me anymore.  It doesn't work
21,qrml27,I feel you. I'm dark skin Asian born and raised in America. My family was next to the hood so we're more black washed. But who says you have to fit in? Just be yourself and the right ppl will find you.
22,qrml27,I feel the same. It’s hard being mixed (although I look Asian) and not being able to fit in both sides. It gets easier when you get older depending on where you are though.
23,qrml27,"MOVE TO A BIG CITY

Preferably one with a sizeable Asian population"
24,qrml27,"Everytime I read about people complaining about living in Japan, ""they'll never accept you as Japanese if you're white, even if you live there 5+ years and speak Japanese"". No shit dude!  Try being an Asian American who was born and raised in the US with completely fluent no-accent English (much better than your fluency in accented Japanese). Unless you live in one of the bigger cities (LA, NYC, SF, Houston, Chicago etc)."
25,qrml27,"I feel like there is a lot of bullying that can happen about being 'asian enough'. Your identity is someone you ought to take ownership of independent of how people perceive or label you. If you want to be more asian or reconnect to your asian heritage there are ways to do that. If you want to live your life as someone with little ties to cultural heritage that is also something that's totally okay. Regardless you must reframe it from something i've lost or something I'm lacking in to something I've chose for myself. 

Secondly I'll say - I think being a minority in an actually minority environment (where you're the only asian) is rough. Not because of cultural lack but because of judgement by others. I'm inclined to say 'F\*ck 'em.' If they expect you to be a certain level of 'asian' and you don't want to be - speak up. Say so. Or if you're not willing/comfortable with asserting a personal definition of identity, then I'd recommend moving. 

I'll also add - it's totally okay to find that other cultural markers are greater than ethnic. I feel like there's a tendency to over emphasize ethnic identity in modern as am culture as if every individual in america must have a robust take on identity.  I feel like we identify ourselves in all sorts of ways and it's totally fine not to have a dissertation level understanding on how your upbringing affects you. You could be someone who likes to read, someone who's an adoptee, someone who's the child of divorced parents, someone who's into film, farming, etc, etc. All of these markers of identity have their own merits."
26,qrml27,"There is no way you would not fit in with Asian Americans. I got plenty of twinkie friends who don't even speak Chinese. I got cousins that don't speak a single word.

The shared Asian American experience, sadly comes from *being treated differently by others*."
27,qrml27,"A lot of the time it’s not the citizenship set you apart… it’s aways the “strong opinions”, the “subtle American value” that keep you from blending in."
28,qrml27,"how old are you? (don't need an exact age, just a ballpark)"
29,qrml27,"Sorry you feel that way friend! Isn’t it crazy that while us humans tout that we are the only species capable of reasoning and being civilized, we are still very much primitive in that we treat people based on their looks and a lot of times can’t see past that as if there is a mental barrier? I too, had and still have trouble finding a spot where I can ‘fit in’, it frustrates me a lot and I still get sad and feel lost from time to time. But recently I am starting to think that maybe it doesn’t have to matter after all. Our survival brain is hardwired to fit into a group, it was useful for survival, and though we have progressed technologically far beyond that, our instinct stayed, and I figured that instead of letting this dictate me, I can acknowledge this feeling and try to move on. I am who I am, I don’t have to let other people decide whether I am a foreigner or an American, I don’t have to let people who are so shallow that they can’t see past outer appearances to define my identify and self worth. Deep down I know myself the best, and whatever think I am, I am exactly that, good or bad. It is a difficult journey that many privileged people don’t have to take on, but I think it’s one that’s well worth your effort and energy as I truly believe the further I go the more at ease I am with myself. I still get uncomfortable in certain situations but I can recover from the terrible feelings much much faster than before, and to me it’s enough.

100 years or 200 years later the world will be a much different place, who knows if the concept of being some kind of <country>an/ese will still be around? The so called national identity is a tool that serves governments much better than it does average people, we are, after all, creatures living on earth who happen to get grouped into different tribes that we now call countries. Break away from that, live in the future, free yourself!

Sorry about the long rant, I hope you feel better!"
30,qrml27,Would you be interested in the subreddit r/mixedrace? The name is a bit of a misnomer as it should deal with other mixed experiences.
31,qrml27,"Dude! I was adopted from South Korea when I was 4, and grew up the same way. I’m high school I tried to fit in with the Asian kids, but didn’t ever felt like I fit in. As I grew older, I’ve accepted that it’s not my outside appearance that makes me who I am, or my upbringing, but who I am in my heart and soul. Now, I don’t look in the mirror and think I’m Asian or white, I am just me. I Hope you find yourself. 😊"
32,qrml27,"Hello, fellow Adoptee! I was born in Korea and brought into a white family. I hear you. 

Having friends who are adopted makes a world of difference (at least it did for me), specifically those who are adopted internationally. It's nice to talk to others who also have experienced the feelings of not knowing medical history, not knowing biological family or biological family generational history, lost culture of origin, feeling othered among those closest to you, etc. If you have the opportunity to befriend a fellow asian Adoptee, I encourage it. Feel free to DM me, even!

Just know that Asian America is big enough to encompass all Asian Americans - we are a subgroup, and even though we are spread out, often living in predominately white neighborhoods, we exist."
33,qrml27,"Your feelings are valid. I think many Asian-Americans can relate to you, I definitely can. 
It is a constant struggle with personal identity when you are seen as a “perpetual foreigner” by non-Asians and possibly “white-washed” by those who are Asian. 

How about this idea- take a step back from your identity involving race and ethnic background. 

You are so much more then being Chinese, being American. Define what and who you want to be. If others choose to constantly put you in a box, then I think they’re missing out on who you truly are. 

You are American enough. You are Chinese enough. You are whatever you wish to be. Don’t let anyone define who you are."
34,qrml27,I was also adopted as an baby from China. My parents are white as well. I grew up in a diverse area but there weren’t any East Asians at all. I think what you’re feeling is quite common for adoptees. I don’t have the answers you’re looking for. I’m still figuring it out for myself and I feel the split that you’ve described. I just wanted to let you know there’s someone else feeling the same way and we’ll find peace with it eventually.
35,qrml27,"If it helps it's pretty common for adoptees, it's also pretty common for mixed folk like me. It's always felt one foot in one foot out to me. Both being Asian American and being Jewish. Ironically I find the most acceptance in queer groups but even that's pretty white centric most of the time, even if my personal circle is pretty diverse."
36,qrml27,"I feel similarly, being mixed race. Other than this sub, which is very compassionate and supportive, I don’t feel accepted by other Asian people, because you can tell I’m not fully Asian by looking at me. Most of my friends are white . . . but they don’t see *me* as white. The only “people” I have are my siblings and cousins who are also mixed."
37,qrml27,"I take inspiration from a couple college professors in midwest universities.

They don't just look different. They SOUND different. Their accents are thick. 

They are in the middle of Missouri. Places that this sub would write off in a heartbeat.

But holy shit they love it there and they thrive there.

I think there is a certain amount of ownership and self confidence that we sometimes need to bring ourselves manifest.

They aren't shameless but they walk and talk like they were in America all their lives. I've seen them parlay random conversations with strangers into budding friendships over the course of 20 minutes. We went to a shooting range and he engaged in conversation with a stranger in line- the guy went from standoffish to letting my friend shoot his pride and joy rifle. 

If you already don't have the accent and you have similar interests with people- own it. There will be moments where you will feel you don't fit in and without giving usable advice....sometimes you gotta will that acceptance to existence."
38,qrml27,"perhaps you shouldnt focus so much on your race/ethnicity so much and just see yourself as a unique individual(which i know is hard somtimes)

yes,people may stereotype you at first but when they get to know you they will start to see you more as an individual.

i kinda disagree with asians not accepting you,have you tried to connect with other asians,you may be surprised?

and also what people are you naturally drawn to,not just race wise but also like just different types of people in general.

&#x200B;

i think you will find that there will be people who will accept you for who you are if you put yourself out there.

and also if you want other people to accept you for  who you are,you have to accept yourself first

and also try to accept that you stick and your different,embrace it in a way."
39,qrml27,"Its not an inherent part of being asian in america imo, just where you live. I grew up in a diverse town with plenty of asians.

A lot of asians were super popular, and i felt i had way less in common with them then my white friends. 

Also, i might be wrong, but i really dont think most white people, even in rural places, are just judging us based on our skin.

I think most start off a bit curious, ""oh, theyre asian!"" And then once they see that you talk like most people, act like most people, it becomes a nonfactor."
40,qrml27,"There are \*dozens\* of us that know exactly what you are feeling! 

But seriously, you are one of us, and your experience is every bit as valid as the next!  Please take care and reach out"
41,qrml27,"I am in the same boat as you! I was adopted from Taiwan at age 11 and i also live in a pretty not diverse area where I am pretty much the only Asian person here. I also feel like I am stuck between two worlds too because my “Chinese” is spoken with more American accent and I also have hard time relating to other people. Anyways, you are def not alone and I think maybe living and making friends with people who also feel and goes through the same struggle might help?"
42,qrml27,hey op are we the same person? jk but I feel very similarly
43,qrml27,I would challenge you on the idea that you don’t fit with other Asians because of your upbringing. Many Asian Americans grew up in white suburbs just like you did.
44,qrml27,"I can't understand what you went through, but even in Asian areas in the US sometimes I also feel like I don't fit in because of my face."
45,qrml27,"I am not a Chinese adoptee however I feel like I can relate to how you feel. I have filipino immigrant parents that moved to the southern US. I grew up in a suburban white neighborhood and I was almost always the only Asian kid in school. Growing up around white people made me very disconnected with my culture and made me experience a slight cultural shock when I joined the Asian student union in college. I didn't have any Asian friends until then either. My mom is also very Americanized and white washed. 

You're feelings are valid"
46,qrml27,You good bruh. Don't think too hard about it. We accept you for who you are. You're as Asian-american as it gets.
47,qrml27,just letting you know that you are not alone! i’m adopted from south korea and i’m in the same mindset. all the love and support coming from here!
48,qrml27,"Based on another post in your history, I'm guessing we grew up in a similar area, and this reminds me of one of my friends from high school who was a Korean adoptee in a white family, and while we were friends for several reasons I wondered if part of it was that I was one of the few other Asians in school (even though we have different backgrounds). 

The Asian American experience contains multitudes- it's a political identity for us to band together for strength in unity, but with multiple countries and waves of immigration, one size does not fit all when it comes to experiences. But you're also not alone- as others point out, you're not the only transracial adoptee navigating identity. Another book rec I haven't seen mentioned: All You Can Ever Know by Nicole Chung. 

Also: know that American Chinese have a long history in the western United States, even outside of California. In fact, [the oldest continuously running Chinese restaurant is in Butte, MT!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pekin_Noodle_Parlor) There actually used to be a LOT of Chinatowns dotted across the west, but between the Chinese Exclusion Act and rampant xenophobia many were extinguished. When people think the intermountain west is super white, it's because systemic racism pushed to keep it that way. You have every right to be here and to take up space, in your town, in the Asian American community, etc."
49,qrml27,"I have a black mom and my dad was white. I look kinda mexican-ish. I’m not adopted, but I just ended up not resembling either of my parents and it’s not obvious that I’m their kid due to how the racial mixing turned out. 

Growing up I couldn’t relate to my dad as much when he was alive because he was a very white, average sized man, and I am a brown, small sized man - on top of that, I’m gay. The world is going to treat me different than if I had just turned out to be a mini version of him. We couldn’t relate much to one another and it was obvious. I can’t relate much to my mom’s experience of life as a black woman either, for obvious reasons. I ended up not having much of a culture or really fitting into any racial culture. Not white enough to be one of the whites, not black enough to be one of the blacks. It sucks not being able to identify with your parents and family members. My husband was born and raised in China, and he came with all these cultural values, recipes, language, groups and clusters of people who look similar to him and share some common things. Seems nice, huh?!

I don’t have a big solution but just know that you’re not alone. It’s nice to be in diverse areas where people mingle across racial lines. It helps when there’s not an overbearing, strong majority culture (usually white) surrounding you. Being in a 90+% white suburb with white parents as an adopted non-white is going to feel isolating, probably. 

At the end of the day I say eff it all, be you. Find your comfortable place and some peace. Culture is overrated imo. Maybe that’s cause I don’t really have one. But I think we all bring our own flair and flavor into the world. You can’t go back in time and give yourself Asian parents or somehow make yourself have a white person’s physical appearance. So there will always be some differences between you and an Asian who grew up in a traditional Asian family or between you and a white kid who grew up with white parents. But these differences are minor in the grand scheme of things, even if they do feel haunting and frustrating. Don’t make it a point to focus on too deeply and definitely seek out diverse environments."
50,qrml27,Everyone has their own journey in regards to race.  But you are welcome here!
51,qrml27,"Hey OP. I just want to say that you are what you are and biologically you are Asian. 

Living in a predominantly white area is what MANY Asian Americans like you and I come from but don’t fear!! What really helped me go back to my roots is to meet other Asians online or download apps to find and make Asian American friends so you will feel closer to who you are. It just feels better to be with someone that looks like you so you don’t keep growing that “outcast” feel. 

I would also read actual history of your Chinese roots and learn more about yourself online. Hope that helps"
52,qrml27,"Yeah, you're not Asian, nor White. You're Asian-American, and your concerns are still concerns in more Asian urban areas.

Having said that, there's nothing preventing you from learning more about Asian American history now, or try to learn to speak (plenty of Asian Americans aren't fluent in their ethnic tongue). And if you don't like aspects of yourself, move away for college; It's a great time to reinvent yourself"

Cebulski's controversy first broke out in 2017, but Marvel hasn't taken any action against him, which says a lot about Marvel and the comic book industry. 

I'm so glad DeKnight acted morally and honestly. We can't expect people to quit their jobs for their morals, so it's absolutely amazing that he did. I'll definitely be following him closely for his future projects."

5,q7185v,"Ah CB Cebulski. Like an IRL Psylocke but instead of being an attractive British woman, he's a racist neckbeard. It's always a huge cognitive dissonance thing for me seeing Cebulski as EIC. Marvel has made a pretty strong push to be progressive in the past few years, which I appreciate, but at the back of my mind I'm always picturing that POS weeb pulling all the strings. If Marvel really wanted to prove they're on the right side of history and not just pandering to an increasingly progressive audience, they'd kick him out."

0,ppirab,"My parents did me a favor by sending me back to the motherland. In two years, I was fluent in two of my family’s ethnic languages. 

I think the diaspora really needs to rethink about how to approach the Asian American experience. Yes we’re Americans, but that doesn’t mean we should completely erase that part of ourselves. No longer are the days of complete and total assimilation. 

You putting your kids in a Chinese school is a good choice. 

The banana feeling for me comes from the fact that I’m not well versed in Filipino literature, mythology, and politics."
1,ppirab,"I say try to laugh it off and embrace it that you don't know a lot but you're trying. If you don't understand the teacher and think it's important, reask, or reframe your questions or push for some kind of English from the teacher. Good people won't care what your level of Asian-ness is, only that you're making a genuine effort. If you make mistakes as part of it, it should be considered okay too as part of the learning process. Apologize if it's needed, but don't beat yourself up.

If you are interested, a good way to increase fluency is to watch/consume Chinese media that has interesting subject matter to you. I watch movies, variety shows, dramas in Mandarin with English subs running and pick things up. And then slowly I've been pulled into some news here and there.

There are Chinese learning subreddits! /R/Chinese ...and probably more, I'm on mobile, can't copy and paste so easily."
2,ppirab,"I'm Thai and my wife is Korean. I probably have the language skills of a second grader and my wife doesn't speak Korean. Needless to say we've struggled with imparting either language on our daughter, so she just sticks to English. 

My wife tried to enroll our daughter in a Korean language school at a church by our house, but they gave her a hard time about it either because my daughter doesn't speak Korean, we're not members of the church, or maybe because she's not full Korean? We couldn't really figure it out, so we just didn't pursue it and the whole experience left a sour taste in our mouths...so at least you got your son into the school?

I think a reality of the diaspora is that everyone has differing levels of connection to their homeland, language, culture, etc. and it's not really anyone's fault, but it does make navigating spaces where you *look* like you should belong *feel* uncomfortable because of the disconnect. Also, there are always those gatekeepers who are judgmental, but as I've gotten older I'm starting to get used to not giving a fuck - like how exactly is it my fault I didn't grow up in the motherland. 

As a parent, how much can you really pass along when your understanding of the culture is incomplete? It's so hard and we're still trying to figure it out. I think with most things as it comes to parenting, you do your best to give your kids the tools they'll need to find their own way. 

I'm sure the teacher feels just as insecure about her English as you do about your Mandarin. I would think if she's a good teacher, she'll understand and not fault you for trying. And as for the other parents, hopefully they follow the lead of this xkcd comic: https://xkcd.com/1053/"
3,ppirab,"Gonna echo what /u/hokagesarada already touched on.

It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that the three years of middle/high school I spent in Beijing public schools changed the course of my life. I feel like I'm at a point where I can no longer identify with the ""typical 2nd-gen Chinese-American experience"" (whatever that might be), since I'm code switching between ""just Chinese"" and ""just American"" depending on where I am and who I'm with. One side effect of the pandemic has been that I don't even use spoken English on a regular basis anymore outside of work calls, since my wife is from Beijing and we use Chinese exclusively at home.

My daughter is just over eight months old, and I've got a decade and change to figure out how to enroll her in a Beijing public school when she hits middle school age. I was lucky enough to regain my family's traditional language and culture, and I want the same for her any her future siblings."
4,ppirab,"Don’t apologize for who you are. Take up space and be honest. Our parents assimilated because they wanted the best for us, and you want the best for your kid in our modern reality. They opened a school in America to help kids. You want to help your kid. So I hope they can do their job and be understanding that this is the reality of our diaspora. Help them help you. Ask questions from other parents, and I sincerely hope you find your way. (Easier said than done probably, I’m not a parent haha!)"
5,ppirab,"I relate as an Asian-American that had always been ashamed of what I didn't know or what I should have known because I'm Asian. However, when my grandmother passed and I saw my father have to figure out how to set up all the traditional ceremonial things and eventually overhear him say the equivalent of ""I googled it"" I realized that no one knows everything and that being ashamed keeps me from growing. Also, I started to realize the fallacy of having my mother be the authority on all things ""authentic"" and instead am eternally grateful for the internets to crowdsource what I think is the right answer."
6,ppirab,"I’m actually fluent in Mandarin and Cantonese... and trust me when I say that even if you speak the way they speak, they still treat you differently as an ABC. Our cultural values are different.

To white people - you’re too Chinese to be American.

We just learn to accept ourselves to be ourselves."
7,ppirab,"Whatever you do, don’t try to pretend to be something you’re not, because they’ll see right through you. Or it just leads to avoidable misunderstandings. I’m specifically referring to projecting an image that you’re more fluent than you actually are."
8,ppirab,"I'm 1.5 gen, pretty much fluently bilingual and pretty immersed in the culture, so while I have a kid in immersion school, I can't really help you with the ""banana"" feeling, even though I often joke being one myself when I'm in the company of *chinese* chinese people. 

My advice, if you chose to take it xD, is just not to stress about it too much, usually at immersion schools there are a few parents that are part of a mixed race family. (For example the class that my child is in has at least 3 kids where one parent is not Chinese, and I think there's also a kid who wasn't Chinese at all but was sent there because the parents thought being bilingual is a good asset),  just get (or make) any fun-looking lantern that doesn't read TOO CNY-y (as in too oval + red), some examples [here](https://www.zhidiy.com/tupian/2015/aoakvzipmwp.jpg) and [here](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R1Xdz6UjFX0/maxresdefault.jpg) and [here](https://uploadfile.huiyi8.com/up/f6/36/a7/f636a73493ada4191ca2eccaa77f0ef6.jpg) and [here](https://perak.chinapress.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ip190826ccmz08small.jpg). 

Chances are if you attend the event you'll probably meet a parent who's in the same shoes as you c: My parter is chinese but he immigrated as a toddler and barely understands mandarin (his native tongue is Shanghainese lol), so even us ""fully chinese by blood"" families are not as knowledgable of the culture as you might think, so don't be intimidated hahaha."
9,ppirab,"Hey OP,

I can't help with your heritage feelings...but as for surviving/prospering in the school, we have sent all our kids to public, Bi-lingual English/Chinese school, even though it isn't a first language for anyone in our home. fwiw, here have been some things that have helped us navigate: 

A. we finally broke down and got a tutor. find an ayi or someone's grandma, or a local college student who lives in the area just to come over two or three times a week for an hour or so to do half-homework/half-reading...this will remove the stress of YOU forcing your kid...and make it a more relaxed, 3rd party situation.  

B. throw yourself into that parent community...they will love having you, and they will totally be supportive, also probably help you navigate things with the teacher. what's more, you might score play-date invites over to their homes, and they will be surrounded by Chinese there. 

C: don't worry too much about the communication.  if easier...just email with the teacher, and use Google/Bing translator...or better yet...make your partner do it (if for no other reason, that it shows your kid, that BOTH parents value the Chinese language if your partner has the relationship with the teacher and asks about class/homework assignments)...if you decide to stick in a bilingual program...the lingua-franca of the playground will most certainly be english...so your kid won't feel left out. Even some of the native Chinese speakers have the same problem with their kids...they will speak Chinese, then resort to English because their kids just won't respond otherwise.  it's not just you!   

good luck, OP!"
10,ppirab,"I'm a parent, and my Chinese is decent. I used to be able to read the newspaper and watch the news in Mandarin, but at this point the rust has hit the point where I can't really read anymore, and I have trouble following spoken news in real time. And even though I had pretty good understanding when consuming Chinese, I've never been able to speak fluidly at nearly the same level. It takes me time to construct sentences and search for words and stuff.

My wife is not Chinese, or Asian, but her family has encouraged me to try to speak and read to our kid in Chinese. I put on some Chinese cartoons and songs from time to time, and I'll read her stories in Chinese with some awkward on-the-fly translation of the English language books we have, or just tell her stories in Chinese (I've got 3 little pigs and goldilocks down, but the others I still struggle to explain). 

We literally do not have any Chinese speaking friends in the city we live in, so there's not a ton of exposure except when I occasionally order food in Chinese.

When my kid is old enough to go to kindergarten, I'd like to put her in a Chinese immersion course, which is offered in the local public school system by lottery (pre-K through 6th grade, but once you're in you're in), but I'm still on the fence about whether it's worth the effort (and opportunity cost) compared to the local regular elementary school. 

One thing I wouldn't tolerate, though, is for teachers to expect you to meet them in Chinese. I don't speak a word of Chinese when I'm dealing in a professional setting, because my ""home turf"" is English and I don't trust my professional Chinese. If I were you, I'd do all teacher conferences in English. That way minimizes misunderstanding, and  allows you to focus on your role as parent rather than trying to split your attention with your identity as parent versus ""Chinese American who has some mixed feelings about one's own relationship with heritage and culture and mixing."" Cut that out and do what you need to do for your son, as a parent first."
11,ppirab,"I grew up a three hour drive from the nearest Chinese School, so I think you're doing great.

It took me until college to start really learning, then stints in Taiwan and China helped solidify my fluency, but in the 9 years since I stopped using it regularly for work and socially, it's eroded. I look up stuff constantly in Google translate when speaking to my toddler. What the hell is a leopard/dump truck/sculptor in Mandarin? Etc.

My partner is also not Chinese (I'm also the ""wrong type"" of Taiwanese too, so there's another layer) but she's been supportive of speaking as exclusively as possible in Mandarin. I'm going to bring her to a Taiwanese Mandarin school here when she's old enough, because most Mandarin language media here is in Beijing accent and she's staying to pick that up. I also get awkwardness from Mainland Chinese parents and monolingual parents on the playground.

You do what you can"
12,ppirab,"Not a parent so I could just be talking out of my ass. But I'd say to embrace it and hop on the Chinese learning train! It could be a great way for you, your son, and maybe even your wife to bond. Plus, it gives your son the ego boost when he inevitably surpasses both of you (languages are easier to learn the younger you are)

As for the every day interactions with teachers, I find that Google translate helps a loooooot (used to work retail with a lot of Chinese customers). My Chinese level is probably the same as yours, and Google translate helps fill in the vocab gaps I have. And whenever someone said a Chinese phrase I didn't understand, I would point blank say ""what does \_\_\_\_\_ mean?"" Never encountered someone who wasn't willing to explain

As for feeling like an imposter, what helped me is realizing that Asian adults are either A. American born like me and can therefore relate or B. immigrants and can therefore relate to the imposter syndrome I feel.

It's part of why I automatically feel so comfortable around Asians - we all have that same understanding of what it feels like to be an outsider

Edit: grammar"
13,ppirab,[deleted]
14,ppirab,"It's ""perpetual foreigner"" syndrome. You know that old joke?: What’s it called when you only speak one language? -- an American. Most Americans are proudly monolingual -- except Asian Americans.

Most ABCs are in your place. The vast majority don't speak Chinese anywhere near fluently, but the unease they feel about this is extreme. They're just uncomfortable being just an American.

As my Asian American history professor said years ago, we shouldn't feel the need to speak a foreign language, even if it's our parent's native language. If we spent our childhoods all the way through adolescence primarily speaking English -- English is our native tongue.

Don't let societal pressure make you feel this uncomfortable of being a plain American. Be secure in your own skin."
15,ppirab,"So I went to chinese school growing up, learned pinyin at home pretty early, lived my first two years of my life in China (born in the US). I think I went to Chinese school every week in middle school, assignments etc.. all that.

I never really enjoyed learning Chinese growing up (well foreign language in general), even though speaking/listening/pinyin was fairly trivially easy for me to learn (as in didn't require any conscious effort, just happened). The reason why (reading/writing) is simply because I never found any *real life use case* for this knowledge, and knowledge that goes unused decays quite quickly. I pick up speaking, especially new lingo, accents and mannerisms extremely quickly, but reading/writing, which is the real core of Chinese language is very difficult to learn (at least for me).

If you actually want to be successful with this, I think it will require more than a few hours a week, honestly I don't even really see how its possible unless the child develops a strong desire to learn which is going to come from either parental pressure or them connecting with some kind of subject material where learning Chinese is vital to that success, or just sending them to a different country to live for significant stretches of time (earlier is better). I'd probably try some media immersion as well (my parents read Journey of the West to me growing up).

I can still speak relatively well (Beijing accent as well), but I honestly do not use it very much unless I'm with my gf's family because I cannot communicate any high level concepts in it. At home I use English or Chinglish with my parents.

I follow Mainland/Taiwan information peripherally since I have a lot of family still living in Mainland, my gf's family is from Taiwan and my family has always maintained an especially strong connection to China despite the first members immigrating here in the turn of the century."
16,ppirab,"Cant speak for the rest of the post but the lanterns I used as a kid in the 90’s bay area were basically cute little characters that lit up and/or played a cute little song. Imagine a Sanrio stuffed animal but plastic and semi translucent, attached to a stick with a button that would control the light and music. Usually bought them in street fairs during Autumn Moon Festival. 

Full disclosure, I totally forgot about the playing with lanterns until you asked about it. It’s not too bog a deal, just make sure the kiddos have fun. :)"
17,ppirab,"I grew up in China but I haven’t had mooncake for years. I have no idea what lantern you should use either. I think culture is not something you try hard to get. If you’re in it you’re in it, like how my non-Asian Wing Chun teacher teaches kungfu in Cantonese and knows traditional kungfu rituals much better than I do, because he’s in it for real. I suggest find something you like and connect with Chinese culture through that path. Music, sport, history, philosophy, etc. When I learn about US culture, I only focus on what I’m interested in and skip others."
18,ppirab,"I feel you. I don't speak the language and it stings sometimes

That being said, I think we need to separate culture from race a little more in the Asian American community

Obviously there are specific Chinese things that people do. Knowing Mandarin helps if you're in a Mandarin community

But to the extent that an Asian American culture and community exists, it doesn't exist in any specific language

All of our ancestors spoke something different. Our ability to come together in this subreddit, to organize politically, etc depends on them having embraced a certain assimilationism in the past

Because of their work, we now have the space to critique that assimilation. We know bilingualism is good not bad, for example. Thing is, you and i wouldn't be here having this exchange if it weren't for that history

It's part of the asian american legacy. We are no less asian for it. Quite the opposite."
19,ppirab,"I'm a bit late to this conversation, but I am dreading this exact scenario once my little one is old enough for all this. And of course, my Mandarin is even worse than my Canto (grew up with the latter, my mom made me learn the former). At least I can still read a bit. My mom suggested I use an online tutor/course down the road...I'll have to look into that in a few years. She offers to babysit...which I may take her up on but our relationship is very complicated so I'm hesitant. My stepson is fluent in his heritage language (went the traditional language school route but his mom is fluent as well) and I would love even half that for his little sister but not sure how much I can actually facilitate this. Anyways, all this rambling to say, I feel this so hard."
20,ppirab,"Have you checked out r/mixedrace? Same stuff there, though I’d hope to focus on the mixed cultural aspects rather than the racial ones."
21,ppirab,"Most lanterns are plastics now. The lanterns can be as ""traditional"" looking as it can also be as kind of wacky (cartoon characters.) People still go around with the paper lanterns that you light up a small candle in though. If you go to an Asian store, they will have a section that you will see tons of plastic lanterns that you can hold and walk around that are battery powered with an led light. There should be another section that you can go for the paper kinds (they usually come flat so that you can pack then) those have a candle holder that you place the candle on(normally small birthday candles) and let it burn until the candle doesn't isn't there anymore.

Mooncakes are all based on what kind of filling that you like. The two most common is the egg yolk (the brown looking ones) and the white pasty kind, but there are other variations that have become popular. Some of the mooncakes have packing that show the filling has (say, purple might be yam, while very yellow filling might be custard.)

Have you tried something like Duolingo? They have a [Mandarin](https://www.duolingo.com/course/zh/en/Learn-Chinese) course, although I don't know how well it is done. You can also look up the most common words used by kids and put them into a computer flashcard. It's quite common for people learning Chinese and Japanese to have all the Chinese characters placed into flashcards (except, for someone to be proficient in Chinese, one needs to learn something like 10k characters.)

You can do something where you look up the most common words learnt and written in 1st grade or something, write all of those words on a flashcard and your way of pronouncing it phonetically.

I'm not a parent. I can listen and understand my parents language, but speaking and reading it is on a different level. I might google translate and look at a Chinese dictionary, but I'm not even close to a fluent kid.

So don't beat yourself up for it. It's good that you are bringing your kid to learn another language because it is common for second generation and further, from all persons coming to America, to lose most of their cultural language.

In practi e it just feels so much like cultural theft when people do this. Some bastardized copy of the original.

Ahh- this is a Southern Chinese thing.  Anyways, the lantern used is a folding paper lantern that you put a candle inside. Typically the paper lantern that is tied to and hanging from the end of a stick. So you can walk around with the lantern without it burning your hand.  Don't feel too bad when the lantern inevitably catches fire (usually when the kid sets it down)  and the kids have a great time playing with the fire. All part of the fun and games."

There was a point in my life where I very seriously was going to go into a media career because I wanted to create AsAm media representation, but I ended up in immigrant rights work. And I feel better about the choice because... while I care about both causes, between my measly $12 CRA ticket V.S. trying to get legal aid + DACA renewals + education/health/basic needs services to undocumented folk, one has a much more direct, bigger impact on the livelihoods of people.  I have limited time and energy in my day and between hoping that hollywood is gonna put another AsAm on the big screen and making sure that people I care about can stay with their families, I'm gonna prioritize immigrant rights work. Some of the undocumented AsAms I work with mention how disappointing it is trying to talk to AsAm citizens sometimes because AsAm citziens have no sympathy for their struggle, and will actively say ""go back and come here legally like my family did."" There is a very real stigma in the AsAm community for being undocumented and movies like CRA haven't done much to change that for undocu AsAms.

Look, I can’t speak to what it’s like to be black,

but I know how we talk about black people.

And it is fucked up — because it is a microcosm of America.

Asians, we love seeing black excellence: Barack, Michelle, Jay, Beyoncé.

Give me the Travis Scott 4’s.

We spent the last 5 weeks praying at the altar of Michael Jordan.

How could we be afraid? We love black America.

Yeah, on screen.

In our living rooms.

But if a black man walks into your living room,

or wants to date– God forbid, marry– your daughter?

You’d call the cops.

Dude, do you know what we call black people?

We call them “Kala,” it means black — not in a good way.

If someone in your family is dark skinned, we clown them.

We call them “Kallu.”

“Look at kallu!”

Our Bollywood stars do skin whitening commercials so we don't look black.

Thank you, Britain.

It is bad to be black in Desi culture,

even though we all wish we were black.

You don’t think that affects how we view black people?

20% of Muslims in America are black.

We don’t even like praying at the same mosques!

If they show up at the masjid we’re like, “Yo, is Farrakhan here?”

That is the great hypocrisy: we love seeing how high a black person can ascend in America,

but we have done nothing to raise the floor.

That is what these protests are about.

And the worst part is — we’re in this country because of protest — because of the civil rights movement!

The only reason so many of us are here is because of...

That law rode the wave of the Civil Rights Act of ‘64.

Think of the chess moves.

Martin gets Lyndon B. Johnson to sign that sheet of paper,

and little do we know, MLK CC’d us on that email of progress.

Because of that one signature, Ammi and Abbu were able to move to

Edison,

Fremont,

Plano,

Naperville,

Irvine,

Marietta,

Dearborn,

Twin Cities,

Schaumburg,

Sugarland,

Long Beach,

Dallas,

Sunnyvale,

Cupertino.

Ya know, the factories that make us?

All so that you could eat fucking bundu khan instead of being in Karachi.

“But hey it’s not our fight, right?

This is a black/white issue.”

America’s story didn’t start when we got here.

When you became an American citizen, you don’t just get to own the country’s excellence.

You have to own its failures.

That is the deal.

That’s why I can’t get this photo out of my head.

Because it’s cropped wrong.

Zoom out.

Who’s in this photo?

The officer who is blocking people off– he’s Hmong-American– he’s my age. He’s 34.

The guy who owns the store– did you know this?

He’s Arab-American!

His clerk called the cops on Floyd.

That is America.

A black man was murdered in cold blood— and we were on the fucking sidelines watching!

I’m not saying we were the ones who killed George Floyd.

But we have to be the ones who pull that cop off his neck!

We think we’re not a part of the story.

But we’re at the scene of the crime!

That’s why the full picture matters.

This doesn’t happen in a vacuum.

It happens in a system.

“Fine, Hasan, what do you want us to do?

How do you want us to support black America?

I did the little black Instagram square.

I had a tough conversation with my family.”

Fuck that.

This fake woke shit we do on IG dies in a week.

We can’t just knock out racism.

We have to help win this thing on the cards.

We have to donate our money and time to black organizations.

To all the doctors — offer free healthcare to protesters.

Tech people — help black businesses get online.

You work in IT? Set up a router.

You passed the bar? Good. Ammi and Abbu are proud.

Work pro-bono for protesters.

Pfizer doesn’t need any more billables.

Everything helps.

Be like Rahul.

He let protesters hide from police in his home.

You don’t even need a degree to do this.

0,mlf2m5,"Hopefully unnecessary disclaimer: I'm v liberal / v left but am also tired of the party which purports to stand up for me scapegoating asian issues.

It's entirely possible I've missed it, but has the NYTimes done any victim-focused reporting? The post-Atlanta journalism I saw was disappointingly murderer-focused, and what little reporting I saw on the deceased focused on the white people who died. I'd love to be proven wrong: I read the NYT a few times a week, so it's totally possible I've missed a piece.

I ask this because this article feels like the liberal equivalent of a ""lone wolf"" piece. It creates a framing that the POC who do attack asians struggle with mental health, scapegoating them to avoid addressing anti-asianness within the party, while simultaneously painting them as the ""real"" victims here. (Not saying all POC are liberal, ofc.)

I was heartened for a moment to see these paragraphs in the piece:  
> Mr. Lau, the bus driver in Brooklyn, said in an interview that he believed the punch he took from Mr. Lawson was rooted in a “breakdown in mental health issues.”

> Still, he said, the slur Mr. Lawson had used fit a pattern of racism he has experienced since childhood, when his elementary schoolteacher called him Tommy instead of his given name, Kok Wah, to prevent his classmates from making fun of him.

> “That’s how it is when you’re Asian, always being harassed by others,” Mr. Lau said. “The pandemic made it worse.”

But this segment not only came in 80% through the piece (it should have come much earlier, I feel), but also was depressingly short. It cut off directly into another attacker-humanizing paragraph."

0,hghb5x,"This is completely unsurprising. The amount of low income students going to top private schools is already self selecting. I go to a T20 private school and my girlfriend goes to one of the HYPSM, and low income students are extremely rare to begin with.

Further, look at the size of the CUNY system vs an Ivy League. We simply have to look at the numbers. CUNY has a total of 280K students. Compare that with Harvard or Princeton, with a student population of 6-7K. 

One of the main ‘purposes’ of these top tier schools is not to yield low to middle class mobility. They are pipelines for middle class to reach high class, and/or to ‘maintain’ upper class legacies. Just look at how much these schools care about legacy and connection. If you went to a lesser private or a CUNY, the chances of you getting an interview at a top firm like Goldman or Blackrock are almost zero to none. (Even top public schools liks Berkeley Haas have troubles landing these positions). On the other hand, HYPSM feeds countless interns to these coveted positions every year. This is the same thing with medical school (look at application costs), the same thing with tech (Stanford entrepreneurship culture), the same thing with architecture, aside from just finance. High paying jobs with high social statuses are often structurally biased toward top schools. 

This is not to discredit the benefits of a good public university system. Nor is it to say that a CUNY graduate can not achieve flying colors. But, as shitty and amoral as these social divisions are, you have to concede that school liks Harvard do not serve the same functional and social purpose as a school system like CUNY."
1,hghb5x,California has sort of the same system. The Cal States helped propel my family (brother and sister) from a family of working class immigrants to solidly middle class and beyond...well the Cal States and the Military.
2,hghb5x,"The ivies and top 20 have always been and still are playgrounds for the rich. Low and working class students have to jump through an unbelievable amount of hoops just to get through the door, and once they're there, there's no support systems, told to ""just figure it out."" I know from experience. But hey, they tell me that I'm already lucky for getting in. HYPS are all talk and no do about equity, while schools like CUNY and the Cal states are actually helping people get out of the hole. Stop aggrandizing your ""holistic admissions process"" and maybe look at why a whopping 20% of students at schools like Yale come from families making more than $630,000 a year while only 2% come from the bottom 20%."
3,hghb5x,"CUNY and california university system are great way to propel unremarkable people into well to do position. Not everyone can be as remarkable as those who gets into ivies+, but throughout the world, there is a trend where higher education standard and opportunity yields better income and standard of living for people.

Also, the idea of using ivies+ as a right of passage to better lives for low income students are a bit insidious to me. Ivies+ are mega selective and people who got in there are super remarkable. But why should anyone in low income community MUST BE super remarkable to be promoted to middle income or upper middle income? Why can’t they just be given enough resources and opportunities to help them to achieve better lives?"
4,hghb5x,"I'm curious if these same metrics apply to grad programs as heavily as undergrad.

I have a master's from a top 25 ranked school in my field, but I'd eventually plan to apply for a doctorate way down the road.  I know searching for the best fitting PIs and research interests is one thing, but for the general grad application?  Not sure how admittance would be treated since these are funded positions."
5,hghb5x,I know so many people that did NOT attend ivies or other tops schools and they’re doing quite well in life. There are many great public schools that have networks and access just as the ivies do. It’s also a myth that top companies only recruit at top schools. They may not go to no name school but they’re still going to the good public universities and liberal arts schools.

There’s a lot of of “fuck Yang” and “traitor” comments I see popping up online but is that ever really appropriate to say because the guy wrote a tone deaf opinion piece? 

I personally liked Yang a lot because I felt his environmental policy would open us up to a lot more climate change prevention and regression paths than the Green New Deal solely by itself, plus I also work in the creative field so UBI would drastically improve my life. But almost most enlightening to me about Yang was his Humanity First message. A lot of political discord these days is fueled by vastly opinionated disparagement. A lot of “fuck Yang,” “fuck Warren,” “fuck Trump” is going on and has become pretty much the standard way to communicate politics on a lot of social media sites and groups, and I personally think two of those three names haven’t done anything remotely critical enough to deserve such bombardment.

What I’m pretty much trying to say is that you can disagree with Yang—I know I do on this very op-ed topic and also a lot more with his relaxed treatment towards Trump—but you can do that without seeing the guy as an absolute villain. Steven Yeun, a Yang supporter, came out with critical comments when the op-ed was first posted but gave his actual own thoughts and even noted that he can support someone but not always agree with them."

0,tacsnl,"I’ve never been to Europe, so I don’t have any experience with it, but a lot of my Asian American friends who studied abroad in Europe have told me that the racism there is much more overt rather than in the US. Not saying that overt racism doesn’t happen in the US, but I’m personally more accustomed to the covert kind of racism, often disguised by “dog whistles” rather than the more blatant racism. 

Of course, both kinds of racism should not be tolerated, but that’s just anecdotally what I’ve heard in my community. It’s pretty annoying because I often see Europeans online claiming that “racism is a product of the US/American society” or “Why do Americans make everything about race?” when they have their own issues of inequality that they are oblivious to. Their overt racism is so normalized we can’t even call it out without them claiming it’s an American issue. I can’t even count how many times I’ve seen a European on reddit claim that racism isn’t a problem."

Europe is one of those places where they don't actually realise they're being racist against Asians. In school, people would say ni Hao to me on a regular basis and if you confronted them about it, they'd just say ""I'm just being friendly what's the problem"". 

Not only this, when I was the only Asian in school, i was never called my name but referred to as the ""Chinese"". This was wasn't something I liked but was something I had to get used to, cause once again, they don't realise the racism. In my last year of high school, I remember the school finally had another Asian student enrolled, even though he was Japanese, people would still refer to him with the same ""nickname"" that they had given me. He appeared fine with it, but I would say it's most likely that he had to accept it just like I did. 

Ultimately it boils down to the fact that they don't realise how they're being racist, so you'll either have to properly explain or just get used to it"
5,tacsnl,"I'm second generation Chinese, I live and grew up in France and uhh... I'm sorry you all had such a bad experience of France... I am sorry OP that you met someone so rude :/

It's true that there used to be a lot of racism against Asian people in France to be honest. I had people yelling ""Nihao"", ""Konichiwa"", ""tchingtchangtchong"" at me all the time grewing up by classmates and strangers almost every day. I saw a kid picture book with a Chinese butcher running after a dog to kill it when I was little. I was also made fun of all the time and was told that I was ""dirty"" because ""I was Chinese and I ate dogs"". But in my opinion, I think that there is a lot less racism now than let's say in 2005. I feel like people are more aware of it, at least the huge majority of French people I meet every day would not say such outrageous stuff anymore and recognize when someone is being racist.

I actually have not witnessed any racist comment directed at me for the last 7 years during all the time I was in Paris. But I did face racist remarks when I lived for a year recently in a more rural city so I think that Paris may actually be more Asian friendly(?) than rural areas because the Asian diaspora is more prominent in big cities. In my humble opinion, I feel much more confortable in Paris as a Chinese descent than elsewhere in France. 

I also understand why many Americans would find French people rude, but Parisians are actually not very well liked by many other French people either. I think that the culture is just vastly different. For example, in Paris it is rude to stare at a stranger, you also don't speak to strangers in public places for no reason because everyone is busy and mind their own business as a tacit rule. Servers in France don't rely on tips like in the US so they don't feel the need to chat with the customer, their only job is to serve your food and drink. So lots of tourists aren't used to it I guess... Paris is unique in its own way even among French people"

There's a ton of South Asian people in London; in fact, I think they make up almost a fifth of the population. And so that means that while people like me don't stick out, the racists also just have more targets. Cue the random men on the Underground and at the airport yelling ""terrorist"", etc.  at my family. We went to France on the same trip and that was fucked too, kind of—France's whole thing is ""universalism"" which basically means you're not ""Vietnamese"" or ""Senegalese"" or ""Lebanese"" but *French*. Which is just mandated color-blind racism. There it was mainly underhanded comments and weird looks. I'm so sorry that you had this experience in France. Europe has a lot to learn and they've got to come to terms with their own history of racism, slavery, and colonialism/imperialism. France thinks that it's so great for abolishing slavery very early, but tell that to the enslaved populations of French colonies which were exempt. Or the African and Asian European immigrants treated absolutely vulgarly dating back to the original colonial exploits in Africa and Asia.

\> I don’t expect French people to know the differences in each Asian ethnicity.

Yeah fair but also France has actually a giant Asian population due to colonies in Southeast Asia and India, as well as possessions in China. They've got to do better if they're gonna keep talking about how France is a post-racial paradise. (Also post-racial? so the Chinese victims of police brutality are being disproportionately killed and harassed because they're just committing more severe crimes? the POC communities in the impoverished banlieues of Paris live there by choice?)"

But in Europe (and I find this in Asia as well), being racially different is broadly seen as foreign."
25,tacsnl,I feel like being fetishized as a male isn't really that bad.  It's better than taking a hammer to the head...
26,tacsnl,"As an Asian man I really **do not care** if girls ""fetishize"" me to be frank. It's not the same as men fetishizing Asian women. I do not feel endangered and it doesn't offend me in the least. If anything, I think it's great that more girls want to date Asian men through Kpop or other media.

It sucks that they assumed you were Korean, but is this really an issue? It seems like you're making posts over non-issue microaggressions because you have poor social skills."

0,vq1h07,"This tweet nodding to *Get Out* and its satire of West Wing liberalism reminded me of the problems in transracial adoption which White Americans or otherwise tend not to acknowledge as an aggregate. I don't quite remember where it was that I first learned about it, but it might have been from adoptee Asian Americans right here in this sub. 

I don't think I have ever seen any mainstream coverage of the scenarios where transracial adoptees grow up to feel severe loss at being severed from their own background, and their White adoptive parents turn out to be oblivious to non-White struggles or outright racistly White supremacist in condescending upon non-White people, possibly even having a savior complex for ""rescuing"" their adopted kid. It gets even worse when you factor in the persistent White apologism for the United States, among other fucked up things, replacing Spain as colonial overlords of the Philippines, turning a blind eye to Japanese crimes in Korea for a while in exchange for Japan not interfering with U.S. control of the Philippines, and reneging on moral support for Ho Chi Minh who might have won democratic elections but France did not want Vietnam to become independent so rural Vietnamese communities got Agent Orange.

The best acknowledgement is that some years ago, I read in the news about the scandal of Ethiopian children growing up and getting their 'adopted parents' to realize that they not only remembered their own parents but said parents were under the impression that their children were being temporarily mentored by wealthier guardians as per Ethiopian custom, not permanently adopted out. I don't remember if the lying ""adoption agency"" was actually shut down or not. I'm not sure I know any White Americans offline who know about this incident against hapless children and their parents in developing economies. It all gets enabled time and again by sheer White arrogance."

2,suq5t0,"Just watched it and it was so funny. She wasn't playing a caricature of Asian American stereotypes (see Ken Jeong) nor was she avoiding the topic entirely.

I also appreciated this mention:

She never stoops to denigrating his Asian-ness as a negative, or a thing that exists “in spite of” these other qualities.

And this was a great quote as well:

>he debut of Don Wong is auspicious. We are living in a time when it is awkward, inconvenient, and dangerous to be an Asian American, and more specifically, an Asian American woman. COVID-19 has been a clarion wake-up call. We have been targeted, via hate crimes. Aspiring to whiteness did not and will not save us, now or in the future. And the Black-Asian solidarity that does exist is developing in some places, but tenuous in others. Solidarity requires reconciliation—of addressing past wrongs and of charting a path forward, one that does not demand we fight for the bottom rung on the ladder of respectability."

>He crossed the busy intersection at Roosevelt Avenue, where he had once grabbed his sister’s “boss”: an elusive, square-headed man known as Lao Li. Song Yang had paid him as much as $400 a night for a 40th Road apartment and the illusion of protection.

>Their tense encounter had attracted a crowd, as Mr. Song waved down a police car and insisted that this “boss” be arrested. Explaining that things do not work that way in the United States, the police had allowed Lao Li to scurry away, leaving Mr. Song confused and angry.


>The mother and brother were leaving that night for John F. Kennedy International Airport. It would take them a full day of travel to return home to China’s northeastern province of Liaoning, where the family plans to bury Song Yang on a mountainside.

>Ms. Shi, 66, sat bent on her bed. She is a much frailer woman than when she first arrived more than a year ago. Several months ago she required hip-replacement surgery after tripping or being knocked down on Main Street. She began talking of her gratitude to the United States.

>But the face of her son, sitting across from her, darkened with every word of praise for a government that he believed had caused and covered up his sister’s death. Suddenly, he threw a suitcase lock in anger. It hit a wall and clattered to the floor.

>“All that’s left of my sister are her ashes in a box,” he said. He listed other sorrows. A mother who was now broken, physically and emotionally. A father whose hair had turned white. A wife and son he had not seen in more than a year.

2,snas7p,"I bleed red, white and blue, but I'm happy she did this for two reasons.  One, the USA is still silent on AAPI violence, and I support any AAPI who wants to represent the country of their ethnic background.  Two, she stands to make more money by representing China.  Every single brand in the world is desperate to their their products in China, and they will throw all their money at Gu to be their brand ambassador to help sell into China."
3,snas7p,"Huge, huge congratulations to her!

And to all the MAGAs who are going to complain about her competing for China:

1) Shove it. As Asian Americans we exist between two worlds and our heritage and culture derives from both. We can represent both simultaneously, as Eileen has done here.

2) Maybe this will be a wake up call to stop treating Asian Americans like sh*t and start giving us basic dignity and respect. When you racists keep telling us ""Go back to China"", many of us will, and when we do we'll take our unique talents with us. Or as Eileen put it better:

> “I remember at the beginning of the pandemic, I was with my grandma in a Walgreens in San Francisco and this haphazard, haggard man runs in screaming profanities about Asian people and how they were bringing the virus in and how it was super dangerous. I don’t think I’ve ever felt fear like that in my entire life.

>“This was in San Francisco – supposed to be the liberal bubble within California, which is the most liberal state, in the most liberal country in the world. This was supposed to be the safest place and I felt physically in danger. I grabbed my grandma and we ran out. I was so scared. That moment was definitely a reset because I realized how close to home it hit. That anybody can be affected just because of the way they look or their culture and heritage.”"

6,snas7p,"You know, Asian-Americans try to do so much to prove that they are ""American"" enough.  Asian-Americans react negatively to her representing China because they fear that it will continue to perpetuate the idea in America that asians are foreigners.

But honestly, I think it takes amazing courage to do what she did.  To say I am American, but I can still represent my heritage and culture.  You might not agree, but you have to admire that bravery.

Asians need to learn that we have nothing to prove, nothing to hide, and that who we are is enough."
7,snas7p,"Meh don't really like it but I recognize that it's none of my business who she represents. People represent their country of heritage over their country of citizenship all the time (though I feel like the usual situation is that it is easier to make the national team of a smaller country than the USA which clearly doesn't apply here). 

Choosing which country you represent on the international stage is inherently a political statement and the US also can be the beneficiary of such statements (for example recently Levon Aronian, current #6 chess player in the world changing his federation to the US while being basically an Armenian national hero). And it's also natural that the people of the spurned country may feel slighted.

It's important to remember that (most of the time) the individuals motivation for choosing which country they represent should be evaluated seperately from whatever propaganda spin the US, CCP, or whatever country tries to put on it.

Just bc I detest the idea of representing China on the world stage bc my parents were born and raised in Hong Kong, doesn't mean shit if representing China is just what's in her best interest. Good for her on winning the gold. Sucks it isn't for the USA.

Edit: Just as an addendum, I do strongly disagree with the strawmanning nature of the top comment by OP implying anyone who doesn't like the fact that she is representing China is some MAGA cringelord. I think its unproductive and dangerous to imply that Asian-Americans must feel a certain way about an issue, especially one as devisive as the optics of representing China as an Asian-American. Not every Asian-American is Chinese. Not every Chinese-American is a fan of China. We all have different levels of attachment to both our country of heritage and the USA. There are many legitimate reasons for Asian-Americans to like and dislike what she is saying politically by representing China at the Olympics. I get really annoyed when some Asian-American communites use the concept of ""solidarity"" to shut out the wide variety of AA experience and viewpoints."

2,oyymi0,Me getting told I have a small penis by friends all the time isn’t very fun huh.
3,oyymi0,Totally felt this growing up. Now I'm so old that IDGAF. Thanks for sharing.
4,oyymi0,I hate that this happens to anyone. Asian men are desirable. Asian men are sexy. Asian men are worthy. Asian men are men!!!
5,oyymi0,"I’m sexy as fuck and so are you, my brothers."

8,oyymi0,[deleted]
9,oyymi0,"This was a good op-ed.

I’ll admit that I felt that way in the past. A need for validation by dating outside my race.

But as I’ve gotten older and reconnected with my roots, I’ve come to accept me for me.

Thanks for sharing"
10,oyymi0,I’m biased obviously but I’ve always felt that Asian men were the most attractive. And most don’t have disgustingly hairy sweater vest chests or serious b.o.
11,oyymi0,"I know I've told the story a few times but a friend's little daughter made a drawing of her and a boy. The little girl in the drawing looked like her: black hair but the boy next to her had yellow hair. When my friend asked why the boy had yellow hair, it was because that is what she saw in the cartoons, what the princes looked like. 

So between that early type of messaging/conditioning, along with other media showing Western looks as being desirable and Asians playing un-athletic, awkward, and nerdy boys, along with the whole small penis myth, it's sadly not surprising to see some women subconsciously swayed that way. 

Step away from the LARPing internet trolls and vitriol and you'll see that thankfully not **ALL** women, Asian or otherwise, believe in all that BS. Personally, Asian men have always been attractive to me and who I've always naturally gravitated towards and all of my friends feel the same way."
12,oyymi0,"I'll be honest, I've never once felt ugly. My mom fed me compliments since I was a baby to the point my first words were ""예뻐요"" basically translating to I'm pretty. What i did notice among my Asian friends was how judgemental parents could be. Don't get me wrong I understand that Asian men were jokes for most of the media, but I never personally felt that way and I credit a lot of that to my mom. 

My brothers and I all are confident outgoing men and that came from a confident dad and a loving mom. Be that change in the community too, don't just ask the system to change. Take a lesson from Ghandi and don't take part of your own oppression."
13,oyymi0,"not sure why people are surprised when america put people in camps, exploited our labor, prevented our families from immigrating here, capped our numbers, etc. also who the fuck lets movies and tv shows define your value and attractiveness. also if youre getting dating cues from media then your dad or your older brothers and cousins failed you. filipinos in 1930s got harassed and killed for dancing with white women. not saying its that extreme but dressing well and knowing how to dance helped those dudes then it should help you now."
14,oyymi0,This is gonna change as they are finally featuring Asian men in mainstream media.  I tried explaining to my son what a big deal GI Joe is featuring two leading Asian actors but he didn’t notice. Which I think is a good thing.
15,oyymi0,Watch more media originating from Asia. Plenty of examples of masculine and sexy Asian men out there. Can’t hope to rely on Hollywood for a fair portrayal
16,oyymi0,"Thanks for sharing that, I appreciate the read. This piece managed to articulate a lot of stuff I've felt for a long time but never could make sense of. It's hard to believe that the author was only 23!"
17,oyymi0,"I'm married to a white woman.  It still bothers me to see stuff like this.  White women shouldn't be the ultimate goal.  I just want asian men to be seen as viable in America.  The only thing I can do personally is to continue to be myself and set an example for my children.  Shang shi appears to be a step in the right direction cuz it's asian Americans, not Asians, who are the stars here."

I grew up in a very diverse city though so I might have just been insulated but I did start noticing that a lot of my Asian girl friends who dated Asians in high school and college are now married to non-Asians. Was initially just an observation but I wonder how much of this is played out in real life.

I do feel though for two of my co-workers who are both in their late to mid 30s, both Asian, and are bachelors. Both are cool guys. One is 5'3"" and the other says American women just don't like Indian guys that look like him. If there wasn't such a huge age gap, I'd introduce them to some of my cousins."

0,fpqot5,"Here's some advice from a brown Asian American who dealt with plenty of racism after 9/11:

Exercise your legal rights to self-defense. Find out what your local laws are, get whatever tools you find appropriate, and get the right training. Don't live in fear of actual racist morons, you have rights and can take care of yourself. Don't depend on 9-1-1 and the privileged folks who think the Cops are their personal SWAT Team.

Racism is unfortunately a fact of life, and has been since the dawn of humanity. This shit *always* gets worse when times get tough, but that doesn't mean you have to accept being a victim. Don't be a passive witness to your own oppression.

Leverage the rights that were once denied to your ancestors and take ownership of the safety of those whom you love."
1,fpqot5,"Trump supporters are blaming China for the Coronavirus.. Trump himself calls it the ""China Virus"".

Unfortunately most Trump supporters are too ignorant and uneducated to differentiate between the Chinese government, Chinese people, and the fact that there are other ethnic groups and nationalities in Asia.

Everyone gets lumped together and the end result is a disgusting exponential increase in racist attacks against Asian Americans.

Please for the love of god vote in November and get all your family members to vote.  Also, work hard to dispel ignorance and educate people on why such rhetoric from people like Trump has negative consequences on innocent people."

2,8s9pmr,Feel like the murder of Vincent Chin kicks off modern AAPI activism. Learning about this during high school and the murder of a Joseph Ileto opened my eyes about the violence against our communities
3,8s9pmr,"In all my schooling I had never heard of Vincent Chin’s murder until an Asian American history class I took in college. 

It’s interesting how some are able to ignore damaging the “model minority” stereotype is when it fits their narrative but when the so-called “model minority” is perceived as being too successful, they are then labeled as the “yellow peril.” "
4,8s9pmr,"Wasn't a Filipino killed a few years ago by a Hispanic man for being...Filipino? I forgot the name but the story was, the suspect asked the victim if he was Filipino and the suspect punched him so hard he died.

It is sad that micro and macroaggressions towards Asians are largely ignored because of the growing subtle ""Yellow Peril"" promoted by **both** by conservatives and liberals. If it's not ""they're stealing our jobs"", it's ""they're stealing our spots in schools"".

Such incidences don't even spark national coversations even if they are racially-charged crines.

I don't see anyone upset with these outlets for putting forth this frame.  That's because it's a fact and there is nothing to argue about here.  Many of us in this country appreciate the President's direct talk on this subject -- there is no skirting the truth at a time like this.   It's very funny that the lives of all of us in the world have been completely upended by the Chinese government's secrecy and failure to collaborate when it counted.  But even now -- the same bleating social justice panderers who call themselves Americans can only disparage the President and complain about racism.  These people contribute nothing to the national conversation, they are incapable of solving anything -- they just want to rail at the wind.  The President is invested in solving this problem and protecting this country.  I for one appreciate him being here now.

This person must be dumb as rocks. They appreciate Trump's leadership? The person who was calling the illness a hoax a few days ago? I guess they will keep believing that until they or one of their loved ones contracts COVID-19. And calling people who call out racism ""social justice panderers"". SMH."

While the poem does use sexually explicit language, it's more to convey a larger point rather than talking about dicks and viagra.

This poem is more for high schoolers imo."

There's a whole conversation to be had about how much kids should be sheltered in school, but I really can't imagine the poem being taught in school even if it weren't about anti-Asian racism. My 9th grade poetry unit's most controversial poem was a fighter pilot poem apparently about abortion. 

It's pretty cool to incorporate modern poetry into lesson plans though.

How any Asians in America can support the absolute trash of the Trump administration is beyond me."
1,j747pv,"When this first started and Trump was calling it China Virus and other names, I saw the take that ""he wants to set the branding to avoid the blame, rather than actually doing anything about the virus"" around a lot. It's intensely clear now that that was true, and that's always been the plan."
2,j747pv,"Man, once I hear ""holding china accountable"" it's just such a huge red flag and 99% of the time it's just deflection and dogwhistling. Like what the hell is that even supposed to mean? Apparently to his base it means ""go attack the next asian grandma you see."" The only people who need to be ""held accountable"" are trump and his minions for completely fucking up the covid response even when they had tons of resources, a 3 month head start compared to countries like Vietnam that didn't have that luxury but still handled it far better, and the best scientists at their disposal. 

It's hella frustrating explaining how the *intention* sometimes matters just as much as what you're saying when it comes to racist rhetoric. With all those people saying bUt wHaT aBoUt ChInA whenever there's news about a gramma getting brutally attacked."

And I mean, at the end of the day, what does anyone really get out of calling it the ""Chinese virus""? Like, I see some folks defend this to *DEATH* and it just doesn't make sense. Like, ok. You have the right to offend. No one's gonna jail you for it. But why would you purposefully go out of your way to offend people? Like, your actions have real-world consequences, and those consequences are readily visible. Friends of mine know people who have been beaten up due to this xenophobia. It's not some ""harmless"" act to call it that, and it's not unintentional, either.

1,kflq4c,"Fellow Asians. *SPEAK. UP.* 

Inform yourself of international policies and events, domestic issues, and learning how to identify and (appropriately) counteract prejudiced actions toward you or a fellow Asian person. Have a voice when socioeconomic issues are discussed because we don't have enough representation that accurately defines how our struggles have been through all the hell. I can't stress enough: *Get informed*.

East, Southeast, South, Central, western, SWANA--it DOESN'T MATTER. We each have different levels of deep racism that we face, and while they're NOT not, not, equal, the way we are treated is more often than not out of what is taught and ingrained into society. Your speaking up means they know more and at the very least, have that information in the back of their heads, even if they want to continue being racist.

I'm tired of hearing statistics that fail to account for Asians during COVID-19. We make up small percentages of the population, yet so many of us that weren't blessed with ""model minority"" gifts (read: Asian families that have found monetary success and represent the ideal that we're *all* doing well-off) are especially hit hardest in cities like:

[New York City](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/ncna1251457)

[San Francisco](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/nation/2020/10/18/coronavirus-asian-americans-racism-death-rates-san-francisco/5799617002/)

Or are part of these kind of morbid numbers: 

[State-by-State Statistics](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1133288/coronavirus-covid19-death-rate-white-asian-by-state-us/)

[Data from AAPI](https://aapidata.com/covid19/)

*These are death rates, btw.*

Even if our numbers are lower, we have higher percentages of death per infected. If you're too lazy to read, the AAPI has pretty charts to see this.

I don't know about you but I don't like being near people, period. Germs gross me out (I happened to work in, and studied microbiology). I know a lot of my Asian friends are like me too. We're clean, even if we don't have degrees in health or natural sciences. The folks from overseas are likely wearing masks due to learning from SARS. If our numbers are low, think about the different behaviors and measures we are taking from other groups.

Think about the frail elderly Asian lady who searches for bottles to recycle (outside of the pandemic), wearing gloves (at least the ones I see). Think about the restaurant owners who have nothing to fall back on, and are keeping open to stay alive, but have stringent standards of cleanliness to keep safe. Think about the multi-generational housing that exist. If anything, our problems are being under reported due to mixed instances of *lack of representation*. Despite having low resources, our cultures tend to lean toward taking care of our own, keeping good hygiene (eating with right hand? Anybody?), and spending the money to protect ourselves. 

Sure I may have a biased lens here, but more often than not the people who are getting COVID-19 *have* fewer resources they're possibly not asking for (or can't afford to get help in the first place), or as the article mentioned, is not available in their language. Find ways to close these gaps.

It is NOT shameful to ask for help. *Be a goddamn disruptor.*

Thanks for reading, if you did.

> The Los Angeles of 1871 was a violent, lawless place.

> Historians have described it as one of the last cities to establish civil law enforcement institutions, relying instead on vigilante justice and mob rule.

> It also was a place notorious for its mistreatment and exploitation of Black, Asian, Latino and Native Californians at the hands of white settlers. But the venom against Chinese Americans was particularly poisonous, fueled by editorials in the Los Angeles News that attacked them as “barbarians taking jobs away from whites.”

> “Los Angeles in 1871 was a dirty, violent city of nearly 6,000 people. Though the city had a higher homicide rate than New York or Chicago, it employed only six police officers to maintain law and order. Lynchings and mob justice were commonplace,” the Los Angeles Public Library wrote.

> It was this world 150 years ago that spawned the Chinese Massacre, a bloody siege that brought shame to Los Angeles and sparked widespread changes in the way the city operated. But it did little to alter the core racism that Asians and other groups would continue to endure."
1,m7wnno,"The book [Driven Out](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=11825013) is a good resource for learning more about the history of massacres and purges of Chinese communities in the US. In towns that didn't resort to mass murder, what often happened instead was White mobs destroying Chinese homes and businesses and literally carting, marching, shipping Chinese people out of town.

>Prof. PFAELZER: In many towns, a day was picked. In Tacoma, Washington, one morning in February 1886, nine o'clock in the morning, all of the whistles at the foundries and factories go off right at the same time and, four hours later, the Chinese are gone. The vigilantes had been notified that it is now okay to rout Chinatown.  
>  
>And they come into Chinatown, they raid the stores, they pull the material, the food, the rice, the furniture, the china that was so highly valued at the time, pulled into the streets; load the Chinese up. The women who have bound feet are thrown into carts because they can't walk. And they send them on a forced nine-mile march up to a railroad crossing they had actually built. And there, they wait for a train because to take them…

>MARTIN: And where were they supposed to go?  
>  
>Prof. PFAELZER: You know, they were supposed to leave. Where they went was often up to them. From a north coast town called Eureka, California, they were put on steamships down to San Francisco. From Tacoma, Washington, most of them marched the 140 miles following the railroad tracks down to Portland, Oregon, from a little down called Crescent City. As each lumber ship came week by week by week, they were rounded up and loaded on to, as many as could, onto lumber ships.

Some were dragged through the streets with ropes around their necks and hanged from a wooden awning over a sidewalk, a covered wagon or the crossbeam of a corral gate. Finally, 15 corpses — including those of a 14-year-old boy and the Chinese community’s only physician, Chee Long Tong — dangled in the City of the Angels. Four others died from gunshot wounds, bringing the death toll at the hands of the mob to 19 — 10% of the city’s tiny Chinese population.

5,m19b0j,"PHOENIX (KPHO/KTVK) - The family of a 74-year-old Asian man who was killed believes he was the victim of a hate crime.

Police have a suspect in custody but said they don’t have evidence of that motive.

Phoenix Police said Juanito Falcon was walking when a man attacked him for no apparent reason. His family says they want justice.

“I’m deeply sad. I’m scared, and I’m devastated, and of course I feel angry,” Jacklyn Lozada said.

“You took a very special person away from us, and he had so many more years to give and so much more love,” Lozada said.

Court documents say Marcus Williams punched Juanito Falcon until he fell to the ground, “striking his head on the pavement.”

The 74-year-old died two days later, and police arrested Williams for second-degree murder.

Although investigators say they don’t have any evidence the victim was targeted for his race, Falcon’s niece, Lysander Lanuza, believes otherwise.

“Being Asian that he is, I believe he was specifically targeted,” she said.

With so many mysteries surrounding Falcon’s death, the family is keeping their focus on the loving legacy he left behind.

“We always felt loved by him. we always felt safe, and he always made us smile,” Lozada said."

4,fwtp5a,"The virus would've gotten there either way. 

People move across the globe. The symptoms don't always manifest immediately. It's highly contagious.

Poor containment methods, anti-science people, and people thinking ""oh, it won't affect me"" certainly don't help its spread.

Even with our technology today, we, as a species, have to understand that pathogens aren't something to be joked about: like us, they're living beings. They can mutate and evolve to adapt to their surroundings and infect other hosts. 

You can sanitize your hands. There will still be some bacteria left over, and it will be stronger than the other bacteria which died. 

Viruses are even worse in this regard: they're not technically living things, and therefore, once you have it, you can't just take antibiotics and be fine. Even a vaccine just makes your body aware of its presence so it's on-the-ready if and when you get it. It doesn't guarantee that you won't get sick.

A virus is a virus. Its sole purpose is to infect the cells of healthy organisms to reproduce and spread. It does not discriminate and it knows no demographic.

Making this an ""us-vs-them"" situation helps no one. The virus isn't going to go away just because you hate Chinese people. It's not going to magically disappear overnight.

The best way people can stop this pandemic is to listen to the health guidelines given out by organizations like the CDC.

I've had so many people treat me poorly, like I was the lowest thing on earth, including doctors, therapists, professors, bus drivers, strangers, employees anywhere, etc. And the same people are instantly nice and respectful when they interact with someone else a second later. 

SF is pathetically bougie and full of smug hipsters, and they look down on many Asians - way down. Asians born or raised in the US look way down on many Asians, too. 

It doesn't help that SF has Chinatown and at least 3 ""new Chinatowns"" with ugly immigrant stores that give people the reputation that Asians are lowbrow, backwards filth. They think those represent all Asians. In fact, China, Taiwan, HK, Singapore, and other Asian countries are so much more clean, technologically advanced, and civilized than the US. 

And the significant population of elderly, working-class Asians in SF gives Asians a bad perception in SF, too. They make people think all Asians are like that - and there's nothing wrong with the elderly working-class, either. 

Asians are seriously the most discriminated against, stereotyped, hated group in SF."

2,djnsd8,"I don't know how well this will work (whether abusers will just abuse Korean women instead) but it certainly seems good in principle and a step in the right direction.

It would be nice if the west took measures against this type of abuse in our countries too."
3,djnsd8,"Women in S. Korea, increasingly don’t want to marry, which is fine whether it be because they have their own careers or because they don’t like the scrubs that are available.  So many men turn to bringing in wives from Vietnam, China or the Philippines, amongst other countries.  They also abuse them at an alarming rate.  I’m assuming this may be an issue in China as well, as a fallout of their one child policy.

I am unsure if this will result in a higher rate of abuse amongst Korean women, because, they weren’t dating these men to begin with anyway.  And obtaining a foreign bride was the only option available.

That’s not to say that it won’t manifest itself in other forms of abuse.  But specifically, I don’t see the rates increase in Korean male/Korean female pairings, if Korean females aren’t entering into the relationships to begin with.

Unfortunately I would see the rates rising in other relationships that are not defined in Korea as marriages."

On this day in 2009, Judy Chu was elected as the first Chinese American woman to serve in the U.S. Congress. She represents California’s current 27th congressional district. A California native, Chu grew up in the LA area before her family moved to the San Francisco Bay area. She attended UCLA, studying mathematics, and then pursued a Ph.D. in psychology. Chu taught psychology at a community college for about twenty years before getting involved in local government. She has served on school boards and city councils and was mayor of Monterey Park for three terms. Chu was next elected into the State Assembly, serving for two terms. Then, in 2009, a successful campaign landed her in the U.S. House of Representatives where she still works today.  

In 2011, Chu was elected as Chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. This group advocates for AAPI across the nation. As Chair, she also helps lead the Tri-Caucus (also made up of the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus); this conglomerate supports and voices the needs and concerns of the nation’s minority groups. 

In 2012, Chu introduced a resolution by which the House would formally apologize for the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and other laws that wrongfully discriminated against Chinese Americans. An apology was never received, but a ""statement of regret"" passed after only 10 days in committee."

Of course Kpop labels are doing that to appeal to a wider audience and not for selfless reasons, but at the same time it's a result of discrimination against Asians in the Western music industry.

9,tqm3cv,"You’re not wrong, but I found this post funny because growing up I always marveled at how MANY Asians were on Grey’s Anatomy! Sandra Oh was a main character for the first several seasons, they addressed the racism her character dealt with (way back in like 2005 and 2006!), there are several recurring background characters who are Asian, they often had patients who were Asian…sometimes their cultural practices or immigrant status would play into their treatment…like yes, the cast is mostly white and there should realistically be more Asians in this setting, but it still felt like more representation than I was seeing from any other major network programming as a teen."

15,tqm3cv,"Not as large a number as you may hope for, there are three Asian women in various roles in the show this season.  Dr Lin was hired by Baily at the start of the season.  From IMDB data, the character has been in four episodes.  One of the current group of residents is Asian.  She has been in 17 episodes since last year.  Nurse Bokhee is a scrub nurse who has been seen in GA's ORs since 2005.  She is played by Bokhee An who is a scrub nurse IRL."
16,tqm3cv,"I think in order for that to happen Hollywood needs to have more Asians doing the writing and directing. For generations we’ve been pushed to certain careers, and dismissed the creative fields. It’s really not until the recent couple of generations that we have collectively embraced the value of the arts. And while it’s understandable the history of Asian parents urging their children to go into careers as doctors and engineers because there’s a higher chance for success, it’s time we flood the place with more storytellers. We need people who look and live like us to write and tell the stories. As someone in marketing I always notice how decision makers are mostly white, and whenever they try to pick a spokesperson or someone to reference as a character, it will always be white unless they’re specifically targeting a certain demographic. In order for that to change we have to have people get to the decision making levels. We also have to consciously support the arts when there is a chance to. Not just the blockbusters, but the independent ones too."
17,tqm3cv,"So when the show was still in concept they did a colorblind casting.

Basically the characters were written, hashed out, and made without race in mind.

Back then not a lot of Asian representation was obviously shown, not like today.

21,tqm3cv,"There's a lot more black doctors and nurses, a lot more Indian doctors and nurses, and a lot more Asian docs and nurses as well in real life than shown from medical dramas. Also doctors don't do this much shit in a hospital. In relative terms of patient care, cast majority of doctors spend like 5 minutes with a patient for the whole day and find every excuse to never drop their heads back in. A lot more male nurses.

The problem is Hollywood seeks to fill staff using quotas. The token minorities of the cast to be inclusive and the rest are validations of white archetypes are the center of the universe."
22,tqm3cv,"Damn, Grey's is almost 20 years old 🤯

Hey, I'm Black. The show began in I think 2004 and was created by a Black woman. Black professionals were underrepresented on TV then (and still are) and I think it was her mission to ""fix"" that through her own creation with actual three dimensional Black characters. She also created Scandal, at the time the first network TV show staring a Black woman in about 40 years. I remember watching one episode of Grey's and seeing four of the Black doctors standing in a room going over a case and realizing I'd never seen that on TV.

I agree there should be more Asian rep fs (the Asian and Latine characters they have besides Cristina and Callie in the past few years have been pretty one note/around for a much shorter time than other cast members). Still, when the show was good (it's on its last legs) I think it was a show created by a Black woman who wanted to showcase positive Black representation (during the Bush-Obama era) and that's okay."

In fact, in Cho's entire career, he has not once played a character with a fake accent.

Reminds me of a story that Bobby Lee tells of John Cho. I'll paraphrase. 

Bobby Lee and John Cho were on set together and John Cho goes to Bobby Lee's trailer to use his bathroom. An assistant comes to give Bobby Lee some medicine he asked for. The assistant says in a stereotypical Asian accent, ""Here's your medicine, Mr. Lee."" 

Suddenly, John Cho storms out of the trailer and says to the assistant, ""Apologize to him. And if you still want your job, you better not do that again."""

While it should not be a prequisite that every prominent AAPI role on screen have an asian accent, it also should not be a prequisite that every Asian American actor on screen sounds like an americanized asian kid from california, which a lot of AAPI actors are. like be doesnt want kids growing up thinking their accent is a joke, but for kids who do have accents, it would be nice to see Asians on screens that have accents but aren’t complete jokes. a serious, 3D character that sounds like them would help normalize them

In other words, i think the various accents in the AAPI community should be celebrated, rather than ridiculed, or be the butt of a joke. but of course that would take putting more Asians in charge of telling their own stories."

>More research needs to be done to address the disparities within the Asian American community. A research brief [published on Health Affairs](https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20200708.894552/full/)  reported that Asian Americans appeared to have a fatality rate from  COVID-19 four times higher than that of the overall population. The  article noted, however, that this result could be due to **inadequate data  on Asian Americans, and lack of standardization on the ethnicities  counted as Asian American.** Recently, [Pacific Islanders have been found](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-07-19/california-pacific-islander-native-hawaiian-communities-hit-hard-by-coronavirus) to suffer the highest infection rate of any racial or ethnic group in Los Angeles County, but the data remain limited.

>Dr. Tung Nguyen, endowed chair in general internal medicine and  professor of medicine at UC San Francisco, co-authored the article. He  said **disaggregating data on Asian Americans was one of the first steps  to addressing health disparities among communities of color.** “At best,  it should be disaggregated by Asian American national origin group, and  primary language,” Nguyen said. “And then they should also invest  efforts in collecting data so that there is a minimum amount of  unknowns, because it is really hard to clarify disparities when there’s a  big group of people who we don’t know anything about at all.”"

*Transcription below:*

""Asian Americans are rendered invisible through both external forces of invisibility and internal forces of invisibility. Which combine to create what I call ""toxic invisibility."" And here's a real world example of how that works. Let's talk business.

Externally, we face something called the ""bamboo ceiling"" which is a phenomenon where Asian Americans are routinely overlooked for leadership roles. I believe the three main reasons for this are:

1. We're perceived as a perpetual foreigner, which means that we are not deserving of all the rewards that should go to true Americans.
2. We're perceived as a monolith, a nameless, faceless, mass of people who lack individuality. Which is why white people are always forgetting our names and mixing us up with other Asians.
3. We're also perceived as a model minority. Which is the myth that we're doing just fine. That we don't experience any racial discrimination and therefore aren't in need of any equitable treatment. And it also makes people believe that we are quiet and submissive and won't complain.

Now the internal forces that render us invisible are both cultural and psychological.

Culturally, we're taught a bunch of things that go against corporate culture.

1. Respect your elders. We're taught to always give our difference to people who are older than us or who hold positions of authority over us.
2. Our cultures also promote group harmony over individual needs. Which means that we are always putting other people's needs over our own.
3. Related to that are the cultural rules surrounding conversation itself. A lot of our cultures promote politeness in conversation which means only speaking only when spoken to, never speaking out of turn, and to interrupt someone or to speak loudly over someone is considered the height of rudeness.
4. Also considered rude is to brag about oneself. We're taught to be modest, humble, and to show that modesty and humility by deflecting compliments whenever they come.

So you can see already we're at a huge cultural disadvantage as many of these cultural traits are the complete opposite of corporate culture.

Let's talk about the psychological forces of invisibility. As a result of a lot of inter-generational trauma, we deal with a lot of guilt, shame, and criticism, which lowers our self-esteem. and when you have low self-esteem you're less likely to speak up, speak out, or even believe that you deserve a promotion.

Also being the victim of constant racial trauma means that we move through this world with a lot of fear. This makes us avoid negative attention and makes us less likely to stick our necks out and to take risks. These days, we literally have to look over our shoulders just walking down the street.

Now, put all that together and what do you get? While we represent 13% of the US professional workforce we are only 6% or executive roles. This means that we are losing out on actual dollars we could be earning. We are putting in more work and getting less out of that work than others are. All because of toxic invisibility."""
2,tlbmcg,So happy to see this. 100% agree and experience this every day. Hope we can make some changes soon.
3,tlbmcg,Well said. Often times this toxic invisibility leads to selfloathing and internalized racism
4,tlbmcg,Yes we can do this. First we need to learn to say no and learn to speak up. It’s hard at first and most of the time you’ll be ignored by our colleagues. We have to “break all the rules” our parents taught us growing up and face racism head on while at work. What he mentioned about work invisibility is what I’ve dealt with 2 years ago.
5,tlbmcg,"Preach on brother.  I definitely hit the bamboo ceiling… sigh.  Recently though, I decided to change careers and do something that even if I never get into a leadership role I will be happy.  Thanks for sharing."
6,tlbmcg,This just proves how insulting it is when so called anti racist activists say Asians are “white adjacent”
7,tlbmcg,I wish he'd just call it racism instead of coining a new phrase
8,tlbmcg,"Wow, I needed to see this. I always felt like I was just forgotten with any job I had. I could never understand why. I felt like I could get away with anything in any position I had."

0,k6p2sy,"I think there's a segment of the Chinese-American population that have the attitude of ""White people will always be racist against us.  There is nothing that can be done to change that, so I'll just go for the lower taxes.""

Also, Affirmative Action.  There are quite a few Chinese-Americans who hate affirmative action, to the point of single-issue voting."
1,k6p2sy,"That's an easy question. If someone is a Chinese Republican, they're probably:

1. Support law and order
1. Lean culturally/politically conservative
1. Don't like taxes
1. Distrustful of the government
1. Working class or own a small business
1. First generation Asian American
1. Anti-communist 

It could be one or a combination of these factors. #2 and #3 are more obvious reasons of why a Chinese person would throw in with the Republican Party.

But even though the current administration is proto-fascist and doesn't actually care about the working class, what they're very good at is constantly signaling that they do. The Democrats are bad at this and, since they're largely run by white people or minorities that have grown up in bougie white spaces, their messaging is only attractive precisely to that audience: white liberals and bougie POC who probably have mostly white liberal friends.

Jay Kang wrote specifically about [this](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/20/opinion/sunday/immigrants-vote-election-politics.html). The Democratic Party's messaging to POC (but not white Democrats) is always about how there is this hierarchy of grievances where Black people and their concerns are at the top and everyone else is an afterthought. 

That messaging works for a lot of Asian Americans. After all, it's definitely true that life as an Asian American is far less dangerous than being Black.

But it doesn't mean shit to a bike courier in Sunset Park who just immigrated from Shandong like four years ago. The term ""Asian American"" is meaningless to him and the idea that he should feel impassioned about Black Lives Matter even if he might feel bad for Black people is ludicrous to him. Why should he care? It's not like Black people are expected to put their weight behind the concerns of Chinese immigrant deliverymen.

So what does he care about? Probably working hard to build a successful life, not getting mugged, and Sinophobia. Republicans have great messaging for the first two things. As for the last, virtually all the protests and methods to organized have been focused on us — that is to say, Asian Americans who are second generation or higher. Everything is done in English.

Where are the Chinese speaking groups organizing about this? The Hindi groups? The Vietnamese? They exist of course but there's a lot fewer of them and, more importantly, they don't get any press or platform.

The Democrat approach to building this rainbow coalition of diverse people is silly because they don't actually offer anything to any group that isn't highly visible to white people. If you aren't Black or the bougie kid of immigrants, the Democrat message isn't very attractive. It's based on vague liberal ideals about why we should be nicer people and not pragmatism.

For all their faults, Republicans are actually very good at messaging for the latter. Their entire platform revolves around pragmatism: making money, staying safe, and keeping your taxes low.

As Jay said in his piece, the great arrogance of the Democrats is believing that POC (including Asian Americans) will flock to the party just because they aren't white. Democrats don't think they have to work for the Asian American vote by offering Asian Americans (including poor immigrants) actual, pragmatic policies that we specifically (not Black people, not ""POC"") care about.

The one super strong card that Democrats have right now is sanctuary cities but it's always framed as a ""look how virtuous the Democratic Party is because we care about immigrants"" and not ""we want you to join the Democratic Party because we're protecting you and the Republicans are trying to kick you out"". The sanctuary city policy is always framed by the Democrats as a policy they adopted to win woke votes when it should be framed as a policy done to win immigrant votes.

This idea that ""of course everyone who isn't white would logically hate the Republican Party"" is itself an example of how bad we are, as a people and as a country, at talking about race. It's still stuck in a Black or white binary. Essentially, you're boiling Asian American identity into trying to decide if we're honorary Black people or honorary white people.

We aren't viewing ourselves as a unique group who don't fit this simplistic classification of race which is determined by how ""white"" or how ""Black"" you are."

I grew up in Honolulu during the 1940s-1950s and WW2 had left bitter feelings against people of Japanese extraction in town because of Pearl Harbor and the subsequent Pacific war.  I remember being yelled and cursed at and called a Jap anywhere in town including playgrounds, churches etc.  Hawaii's politics were overwhelmingly dominated by Republicans in those years backed by the management of the 'Big 5' industrial companies that dominated Hawaii's economy in those years.  These were the companies that ran the agricultural, shipping and retail life of Hawaii.  There were blatant anti-Japanese biases in that business environment even tho Hawaii's population was made up of about 1/3 Japanese ethnics.  Because of the Republican dominance in this enrionment, I grew up determined to be a Democrat and volunteered for numerous Democrat sponsored causes.  When WW2 ended and our war heroes, the famous 442nd and 100th Infantries returned to Hawaii with their numerous war medals and commendations for valor, these men turned their attention to alter the face of Hawaii's politics and started running for pollitical office as Democrats to turn power over to the common folk of Hawaii instead of the Business Establishment. They succeeded in a big way."

11,k6p2sy,"For the same reason why Cuban-Americans are often Republicans - there's a deep-seated fear of communism/socialism prevalent in both communities and many GOP members spread the narrative that the Democratic Party is going to bring communism to America.  Many Chinese- and Cuban-Americans love the GOP's open and undiplomatic cudgeling of their ancestral land's contemporary government to the point where it overrides all other issues. 

It should also be noted that given neither Democrats nor Republicans are monolithic groups, many don't think they necessarily support the behaviour of other of their party members by voting for them."

17,k6p2sy,"Not sure this has been said, but a similar reason hispanics can support Trump. It is a mix of classism (i'm not one of THOSE low class trash people) and it's a way you make yourself whiter. Keep Black people at the bottom, shit on them, and make sure you are better off than them.

Like Irish cops in New York policing Italian and Blacks poors. Or concentration camp guys, there was always gonna be ppl who will gladly take better privileges to keep other people down.

Think of it as a difference in philosophy. They believe by doing THAT course and siding with the whites they will become honorary whites. Like you know, Jewish people.

Now for more local issues, in New York City... we have these specialized public schools in NYC that need tests to enter. They are similar to the SATs. They are prestigious schools and a good portion of students go to ivy leagues.

The problem is there's only like 1% black students in them. So the recent administration wants to change that. The problem is that the Chinese/Koreans hate that because they currently make up roughly half the student body (also Indians but I don't have any recent numbers on student body). The minorities fight each other for a few spots for their perceived interests.

My parents don’t want to pay taxes for government programs they won’t ever need. They are strongly against affirmative action, a democratic proposal that masks as beneficial to all POC, but blatantly racist against Asians. In the end, both sides are racists towards Asians, but at least conservative policies are beneficial to most of us. At least, that’s how my parents and a lot of the people in my community see it.

22,k6p2sy,[deleted]
23,k6p2sy,"That's funny you say that because most Chinese I've met who've come from China and live in Southern California have leaned Republican to having been outright Trump supporters. The recent Chinese immigrants tend to be from the north (Shandong/HeiLongJiang) compared to the Chinese who've settled here earlier (Guangdong/Fujian/Wenzhou). Many of the recent Chinese converted or have become born again Christians, but that's been the type of person I've come across in my 30 years here. I'd say it's the suburban environment, that many Chinese own small businesses, and their religious background make reliable republicans. I didn't encounter a left leaning Chinese American population until I entered college. And it makes sense. Asia is far more culturally conservative than the US, and for most ordinary bystanders, that matches with the conservative parties in the US (despite the negative rhetoric towards groups). 

The Taishanese/Cantonese people tend to be apolitical and never discuss politics. The Taiwanese I know lean Republican. The Vietnamese Chinese I know, the older generation is Republican, the newer generation is moderate/left. That's not to say most Asian Americans here are conservative. The ones who didn't convert to Catholicism, Protestantism are left leaning. I only mention the North/South Chinese divide earlier because it appears that Southern Chinese are more likely to hold on to Chinese religious traditions (within and outside of China).

But it's all just generalizations. One of the more fanatical people who chastised me (""Heathens deserve to burn in Hell"") for being irreligious in high school was a home schooled taishanese kid whose father ran a church. I think he finished up his masters degree in theology now.

In all, I think my experience with minorities who vote for the Republican Party, is that they don't view themselves as member of an ethnic group: they view themselves as individuals first and foremost. I think this messaging has been very effective in carving out political power from a group of people, IMO, who would be better off not voting for the Republican Party (unless they're a small business owner). Thinking of themselves as individuals means that the negative rhetoric does not apply to them personally so they do not take offense. For first-generation immigrants in the Chinese community, they left China for a reason, and in particular identify with being American, compared with their peers who remained. 

I know that the Chinese chamber of commerce who had endorsed for Trump in 2016, went on record to give a no endorsement this election year because they saw how poorly COVID has been managed under Trump (just an absolute lack of preparedness). I think that's been apparent for both left/right sides of politics, but particularly under Trump, the US record has been abysmal, and any lockdown should have been tied to federal aid (and lockdowns tied to ICU bed capacity). So I can't imagine how so many would want to re-elect Trump this year, or anyone worrying about federal deficits during a pandemic/emergency.

Trying to be neutral as possible. I am a moderate politically, and have voted for the GOP in the past. Personally not a Trump fan, but I can understand some aspects of his campaign in 2016 (end war, tough borders, get real with China). The separation from the cultural wars waged in the past was refreshing. Not 2020, though."

2. Money - less taxes/tax cuts for their income bracket/ you know the usual

It's not even the well off Chinese/Asian Americans who believe, I grew up in a working class family and I'm pretty much the only one who votes Democrat. I'll be honest here as long as the Democrats push Affirmative Action hard for other minorities while ignoring the huge income disparity within the Asian American community as a whole pretending that we all can somehow afford weekly piano and violin lessons, affirmative is  very effective wedge to drive a large number of Asian voters towards the republicans."

&#x200B;

When you own your own small business and bust your ass to make a living, any talk of ""racial justice, reparations, etc"" is not going to resonate.  And many Asian American small business owners are  located in predominantly poor black neighborhoods so the only experience they have with Black people is negative.  So they don't have the breadth of perspective or background to understand where other people are coming from or how racism against other minorities affects them.

Asians also come from countries where protests are not allowed...there is no sense of ""civic duty"".  

If any of you have ever listened to Ali Wong's comedy, she has a joke where she says:

***""Dating a white guy can be hot....they teach you about a lot of stuff....like VOTING, or RECYCLING"".***

The kernal of truth in that joke which makes it funny is that Asians are not civic-minded.  Our parents don't participate in PTA meetings, or volunteer at soup kitchens or coach Little League....none of that stuff."

51,k6p2sy,"I live in New York which doesn't make me an expert on asian Americans but it does give me a lot of anecdotal data. Im not well informed about the Japanese, Thai, Laos, and many more as most of the ones I know are rich kid international students so it doesn't really count. their population in the USA is actually pretty small overall so this list might not really apply. Perpetually foreigners also plays a huge role but im not studied enough to really speak of it. This list is anecdotal and its filled with my own biases as well so don't take it as if I'm speaking with utmost certainty 

1. hates trans genders. this one is way more common that I would have expected. they are often homophobic but usually they dont really care about gays and lesbians its the transgenders that they really hate. the general homophobia is the biggest thing probably because while lgbtq exists in asia it is hidden in plain sight just like it used to be in america. to call someone out as lgbtq is immoral but to be open about it is as. It's associated with the dark side of humanity throughout asian history but the fact that its being legitimized is a big nono to them. Remember most people in general are not lgbtq and immigrant communities are much more insular. many of them can open their eyes to their biases against blacks who make up a large portion of the population but its much more unlikely for an older immigrant who has a hard time truly understanding the English language to interact with the lgbtq community. 

2. overall racism towards blacks (not really african immigrants) this one is more nuanced because just like white people its more of the bias and not the outright hatred that allows them to justify it. Often times Asian and black relations within new york are very tense. Most Asian Americans lose the outright racism as they grow up but biases often remain. 

3. sometimes its just economic policies that they more align with. this one is iffy because usually they are pretty misinformed due to the language barrier and just like fox News watcher ls they get a lot a lot of misinformation if they only get it from a few sources

4. Religion Koreans are much more likely to be Christian than not due to the religion being normalized in their home country and the community building ir creates (chinese and Japanese can be too but its way less percentage wise) their Christian sects tend to be part of institutions that are usually right leaning.

5. The pandemic really really stirred them up this is the biggest one. usually green card holders will usually become citizens but still have a hard time getting skilled jobs due to coming to the USA in adulthood and the sheer difficulty of learning English coming from an Asian country as an adult is just too hard. Asians prioritize job security heavily and the pandemic lock down has thrown a massive wrench into this allowing for misinformation and a general dislike of the democrats who are often blamed for the lock down and poor management of the coronavirus. The CCP is what they came here to avoid, so they perceive heavy government intervention as a destruction of their American dream

6. if you think boomers say pull up from bootstraps a lot you ain't heard fucking shit yet from an Asian 

7. overall hatred of government handouts even if they abuse them heavily. asians will take your ""charity"" and call you a fool. ironically China korea Japan Phillipines have subsidized health care but they often hate it here ? this one is really really weird tbh they have varying opinions. China and Phillipines tend to be distrustful due to believing their home countries system sucks. but koreans have by far the best health care in the world even if they do also do believe some weird Chinese medicine bullshit sometimes. im not informed about Japanese enough to say anything.

8. Tend to be uneducated on government and society but have a lot of hard opinions on both

9. General feeling of if life is going to be super unfair to them they will remove themselves from the narrative

10. feeling victimized as asians and not having and solution besides be successful.  

Most Asian Americans are fairly tolerant BUT hold major biases that play out when they are pushed just like anyone else

Asian Immigrants turned citizens are pretty much falling into the same trap as boomers plus they are even easier to misinform due to language barriers and overall mindset. 

Overall I would say. Corona really fucked with peoples minds on both sides of the political spectrum, and the current political environment is really making things heated"

I'd arranged to meet one of my kendo Sensei, whose research I was editing in English, at a coffee shop for a few hours of work.  He was only about six years older than I was, and I was sort of friends with him, when I could get over being in awe of his physical skill; he'd introduce me to people as his ""English Sensei."" On this particular afternoon he'd forgot his umbrella, and when the time came to say goodbye for the day, we stood under the awning for a couple of minutes, looking for a break in the rain.

Me: ""Sensei, you should take my umbrella! I've only got to go to the bus stop, right there, and then the bus lets off 300 feet from my house.""

Sensei: ""Oh, no, no, I could not, no."" \*beat\* ""Wow, so rain.""

Me: ""Seriously, Sensei. Please take my umbrella. I don't mind getting soaked when it's warm out, you have things to do, I can just go home and dry off and watch TV for the rest of the day.""

Sensei: ""No, no, you are my student. I could not. Is not appropriate."" \*thirty second pause\* ""This rain! So, wow, so bad!""

Me, laughing now: ""SENSEI! Please take my  umbrella! You're going to be soaked and you have hours more to be at work! I am going to go home, take a shower, and sit around in my pajamas!""

Sensei: \*visibly struggling\*

Me: \*shoves umbrella at him\*

Sensei: \*takes it\* ""But is so rain! You will wet your hair! Are you sure?""

Me: ""That is literally my bus right there please walk me to the stop so I don't miss it and then please take my umbrella!""

1,fuwqqs,"Exactly this:

> “The article brought back memories of elders telling us how they were instructed by organizations to be ‘good Americans,’ when just being American should have been enough,” one Japanese American leader said."
2,fuwqqs,"I agree with the Japanese American leaders quoted in this article. Yang's piece, particularly the section everyone is critiquing is definitely off the mark and beyond unhelpful. The individuals expressing their views in this piece and others sounding off on social media should absolutely do so.

However, I am skeptical of how mainstream news outlets have chosen to amplify this internal discord and fixate on Yang's piece instead of actually reporting on the central issue of racism against Asians in the west. Papers are eager to publish articles and op-eds criticizing Yang but where is the reporting on hate crimes against Asians or the editorials condemning violence and racism?

To put it bluntly, this hyperfocus on Yang's piece is a distraction and deflection from the actions of racists who are out there racially abusing Asians and either have no idea what Yang said or are laughing at our internal bickering. Look, obviously we should call out what was wrong with Yang's piece, but we also need to ask ourselves why critiquing him is getting so much traction in the media which usually ignores him and AsAms.

Racist abuse and assault have happened to Japanese Americans in recent months. Where was NBC to report on these attacks and interview these community leaders then?"
3,fuwqqs,"This ""if I study hard and follow the law, racists will leave me alone"" mindset is how racism agains Asians continues to get normalized. And why the community is perceived as an easy target. I'm glad he's getting called out for it and I hope he learns from this criticism. For better or worse, he's a prominent Asian American voice in politics now. Primary season is over. You don't have to give a wink to extremely-online frat bros and incels anymore, Andrew."
4,fuwqqs,"I initially supported Yang but what he said here kinda proves Yang is fake and a sell out. I normally don't go ""Bro you're a sellout, you no longer have my support..."" But people don't like fake ass people. The idea that you need to conform yourself to the identity Americans want us to be is exactly that. He's literally telling us to be fake and keep being fake until you're ultimately so subservient, you are the literal prejudiced stereotype of being the good little Asian bitch the racists perpetuate.

Now I still kind of support Yang's politics but this is also why Asians are ""praised"" in stereotype but never fully accepted as Americans even today. It's really not a competition but people who are black/Latino can be accepted as being American. Meanwhile not so much for Asians even if you're born in Denver or New Orleans or NYC. You have minority groups or former minorities who went through the same thing not recognizing this which also proves a lot of people lack critical thinking.

The most respected acts of defiance among Asians in America are the Rooftop Koreans who took up arms and protected themselves against those that would steal from us when no one would protect us. Take heed. I'm not advocating for us to all buy guns and start shooting everyone. We don't need an Asian George Zimmerman. But we need for the older conservative Asians and 1st generation immigrants who bend over backwards for assholes to stop or at least stop trying to make other Asians conform to your ideals as well. If you want to bend over backwards that's your own choice. People may end up liking you as a convenient token Asian guy but they won't respect you much."

7,fuwqqs,"A mod told me to take my thoughts here: 

My god, how despicably tone deaf.

Literally any autobiography about internment has *chapters* dedicated to the countless creative efforts the family exhausted in trying to prove they were ""American"", as rising anti-japanese sentiment led to imprisonment. 

It did NOTHING. 

It didn't matter that JA families *felt* American, or that they'd been there for generations, and it didn't matter if they couldn't even speak Japanese. Or the many sacrifices they made to try to show their *community* that they were loyal to America. 

They were other. They were foreign. They were the enemy. 

And therefore imprisoned. 

The lesson to be learned, in every one of these books, is that we cannot let skin deep prejudices perpetuate these injustices. We cannot imprison people for their race, and we should not treat people like they are a pathogen based on their race! **It's not this victim-blamey attitude that Andrew Yang seems to hold--that these families didn't do enough to prove they were American.**

This dude needs to read a fucking book if he's claiming to speak for ""Asian Americans"". 

I'm sorry, but Andrew Yang has shown his true colors. He's clearly more concerned about pandering to white America, even if it means he will embrace the minority myth, (the very thing he claimed to speak up against). In fact, it's clear that he decided to embody it with his entire being. 

He also decided to dismiss any and all fears that AAs have for their safety, to further his minority myth agenda. He doesn't care about how your business or family are suffering as a result of this racism. You're a victim of violent hate crime? Well, where was your American flag, you FOB? 

It's a terribly dangerous agenda. 

And it clearly shows that guy is not a competent leader by any means. 

Fuck this guy. And his Universal Backstabber Initiative."
8,fuwqqs,"I get where Yang is coming from but he's way fucking off base. This is victim blaming, pure and simple. Call out the racists. I shouldn't feel pressured to be a hero and change the minds of racists during this when I'm just trying to survive"
9,fuwqqs,"Yang's op-ed wasn't worded the best, but I feel like what he was saying is good, overall. He's telling people to be involved, donate gear, donate money, volunteer, and do their part to fight coronavirus and the economic recession. Why not? He's civic-minded, humanitarian, and people-focused. That's the bottom line I got from that op-ed - **help others in time of need.** That's the same mindset I have, too. His core message in the op-ed is totally consistent with what he's said during his presidential run, and his founding of his nonprofits, VFA and MHF. He wants to help people in need. 

I think the Japanese American community, or a few loud voices there, read something into his op-ed that struck a nerve. But their experiences doesn't necessarily match his. 

Asian Americans and others are getting up in arms about this over nothing. I know Yang is an easy scapegoat, from Asian Americans as well as others. But you guys should open up your eyes and see how much he's done and maybe try to support him. He's the first AsAm candidate to get this far. He actually busts a lot of stereotypes. He's overall, very cool, creative, visionary, free-wheeling, and fun. Those go directly against the Asian stereotypes of robotic, uncreative, boring, and cold."

> Two security guards who, in a second video, appear to instruct the victim to leave the area after he was robbed, were placed on administrative leave by Critical Intervention Patrol.

0,ez9d7a,The frequency of these mixups is worryingly comical
1,ez9d7a,"I mean clearly, if you ever seen a Filipino or a Korean before, you would probably have a low chance of mixing them up... both ethic groups have distinctions that you can identify and easily see who is Korean or Filipino. 

Did the person who messed this up live under a rock?"
2,ez9d7a,It's just better to ignore them at this point... they don't care about us calling out on them lol.. they did it to kpop groups and Andrew Yang recently too. They try to look for anyone that looks similar and post them instead.
3,ez9d7a,"These two look nothing alike, although some Filipinos look East Asian (i.e. Manny Jacinto). I am Chinese and have a few cousins who frequently get mistaken for Filipino because they have darker skin and wide eyes."
4,ez9d7a,It's easier to confuse Natalie Portman and Keira Knightly than these two
5,ez9d7a,"At the risk of downvotes, I actually do think [they look similar](https://822827.smushcdn.com/1615104/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Crazy-Rich-Asiatic-star-Nico-Santos-calls-on-American-media-1536x1152.jpg?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1), just with different skintones. Very similar lips, noses, eyebrows, glasses, and faceshapes. 

This seems more like mixing up Nina Doborev (Bulgarian) and Victoria Justice (half Puerto Rican), which [happens all the time](http://www.mtv.com/news/2552877/nina-dobrev-victoria-justice/) because [they look similar](https://in.bookmyshow.com/entertainment/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Nina-Victoria-Justice.jpg) despite their different ethnicities. Sarah Hyland & Mila Kunis and Zoey Deschanel & Katy Perry get mixed up all the time as well, and I think they look less similar than Santos and Jin-won do.

Edit: There are lots of racist mix-ups out there, but imo it dilutes the conversation when we lump in honest mix-ups due to very similar looks and not just race."

0,sqlldt,"I posted on Facebook about my trip to China and how I learned so much about my family, my culture, my heritage. And then this lanky nerdy white band kid from high school comments, ""what about the ughyurs"". So many layers to unpack. 

Your feeling is valid. You gotta be lowkey these days. I used to have diverse friends but as I'm getting older, I feel like it's optimal for me to make only Asian American friends. Chinese American friends. The word china is so polluted now, but it's not for us, because we still eat the niangao our mom made, the chinese new year special on cctv with the comedy skits and stuff, the old opera songs our parents used to listen to, running around as little kids during the holidays at a family friends house, crying to our parents when kids bully you at school and they comfort you in Chinese. It's not as toxic a word to us. It's not toxic at all, it's just the word to describe us. So when we are together, it's understood amongst us that Chinese isn't bad it's just who we are. The subtext is understood. You don't have to explain why you love who you are. That's my reasoning. I used to have diverse friends but for strengthening my sense of identity and choosing to fight fewer battles, I've tried to entrench myself in the bubble. Even other Asian kids, Viet kids who's parents fought communists, Korean kids who's parents fought communists, Taiwanese kids who's parents fought communists, it's a similar culture but you won't get the same comfort saying ""I'm trying to understand what it means to be Chinese american"" with them than other ABCs.

All in all, I think your feelings are super valid, but it's just up to you to find an environment where you can discover those feelings, grow. Maybe even find a therapist. Journal a bit. It's hard times for us and it requires more thought."
1,sqlldt,"Stop caring about what white Redditors think. Looking for validation from racists is ridiculous. I feel like some people put too much weight on a person’s opinion just for being white. For me, it’s other Asian Americans opinions that have the most weight and matter more."
2,sqlldt,"Yes I do. Just remember Reddit is an echo chamber for any sort of political or racial stance so all the racists will be here, usually uneducated or unemployed bigots with took much energy and time in their hands because their life isn’t as satisfying or busy. So take Reddit, tiktok and all the other toxic social medias as a pinch of salt, they don’t represent the whole worlds views and opinion. That being said I do feel like there’s so much racism right now that i think it’s best to take social media detox."
3,sqlldt,Plot twist: A lot of people who claim to just hate the government but not the people actually also hates the people.
4,sqlldt,"If I was younger I would have felt bad, but now that I'm older and have experienced my share of racism and violence, no; if anything it just hardens my resolve.

I am proud to be Chinese and if someone wants to come up and start something, I am more than happy to engage."
5,sqlldt,"I am so tired of people saying they hate the CCP and not the Chinese when it's painstakingly obvious they're just saying it to mask their racism. They say something completely racist and then they slap on the ""haha I just hate the evil CCP"" and now somehow it's a critique of government?

We all know deep down that they're not really critisizing the CCP. They just want an excuse to be racist."
6,sqlldt,"It’s fear and jealousy, plain and simple (and racism, of course). Americans have been forced fed this idea of China as “the enemy”, every single news story about China is about how its “failing” in some way or is “evil”. I signed up for this newsletter from the NYT about China, and the description was just “News about China”. I thought I would learn about solar power plants, or even stuff like the economy, new technologies, language quirks, culture, anything, really. And the first edition I received was all about these city workers who (trigger warning: animal abuse) >!beat a puppy to death!<. The Western media doesn’t even try to hide their bias against China anymore and I have no question in my mind that it’s fueling attacks on Asian Americans in the US. 

I wish I had some suggestions for you for media to read (in English) that isn’t either making China out to be this big bad terror or never admitting the Chinese government has done anything wrong ever. I’d love to find one but it sucks because everyone has an agenda. 

China Smack (now defunct, I believe) used to have fluff news and just fun stories and there are other websites like that, but there can be little substance there sometimes."
7,sqlldt,"The anti China disinformation campaign by the US and by the west is just beginning. 30 years ago, China was some back water third world country that the US wanted to take advantage of with cheap labor. Now it’s an economic and military powerhouse that’s poised to overtake the US as the dominant superpower. US hegemony is shrinking and this frightens many people in the US. 

All the disinformation and anti China rhetoric is an attempt to prime the population for war. We did this in the 1930s and 1940s as well with the Germans and Japanese. You need paint your enemy in a negative light to make them less human. And the media is throwing random things at the wall and hoping something will stick, like xinjiang and the tennis player and the Olympics. 

Instead of feeling depressed, you should feel proud. Think of how far China and the Chinese people have come in the last thirty years. 30 years ago, China was still using steam engines, now there’s bullet trains everywhere. 30 years ago, there were rice paddy fields and now every city is a bustling metropolis that’s bigger and more populated than nyc. 30 years ago, US banned China from accessing the ISS and now China created their own shiny new space station and banned the US. 

And the most important thing, if you’re getting depressed, get off Reddit. Reddit has nowadays become a cesspool of anti China propaganda. Reddit is full of sweaty neckbeards in fly over states. In the real world, you’ll find that majority of people aren’t anti China."
8,sqlldt,"I feel the same way you do. I like following the live threads of the Olympics and every time China wins something, they’re accused of cheating. At least 3 threads had to be locked because of racism. During the short track speed skating race, 2 Koreans and 1 Hungarians were penalized and disqualified and China ended up getting gold. So many racist comments ensued, saying China has a culture of cheating. One Korean commenter even compared Chinese to cockroaches. 

It’s funny that Westerners think Chinese are brainwashed but Westerners’ responses to anything good happening to China shows that they have been thoroughly indoctrinated without their knowledge."
9,sqlldt,I get more frustrated than depressed. Frustrated because anti-Asian racism is amped up by this. Frustrated because there is likely some truths (what government is perfect?) Frustrated by the blatant propaganda and narrative that nobody dares challenge. Frustrated by the general lack of evidence based analysis.
10,sqlldt,[deleted]
11,sqlldt,"I'm not going to tell you ""don't mind them"" OP, but I do want to offer some insight.

These anti-Chinese sentiment aren't just some recent development, this is from **decades (century+)** of propaganda towards Chinese people ever since the gold rush.  From the Page Act of 1875([""end the danger of cheap Chinese labor and immoral Chinese women""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_Act_of_1875?wprov=sfla1)) to the construction of [Angel Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Island_Immigration_Station?wprov=sfla1), directed and propagated efforts *from the government* sowed the seeds for the Chinese hate you see today.  All of these didn't go away until [1943](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnuson_Act?wprov=sfla1), when the US needed to appear as a beacon of justice in WWII.  Even then, these legislation didn't really go away until the onset of the Civil Rights Movement.  Just like the New Jim Crow, Chinese Americans are still being discriminated against with the image of ""model minority"".  All of this is to say, racism towards Chinese came on well before CCP is what you see today.

Obviously, I don't have a solution for you OP; at times, I feel the same shame and reservation that you mentioned.  But I try to keep in mind that the hatred isn't towards me, and are spread by people that might even be oblivious to the propaganda they are subject to.  It doesn't excuse it by any means, but it does help with my internalization of that hate.

I, too, have a dream that my children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.  The silver lining is that you and I can be a part of what will bring about that dream."

14,sqlldt,Congress just allocated millions of dollars for negative news coverage of China so it’s just gonna get worse :(((
15,sqlldt,"To me it's just painfully obvious the US has structural issues.  Who spends $200MM a year just to fund anti-China propaganda in both English and Chinese.  The US is still suffering from nearly 1MM covid deaths and it finds money to write anti-China propaganda based on very little credible evidence; which in turn screws up Asian American daily life.

Just look at these racist they pick some random Province/territory on China's periphery and tries to create a sedition movement.  Same pattern for Taiwan, HK, Tibet, and Xingjiang.  With very little success.

Everywhere Asians succeed in the US you start seeing the glass ceiling being put up.  Academics, Business leadership, and now random opinion pieces that Asians are over represented in Figure skating.

I don't get depressed over these things.  It just illustrates to me all these White people issues.  They can't compete with Asians at home or abroad and they get salty over it.

The same with self hating Asians looking for White saviors.  They are in literal meltdown mode because their world is getting flipped upside down in the last 2 years.  Whites are a liability now.

China has a better covid-19 prevention policy, Asian Americans are still very successful as a groups even though the rest of American is going down."
16,sqlldt,"When the first actual skirmish between China and the US happens, we are screwed and I mean the Asian community in general not just Chinese Americans. Just look at what happened to anyone who looked vaguely Arab in the aftermath of 9/11, I remembers Sikhs we're getting jumped in the streets because apparently they look vaguely like brown Muslims.

Russians have the advantage of being white, we will always be the other no matter how much we assimilate."
17,sqlldt,"Why should YOU be ashamed of being Chinese? YOU didn't do anything. I'm against all racism, and anyone who is racist is a jackass.

That being said, people hating on the CCP shouldn't affect you. I'm not going to go over all the valid points to hate them, but at the end of the day a Nation's government (especially an unelected one...) should have no bearing on your pride in your heritage. 

Focus on the things that are worth being proud of: language, history, culture, and arts. Explore it! Connect with it! I know it made me disconnect my identity with the CCP. If anything those things made me hate the CCP more."
18,sqlldt,"The only reason the west is giving China so much shit is because they are afraid and insecure of a strong China.

19,sqlldt,Sadly I got pretty used to it. Just remember that Reddit doesn’t represent the entire world.
20,sqlldt,I’m frustrated by this too and I feel like china’s wolf warrior diplomacy just makes everything so much worse
21,sqlldt,"As a Caucasian American I am sorry about the treatment you have received. To be honest I don't know all of the history or information of Chinese culture. None the less, from my experience I respect the devotion to certain precepts or values that are there as well as how you all present yourselves. In all honesty I just want everyone to make amends and help each other towards a better future for us all, but I do not know exactly how to go about that."
22,sqlldt,"Most of the comments I’ve seen online hating on China are mostly anti-CCP comments, and as a Chinese person I agree, that government is pretty evil. I believe that the US government is anti-CCP rather than anti-Chinese, Canada kinda has the same thing going on. 

However, there are stupid people that can’t seem to realize the difference between China’s government and Chinese people, there’s no excuse for that, plain stupidity. Sometimes even Chinese people themselves don’t know the difference, some may even associate loving China with loving the CCP (without even knowing it). 

Chinese culture and the Chinese government are two completely different things, and one might even argue that this current Chinese government ruined a lot of Chinese culture. 

Just remember that whatever people are saying, it’s not YOU, and it’s not the chinese people, it’s not even China."
23,sqlldt,"I think it's important that you learn not to put everything under the umbrella of Chinese as racist people would do.

1. The people
2. The CCP
3. The culture
4. Chinese diaspora

These things are all different, like you've mentioned you don't like the government and the issues they have. Neither does the rest of the world, but have pride in your culture and history.

In Indonesia we have a lot of things that China brought us, from some foods to events and even people (my family is Chinese-Indonesian). So while I personally don't feel Chinese at all, I know that if I follow history a lot of beautiful things came from there.

p.s. it's not just Indonesia a lot of (South) East Asian) culture got influenced by Chinese culture.

tldr;  
Yes the CCP is hated by everyone and for a good reason.   
No, you shouldn't be ashamed of being Chinese as your culture is very rich."
24,sqlldt,"People do indeed base their perceptions of Chinese people off of the atrocities the CCP has committed in their time, and that's awful. You shouldn't be disappointed for someone rightfully criticizing the country's awful and inhuman governance, but if they talk down on your people/your culture, you have every right to fret over it, and even educate them about how they're wrong.

I've heard a lot of awful stereotypes about my country as well, and it made me ashamed to tell people I hail from the said nation, so I understand where you're coming from."
25,sqlldt,"Meh, no not really. The CCP does not represent all Han Chinese nor Chinese culture itself. So some dolts wanna hate on the CCP, then so be it.

The line gets crossed when people wanna hate on aspects on Chinese culture itself and extrapolate it to apply to me or you. You know, the smelly ethnic food or the dog-eating. *That* is racism. There are also more tired and annoying stereotypes endlessly repeated, but I won't get into them here because people get the point. 

Long story short, who gives a shit what other people think. At the end of the day, you are your own person. Don't let other apply whatever negative stereotypes to you. Don't let other people make *you* to be some authentic spokesperson for a government thousands of miles away, on the other side of the world. If China does something people hate, oh well. What can you do about it? You're an *American*. And one among many at that, as well. 

If you wanna be proud about being Chinese while keeping in mind other people's opinions, don't let people or yourself conflate the CCP with China and Chinese culture. Or you could be one of many people who are proud of being Chinese, come what may."
26,sqlldt,"China is bad because:

\- Crushing inequality

\- Brutally authoritarian government

\- A level of racism that is even the worst parts of America would have trouble accepting

These are real issues that any journalist should be able to capture.  Unfortunately, China watchers seem more interested in shit like social credit system and wumaos.  The level of analysis of Chinese society seems shallow by design (beliefs like the Cultural Revolution destroyed basic courtesy or Chinese culture is so obviously wrong and yet it keeps getting repeated) and quite frankly, when people say they hate the government but not the people, its a little hard to believe that because a lot of analysis of even the CCP seems to depend on stereotypes."
27,sqlldt,"I think this question would extend to any Western Asian person. From my experience, the Asian diaspora typically has a Pan-Asian Identity. This is clearly seen during the COVID19 pandemic, when Asians of all ethnicities were getting antagonized, even though COVID19 is said to have originated in China."
28,sqlldt,"No I am extremely proud, China has actually accomplished a lot and my relatives were the ones that helped mold the country into what it is."
29,sqlldt,"Bruh you gotta seperate your race from the criticism. Like we're American right? But America fucking sucks. And we gotta make it better. You're Chinese and you can be proud of a lot of that but let's be honest, from a world stage China acts like the villain. Lots of countries do. When you have the amount of people and the money as China though, more eyes are on you because China could legitimately save the world if they wanted to."
30,sqlldt,"You are an American. Some xenophobic people can't (or, don't want to) tell the  difference between China and (Chinese) Americans. That's their problem.

You, as an ordinary American, can not be blamed for what another country does."
31,sqlldt,As an uyghur guy I think you should have pride in your ethnicity and culture. Always separate your ethnicity with whatever government there is. I hate the ccp but I always separate the culture and people
32,sqlldt,"No.

I understand criticisms to be of the Chinese government, not the culture or its people."
33,sqlldt,"Not that bothered tbh. I see myself as chinese american, not chinese. It's a huge difference.

I honestly felt like i had more in common with people when i visited turkey than china, so i dont feel insulted when china gets attacked on reddit. 

It would suck for some racist to conflate me with someone with china, but idk im just not too worried about that rn. I imagine it might become more of an issue as tensions ramp up over the coming years and decades though"
34,sqlldt,"I’m not Chinese. I spent 9 months in China for foreign exchange when I was 18, (22 now.)  I’m American born and Caucasian. What depresses me are the CCP and the United States government and the influence on the media that they both wield. I just want us all to be brothers and sisters on this earth but we’re constantly being split apart by these inane forces that strive for nothing but greed. It’s you and me my friend. Don’t give up on unity; give up on those that divide us."

In Connecticut, [owners of a Chinese a restaurant were getting racial slurs and death threats on the phone](https://www.ctpost.com/news/coronavirus/article/Seymour-rallies-behind-Asian-American-restaurant-15192182.php), but also getting a lot of orders after people heard about this incident. However, some other places may not be so lucky as they are struggling with funds like that article about [Washington restaurants](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/smashed-windows-racist-graffiti-vandals-target-asian-americans-amid-coronavirus-n1180556) getting vandalized with broken windows, but damages are at least $1000 or more to fix when sales are already low.

But yeah, no where is exactly 100% safe. Even though I live in SoCal, I still keep my guard up when I go outside. On a related note, I heard 7 Leaves is pretty good, but never had it. Don't have them here where I live unless I visit OC for the nearest location."
2,g6btjh,Thanks for posting this--goes to show even being in an area as Asian-dominated and supposedly liberal as SJ doesn't protect Asian-American entities from hurt. 7 Leaves is delicious and I also hope these incidences--and this pandemic in general--gets younger Asian-Americans to recognize that being Asian in America can still be perilous.

I've gotten that ganging up on me, too, from a black customer and a white and black employee at a Starbucks. All three of them ganged up on me and shouted, with disgusted looks in their faces. It was terrifying. They have so much disgust towards Asians, and they feel free to bully and hurt Asians, too. I can totally stand my ground, but it doesn't matter - their stereotypes of a scared, passive, non-threatening Asian is driven in too deeply."

Cantonese used to be the most common Chinese dialect in America up until the 2000s, but nowadays most immigrants are from mainland Mandarin speaking provinces.

2,balm32,"This isn't true.  They've always been in history, at least when I was growing up.  

Honestly, they've been highlighted more often, as with the Japanese.  There's nothing wrong with that. Even through today, which includes Koreans, East Asians have had a stronger voice in being recognized. 

Someone please put Filipinos, especially since they immigrated to America that predates the Chinese coming to America, into history books. 

I thought it was really cute that the article put Cesar Chavez as a person who fought for worker's dignity.

0,b2neqy,"This article takes a very surface level view of the statistics and misleads the reader about their conclusions.

-Asian Americans are NOT the highest earning or wealthiest ethnic group. This ""fact"" is a misrepresentation of statistics, ignoring two enormous confounds: Asian Americans have more breadwinners per households, and Asian Americans are largely concentrated on the coasts in high cost of living areas. When controlling for those factors, Asian Americans earn 22% less than whites with similar degrees and have 32% less median wealth. [Source](https://prosperitynow.org/blog/racial-wealth-snapshot-asian-americans).

-The article makes the point that Asian Americans are ""the most economically divided racial group in the country"". This would suggest that one should NOT attempt to segment by racial group. As within group variance increases, the the predictive power of the group identifier decreases. If the goal is to help the economically disadvantaged, then income should be the basis of affirmative action rather than race. Otherwise you doubly disadvantage poor Asians, such as the [90% of students at Stuyvesant that qualify for free lunches.](https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/stuyvesant-serves-needy-minorities-article-1.3944199)"
1,b2neqy,"I like the article, but my goodness it is hypocritical, it complains about generalizing but then generalizes Chinese and Japanese when there's a bunch of low income Chinese and Japanese who suffer from the same struggles. It's not just the hmongs and SEAs, the article just perpetuates more inaccuracies. I am a second generation Chinese that come from a free/reduce lunch family, I'm the only Asian in my town, I struggled with racism and hate from all groups not just from whites, and at the same time I have no support because Asian population is zilch here, at least other minorities do, yet I'm still able to perform better than over 95% of my classmates only to face more struggles by people who are apparently ""understanding"". And I'm not the only Chinese or Japanese to go through that either thats for sure"
2,b2neqy,"The real question is how pro-AA (and anti-reform) people can simultaneously argue that access to higher ed is absolutely critical to the success of marginalized people and then respond to Asian immigrants' anxiety about getting into the best schools with ""it's all fake you dumb sheeple there's NO DIFFERENCE between Harvard and state schools"". If there was really no difference there wouldn't be so many economic and social barriers keeping rich white kids in and everyone else out. "
3,b2neqy,"Not that race-based affirmative action isn't kinda bunk, but how come the discussion around it in the AAPI community is always ""fuck mediocre black and brown kids"" instead of ""fuck mediocre white kids""? I feel like the question should be more around why white spots aren't the first to get cut in these scenarios."
4,b2neqy,"Growing up in Texas, I never realized that asian-americans were considered one of the wealthiest groups in the country. My family is pretty well off, but we've been in the US since the 1860s. Most other asian-americans who live in the rural parts of Texas are the children/grand-children of refugees.

There's a ridiculous economic divide between asian-americans in the country. Most of these lower-income Vietnamese families in Texas have to struggle way more to get into college than a poor black or hispanic family. That whole affirmative action case at Harvard brought attention to how asian-americans are getting treated unfairly in admissions, but Harvard is literally like the top 0.01%. 

These asian-americans in low-income areas can't even get into STATE schools because of diversity quotas. Texas is really bad when it comes to affirmative action, especially UT Austin. That school basically forces a diversity quota, and asians get fucked. Poor white families get fucked even harder in Texas since there's a lot more of them. 

Look up the case: Fisher vs. University of Texas. I read somewhere before that UT Austin's hispanic enrollment used to be 24%, but only scored ~200 lower on the SATs (on a scale of 1600) than the average white or asian student. That's the reason why a lot more asians and whites in Texas started to mark themselves as part hispanic on admissions, and some are even changing their last names. At the same time, it also fucks over ACTUAL hispanic students, because more whites/asians are labeling themselves as hispanic and filling in their hispanic quota. 

Race-based affirmative action is a joke, and I'll never understand why anyone is okay with it. It fucks over people of every race and ethnicity, as opposed to just making admissions based on real qualifications.
"
5,b2neqy,"Yo I think it's really interesting how even though East Asians have a lot higher income than whites they have a lot less wealth.


My dad makes what would be considered upper middle class salary in LA but my mom still has to work like a dog. White kids at my school whose parents make the same amount (or even less) than mine do live in fucking beach homes and suburbs and shit while we live in a shitty condo. "
6,b2neqy,"SEAsian whose family arrived as a refugees. Not immigrants; refugees. My father spent time in refugee camps. My mother was a refugee in another country, and it tooks years for her to obtain citizenship in that country. My parents earlier lives sucked, because they grew up in war time. They had to start afresh; with nothing. 

The lack of Asian American representation in the press, or the misrepresentation of us really thwarts us.

Everything about race-based affirmative action is wrong. Categorically wrong. Don't bother defending it, justifying it; it is racist. Apply affirmative action based on socio-economic factors, not on race.

I grew up as a minority in a predominantly hispanic part of town. My high school has 17 asians with a population of 1333 students. My school friends, my coworkers are predominantly hispanic. Many I knew had middle class upbringings; a higher standard than my own, my ethnic peers, and so on. That is life in Los Angeles. There's nothing in their experience in which I would consider themselves as a minority besides maybe cultural media representation, nationally, but that is quickly changing."
7,b2neqy,">In Lee’s eyes, it is Students for Fair Admissions, not Harvard, that doesn’t recognize socioeconomic diversity among Asians. “It’s very specific groups filing this lawsuit, and yet we’re all being clumped together,” she said. She is skeptical that eliminating race from college admissions decisions will benefit Hmong students, young people who, like her, grew up poor and in households where no English was spoken. “It will definitely hurt them,” she predicted.

I've always wondered about this. Elite universities have always used this line to defend their usage of affirmative action - that poorer, less-visible subsets of the Asian American community can benefit from considerations of race and ethnicity. At the same time, this exact same point is used by opponents of affirmative action - that lumping all Asian subgroups together *prevents* us from being able to distinguish the socioeconomic disparities within the broader Asian American community and thus doubly harms disadvantaged groups like Hmong Americans.

My guess is that the reality is somewhere in between, but do we have any credible research to back one side or another?"

he challenged me on it!!! and i said look up the word jap right tf now and whaddya know? i literally hit all the same points as the introduction on wikipedia

i really think the history of racial slurs should be a part of our primary education, at the very least middle school history classes. it's one thing for kids to pick up these words and potentially never seek out or come in contact with the true meaning of what they're saying. it's another thing to teach kids exactly what they're saying to each other, and give them the opportunity to consciously choose to maintain respect in their vocabulary"

5,rkt32f,"Reminds me of a discussion I read by some older people.  Sports fans.  They were lamenting the large number of Asian graduate students in STEM programs with a very thin veneer of ""because they don't go to sporting events"" as they excuse.

One of them actually wrote (*wrote*, so he had time to think this over before letting the world see it), ""We need more rednecks here and fewer (redacted).""  

I'm redacting the term used because it hit the amazing balance between being horribly offensive *and* something I'd never heard before, but you can probably piece it together via parallelism in the sentence structure.  It was amazing, really.

Of course, this is the same person who, in other discussions, has been whining that he's going to stop donating to the university because students are required to wear masks now.

I understand where he's coming from.  Not that his beliefs are justified *at all*, but I understand that he holds those beliefs because of the firehose of propaganda that has been soaking white Americans in recent years and robbing many of them of the ability to think critically about, well, anything.

I have a sister who married a white guy, and apparently he's a perfect angel who really does try to be good (and succeeds most of the time!) but whose family is *difficult to be around* at times.  Not all of them, but a few of them stand out.  Like, one of them initially got mad at my brother-in-law for ""marrying a Chinese spy.""  They consistently go on and on about whatever Fox News's latest manufactured outrage topic is.

It's my understanding that my brother-in-law doesn't talk to those relatives much anymore.

1,mv33wb,"Two years ago, there was another racist assault against another elderly Chinese man in San Francisco. [The DA claimed the victim did not want to press charges, and instead wished for the perpetrator to go through ""restorative justice"" instead.](https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/SF-Bayview-attack-Second-suspect-surrenders-to-15098296.php) This seemed a bit unusual to me; I don't think I've ever heard ""restorative justice"" said in Cantonese. It seemed to me as if Boudin had taken advantage of the victim's lack of English to press his own agenda, and now there's strong signs pointing to Boudin doing the same in this case as well.

> According to Jack Liao, the DA’s office told the family his grandfather did not want to press charges. The family says Rong Xin Liao would have never said that.
> 
> “When I talked  to my grandfather two days ago he said he definitely wanted the attacker to be punished,” Jack Liao said, also pointing to an interview his grandfather did with ABC, where the grandfather says, “I want a very strict punishment…but I don’t want him to be executed.”
> 
> Jack Liao says he and his father were only contacted twice by the DA’s office in 2020, right after the attack happened, and were put under the impression that the trial would be postponed until 2021. Jack Liao said he did not hear from the DA’s office again until the family’s trip to the courtroom on April 14, 2021. Unbeknownst to them, the DA’s office had been in touch with his grandfather multiple times throughout 2020 and the case proceeded, including moving Ramos-Hernandez out of the normal court process and into the mental health program in fall 2020.

2,ciopv7,"Yes, it is racist. And Asians have to go through this regularly and it is annoying AF. Add the fact that your background is Korean and then the more annoying follow up questions of: North Korea and South Korea. I just want to say, go fuck yourself, to people who ask me this. It's tiresome."
3,ciopv7,It was absolutely racist lmfao. Next time ask if they’re Native American.
4,ciopv7,she was definitely being racist. I'm peeved for you too.

god i wish i had a dollar every time a white person asked me that. next time, don't explain. feign ignorance and and smile as their questions get progressively more racist :D"
7,ciopv7,"Nah you're not overreacting, I would feel the same way. It's honestly baffling the amount of times I've been asked similar things."
8,ciopv7,"So, I took a class about exactly this last year in college. I should probably preface this by saying I’m in the exact same boat as you - Chinese-American who was adopted at 9 months old by two white folk. Basically, this kind of thing is called a microaggression and *yes*, it is in fact, racist. 

Here’s the formal definition (and what Google has to say on the matter): “Microaggression is a term used for brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioural, or environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative prejudicial slights and insults toward any group, particularly culturally marginalized groups.”

Basically, microaggressions are what white people would respond to with “oh, you’re overreacting!” (i.e. where are you *from*??? 🙄🙄)"
9,ciopv7,"This same thing has happened to me numerous times in my lifetime.  I'm Nisei born and raised in Hawaii, served 4 years in the US military service, worked in the Pentagon and held a top secret/crypto security clearance.

10,ciopv7,You weren't wrong at all. Trust your spidey sense. Good job.
11,ciopv7,I’m also Korean and adopted by a white family and yeah I often would get that same question from people esp when I was a teenager and lived in SC from old white grizzled men. It’s definitely racist AF to say “yeah but where are you REALLY from?” She knew there was a better way to say it but simply chose not to do it because she’s a moron.
12,ciopv7,"I occasionally get this and my great grandparents were born here, family's been here since the late-1800s, and I get this from White folks whose families arrived here post-WWII. Yes; it's racist and feel free to tell them to fuck off, that you're just as American as they are. There is no, ""How American Test""."
13,ciopv7,She was an ignorant bitch.  Good for you for putting her racist ass in her place.  Shit like this pisses me off as you can prob tell.
14,ciopv7,"I like that idea. I am going to start sporting more USA gear. And yes, that was racist. She is othering you. It is an alienation tactic drilled into the collective unconscious of many whites in the USA. It helps support white supremacy in the USA whether they know it or not because it implies that you have to be white to be from here."
15,ciopv7,"What the actual fuck? As if when the brits came to America they brought the flag with them. No, they brought slaves, made internment camps for the Japanese, and invaded a whole ass continent with other civilized people on there, and with that the fucking flag. So it's a part of the fucking history. Ma'm why aren't you going around with a brit flag drinking tea with crumpets in your purse? 

I wanna know how she responded to the adoption. Like, YES, YOUR ""OWN KIND"" brought me here and wanted me. 🙄"
16,ciopv7,Yepppp. People sometimes go as far as asking my husband where he was stationed. As in suggesting he served in xyz Asian country and brought me back with him. Bc ya know me being an American citizen on my own is absolutely ludicrous

I am Taiwanese American, I wear/have worn lularoe, veteran owned apparel, ran & did events with ex military.
I have to deal with this at some level, & it honestly seems worse as I have gotten older.  
They have no idea of my age, ethnicity or background.  
It's incredibly disheartening."
18,ciopv7,I love giving them a smart ass response. I'm from Seattle. Then they ask where my parents are from and I say California and Oregon. Then they ask where my grandparents are from then I say California and Oregon. Gets them every time. Keep it up. White people can't handle the fact that some of us Asian Americans are more American than they are.
19,ciopv7,It was more than mildly racist
20,ciopv7,There's no mildly casually about it. It was racist.
21,ciopv7,"I love the fact that she ""Trying to change your heritage or what?"" like why do you care so much about my heritage?? What does the American flag have to do with heritage? I don't think she knows what that word means. Next time just throw a dictionary at her."

30,ciopv7,i'm not adopted but i think it's how you interpret it.  i genuinely don't get offended when people ask unless they are making a distinction to be rude.  i take it as just them not knowing what to ask/how to start a conversation with someone perhaps not in their bubble and just trying to get information to think of more things to talk about.

35,ciopv7,"I had a similar beginning as you - Korean adopted into the Midwest. This type of interaction occurs to me a handful of times a year. It's quite annoying and personally I've been dealing with it since I can remember.

Yes, my area is predominately white and so it's no surprise that these interactions are 99.99% of the time coming from a white 50+ year old. I don't even know what they are trying to do or get out of it. Like, why does pointing out my race get their dicks hard?

It's rarely enough saying that you're from here (wherever your state is). You can bet on getting the following ups.

My friends and I have an annual float trip in bumfuck nowhere Missouri and I got a feeling some of the gas stations we stop at only see one Asian a year. Surprise, It's me!

It can be comments, lack of attention or service, or even just the staring. This shit won't ever end."
36,ciopv7,Woof
37,ciopv7,"Sorry this happened to you.  May I ask where the incident occurred?  Bc you know, there are some places in this country where people have never seen a cultural ""other.""  For all we know, you could be the first Asian face this woman has ever seen.  IF that were the case, I wouldn't say she was racist, just ignorant.  Btw this happens in big cities and goes the other way too.  I live in California near a predominantly Asian community where many residents have never interacted with a black person, and they probably make all sorts of racist-sounding questions and comments.

22,bpdygi,"Serious question, do people actually consider Keanu Reeves an Asian guy in terms of representation? Because if that’s the case, you must think think Aaron Sorkin was wrong about there not being an Asian male movie star because we have Keanu Reeves. Presumably every Keanu Reeves movie counts as Asian male representation right?

Btw I actually like Keanu, but I’m not convinced his movies count as examples of Asian male representation."
23,bpdygi,Yes!!! Love some good Asian rep in romcoms!!
24,bpdygi,I don’t usually laugh at trailers much but I laughed 3 times at this one. :)
25,bpdygi,Randall Park 🥰
26,bpdygi,[removed]
27,bpdygi,[removed]
28,bpdygi,I fricken love these two
29,bpdygi,"This looks great. Love Randy and Ali.

It’s crazy, but has there even been any big rom coms with two Asian American leads??? I’m trying to think of any and I can’t... And it’s 2019! WTF, Hollywood.
I hope this movie makes a billion dollars."
30,bpdygi,"As a man I can't help but feel this was written by a man, it's got male fantasy written all over it."
0,am7430,"This reminds me of how there was a Mexican-American studies class offered in Tucson, Arizona public schools that helped increase student engagement and improved their grades. Unfortunately, that course was later banned by conservatives who thought that it radicalized students and indoctrinated them into being ""anti-white"" (later ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge)."
1,am7430,"It’s so cool to see young people embrace their culture and even fight to hear more about it. I know that when I was younger, that wasn’t important to me, so I’m proud of and really respect these students. "
2,am7430,"This is awesome. I used to read about Asian American history for fun during my rare free time in HS, and could only dream of a day where it may be acknowledged and taught like any other part of history, even in my school that was 60% Asian. Good to see these kids are taking the first step. "
3,am7430,"Interesting. I’m more in support of having classes that teach the history of people indigenous to the lands you live in. I had Hawaiian Studies (mandatory, I believe in Hawaii) with an amazing teacher and I definitely learned a lot. As someone Asian, I definitely support Asian American studies being learned especially in a district with such a large population. I hope it focuses on the wider community than just East Asia, though."
4,am7430,Awesome to hear. There is never any reason not to gain more knowledge of the world and learning about our Identities offers powerful self-understanding and understanding of others.
5,am7430,"I don’t know about this, really. High school really needs to teach basic stuff, and only a very large high school can really afford to offer such niche electives. I think the bigger fight is that “World History” needs to stop being so focused on the history of western civilization. And European History needs to be de-prioritized. And American History has to be less about white American hero worship. Etc."

0,9xo4aa,Well he is still young and he is half British.
1,9xo4aa,He really does remind me of Old Hollywood
2,9xo4aa,"I’d rather see him in an original spy action movie with a majority Asian cast with Asian culture related themes and motifs instead of plopping him as the only Asian character in a reboot of James Bond. 

But maybe that’s too idealistic."
3,9xo4aa,"That would be neat if it ever happened.

Also, if you're looking for a ""spy"" (sort-of, but not really) film with an Asian lead: I liked The Foreigner starring Jackie Chan."
4,9xo4aa,"Sorry. I don't think this will happen. It's one thing for the success of Henry Golding and I'm glad for that, but there's just no way that he'll be the next bond. Bond will first consider  a black person like Idris Alba before an  Asian person. 

Never say never though, but I'll be pessimistic on this subject just because of history. "
5,9xo4aa,Forget that. Make a new spy movie without the old format. 
6,9xo4aa,They'll probably pick someone blah like Henry Cavill.
7,9xo4aa,It should've been Idris Elba.
8,9xo4aa,The author of the James Bond series refused Idris Elba as a potential bond because he was “too street” for the role. I seriously doubt an Asian person would be considered before a white passing minority person or a white woman. Doctor who was a white dude through 12 actors before picking a white woman and he’s supposed to be an body regenerating alien. 
9,9xo4aa,Who are these people? Idris Elba for the next Bond!
10,9xo4aa,"Why do people think all asian or black casts is so much better than having an asian lead a movie even with more white people. If he gets a James Bond movie than that can be good cause it can show he earned the role or that Hollywood is becoming acceptable with AA as normal fucking Americans. This is the thing with this diversity shit, make movies that make minorities known as normal Americans. It's why a movie like Searching proves that. I mean I guess more Asian but you had that white cop girl as a character. Why are people upset if he is in a Bond film?"

0,9e7ucx,"She played incredible and deserved the win. But it’s gonna be overshadowed by the controversy. A shame that the biggest moment of her life won’t be remembered by how amazing she played, especially when it mattered most."
1,9e7ucx,"First Japanese person to win this title, right?

Hopefully no one puts any asterisks next to this record."
2,9e7ucx,"https://streamable.com/749pc

Fuck this bullshit, man. This should have been one of the greatest moments of her life, and it was torn from her. "
3,9e7ucx,Yay for the win! Have been rooting for her on the women’s side after Li Na retired. Now if only Nishikori can get over the last hurdle. He gets so close and hurt so often. 
4,9e7ucx,"Heard that Osaka wanted to represent the US, but the USTA didn't want her, so she chose to represent Japan. Harsh penalty on Serena to overshadow Osaka's big moment. Male players have said worse without getting docked a game. Hell, in the men's tournament, Nick Kyrgios was getting a pep talk from an ump during a break before winning his match!"
5,9e7ucx,Wow did not expect this. 
6,9e7ucx,Paywall article. Can someone copy and paste the text?
7,9e7ucx,"Never meet your heroes, kids. 

Congratulations to Naomi. I hope this win can still be one of the best moments of her life. "
8,9e7ucx,"My opinion: Serena behaved like a diva, a really arrogant, obnoxious diva showing that sportsmanship is anathema to her. "
9,9e7ucx,Way to go! She could be the next dominant American tennis player.
10,9e7ucx,"Naomi won gracefully. Serena was an entitled diva and was the sole reason for ruining this victory for Naomi. 

The crowd inadvertently made Naomi CRY on stage during the ceremony. Now imagine feeling sorry about winning the US fucking Open because your opponent decided to have a fit. 

"
11,9e7ucx,"I know close to nothing about the rules and gameplay of tennis so can someone comment on how bad the call was against Serena that made her lose it? From everything I've read across different sites and medias, it was pretty bad. 

And I can't tell since I have no reference but when Serena was talking to the ref, the fans were booing. Was it directed at the ref or Serena?"
12,9e7ucx,[deleted]
13,9e7ucx,Serena's coach admitted to coaching her or 'cheating' and it's a real shame that Naomi's moment was ruined
14,9e7ucx,"while the ending was bad, i was watching all tournament and expected naomi to cry if she won. when she made the quarters, she cried and buried her head in her towel like today, but people made fun of her about it (i know - wtf) and so she made her celebrations curt the next two rounds. 

her reaction (minus the visor pulldown) is sincerely what i had expected from a victory."
0,ujy25u,"You need to call her out on her bullshit and racism. If she's ignorant, that's one thing, but clearly, it's racism, not ignorance. If it were ignorance, she would have had an issue with the fondue but since hotpot and kbbq are ""Asian"" she suddenly has an issue with it and finds it gross. This isn't someone worth being friends with."
1,ujy25u,Time to drop said friend in my opinion.
2,ujy25u,"This person has a super sad life, I assure you. None of my non-Asian friends will reject my offer to invite them to my kbbq party. They will even bring their own meats and and ssam if they wanna go ham. I always have to cook them the after fried rice too (use left over meats + rice and make fried rice) because they demand it lol.

Sucks for her I guess lol."
3,ujy25u,Hotpot and kbbq are delicious
4,ujy25u,This “friend” is wack
5,ujy25u,She is racist.
6,ujy25u,Stop being friends with 10 year olds
7,ujy25u,"You definitely should not be friends with her anymore. If she thinks what you eat is beneath her, she probably feels that you are beneath her, too."
8,ujy25u,"Does ""MSG"" at Asian restaurants give her a headache, but she eats Doritos just fine? XD"
9,ujy25u,"Find other friends, keep going to KBBQ"
10,ujy25u,"I’m not saying that everyone has to like everything. But general openminded-ness to new experiences and things outside of your worldview are indicators of intelligence. 

It’s nicer to have friends who are not super judgmental for no reason other than their own ignorance. Time to find better friends? 

Plus the fondue comparison just indicates maybe she is just straight up racist."
11,ujy25u,"I disagree with people saying just to drop her.

Call her out on it.  Even if she denies it, you will have planted a seed in her mind.  Hopefully it will blossom into self-reflection.

After you call her out and see how she responds, *then* decide whether to drop her."
12,ujy25u,I stopped hanging out with people with tastebuds of a 6 year old.
13,ujy25u,"some people are racist. call her out on it and if she doesn't even try to come around, well, you don't need them in your life"
14,ujy25u,"fuck that bitch, call her out."
15,ujy25u,"Look, people can have different preferences for food or hobbies. If anything she should be called out for the bullshit double standard. Nobody is making her join you and your friends if it’s not to her liking, and she certainly shouldn’t yuck on your yum.

I’ve had a couple of black and Indian friends say the same when going out for kbbq finding it absurd you need to cook your own food at a restaurant, but won’t have a problem with Ramen or Pho. In the end I don’t go out to those places they don’t like and enjoy it with friends that do."
16,ujy25u,"That's really dumb - especially funny considering that Swiss people who popularized fondue in the west literally call hotpot ""Fondue Chinoise"" - Chinese fondue."
17,ujy25u,"Other than the obvious conclusion, she clearly doesn't cook also."
18,ujy25u,W.e. more hotpot and kbbq for me. Good riddance.
19,ujy25u,"Offer to bring her back to the hotpot/KBBQ place and if she says it's gross because it's raw, mention the time at the fondue place."
20,ujy25u,"im guessing you already know her enough if you think that shes gonna just deny everything

if you dont even think shes willing to learn (and really do you want to put in that effort)

why are you friends with her. she clearly disrespects asian cultures"
21,ujy25u,Reason why I’d rather not eat my food with white white people
22,ujy25u,"If you can't handle seeing raw meat, you don't deserve to eat meat at all.  But clearly she doesn't like anything associated with Asians."
23,ujy25u,get better friends
24,ujy25u,"Looks like you can make a good case with this raw meat example, so it’s a good idea to sit down and talk to her about how her negative reaction seems racially drived. Tell her that Asian culture is a really important part of who you are, and her being grossed out about it means that she is saying you are gross. If she tries to debate, I think that’s where you going to have to stop talking to her."
25,ujy25u,Was the presentation a little nicer at the fondue place? And 10x more expensive?
26,ujy25u,Kbbq is fucking rad
27,ujy25u,Your friend simply has bad taste.
28,ujy25u,"Most of my friends aren't Asian and they really liked hot pot and Korean BBQ. I also know Asians that don't like one or the other (I personally don't care for kbbq).

I think people legitimately not knowing that chink is a bad word is a thing. I dated a Native woman and she didn't know it was a slur until I told her."
29,ujy25u,Sounds like a garden variety racist to me. There are a lot of issues in the Black community with anti-Asian racism unfortunately.
30,ujy25u,Ignorance is an amazing thing.
31,ujy25u,"Your friend doesn't deserve hot pot, kbbq, and all the other amazing Asian foods. I'm glad they don't like it."
32,ujy25u,"Time to unfriend her IRL, and make some friends with taste buds. Fondue is ok, but it’s flavor depth pales in comparison to kbbq and hotpot, it’s not even the same level…that comparison is just offensive."
33,ujy25u,That’s not a friend
34,ujy25u,Sounds like the two of you don't mesh well. Maybe it's time to move on.
35,ujy25u,"Next time you go to a fondue place, make similar comments. When she looks at you weird for thinking that, remind her of hotpot and let it click."
36,ujy25u,does she not know how food works?
37,ujy25u,"How can you call this person your ""friend""?!?!?!?"
38,ujy25u,"Since she'll deny everything if you confront her, have you tried asking her why she feels that way xd usually it clicks for people that way 

SRS though, her making a grossed out face at the mere mention of something Asian is a major red flag. I don't put it past her to claim she doesn't like KBBQ so you'll keep taking her to restaurants, especially if you foot the bill"
39,ujy25u,Every time she mentions something Western that she thinks is awesome - look disgusted and tell her it reminds you of her face - fucking gross.
40,ujy25u,Is fondue a thing still? Thought that died with the '70s.
41,ujy25u,She's not a friend
42,ujy25u,"Yup listen to other comments, stop being friend with her"
43,ujy25u,"I'm not Asian American (Japanese Japanese) but I used to think hotpot is gross and fondue totally cool. I have never compared that to fondue though.

Be it Japanese, Korean or Chinese style, I don't find hotpot to be visually inviting because it looks like, and taste like a bunch of random stuff thrown into hot water. There are a few other factors that contributes to the way I see it, and I have never gathered the thought as to why I don't really like it though. Throwing raw meat doens't look clean also. (Yeah this is coming out of a mouth of Japanese but I'm just saying that I do get that feeling for whatever reasons.) It's not exactly common opinion in Japan but it's not too rare either.

I get that there are many reasons to believe that she's racist whether she's doing consciously or not, however I'd just say that, from my own experience, racism is not the necessary reason to cast a hate against hotpots.

I do enjoy hotpots now, but I still don't get as excited.

Edit: I read the OP’s edit again and now it’s more than reasonable to call out on this."
44,ujy25u,I'm surprised this friend of yours even bothers accepting you as her friend.
45,ujy25u,Former friend
46,ujy25u,"*she doesn't like that you can see the raw meat*

Acting.

Hotpot, Korean BBQ AND fondue are good as fuck.


Is your friend subspecies?"
47,ujy25u,Call her out on it before you drop her
48,ujy25u,That's a weird and bad opinion. I can see it if they are like strictly vegetarian or vegan but come on man.
49,ujy25u,I wouldn’t even call her out. I’d just drop her.
50,ujy25u,"Sushi has raw meat too. 

Is she Asian or white? If the former she has a huge inferior complex, if the latter she does not have an open mind which is a sign for trouble later."
51,ujy25u,"I don't believe your friend is racist since she was obviously open to trying Korean bbq and hotpot. It obviously seems like the presentation freaked her out, with the way kbbq is setup with the banchan and everything could be a bit overwhelming at first. It's just a ton of food in front of you you're not familiar with. 

When I was younger, raw sushi scared me. It doesn't mean I hated Japanese people. Props on her for being open to being open to going to a Korean restaurant with you. I'd suggest bringing her to a Korean fried chicken restaurant or a place that serves already cooked food like bibimbap first. 
  
I'm Asian and a lot of people on this sub probably have a chip on their shoulder when it comes to food, because growing up we'd get a lot of visceral reactions from classmates when it comes to our lunches. Also, when I tell some of my Asian friends all I've been listening to is kpop for the past 3 years half of them cringe too 😂"
52,ujy25u,Is she asian?
53,ujy25u,"Is she Asian? Just curious. In any case, she’s racist"
0,rpy9wn,"The actual interest in east Asian pop culture is not the uncomfortable part, but everything else you are describing is. I don't care if someone is interested in East Asian pop culture. What is uncomfortable to me is the increase in unwanted ignorant interactions I have received because of East Asian pop culture becoming trendy. Also them acting like the spokesperson for Asia and Asian culture, talking over Asians on Asian issues, viewing Asian cultures as the same, and then they themselves trying to gatekeep it. Again, the actual interest in East Asian pop culture is not problematic but those other actions are. Idk how to describe this but I will call it ""non-asian people appropriating Asian culture for you"" where they will take something from one country and label it from another country. Like I saw a makeup video tagged korean, but the video was titled ""Japanese makeup"" and woman in the video was Chinese. And then I saw a comment on a hotpot video where they called it korean BBQ. The ignorance was hilarious that time, but most of the time, it's not. Also yellowface is always problematic. But again that is a whole different thing than liking East Asian pop culture."
1,rpy9wn,[deleted]
2,rpy9wn,[deleted]
3,rpy9wn,"I think being into our culture is fine, but the point where our culture is being used as a fashion statement or being fetishized... is just gross. White people trying yellow face bothers me immensely"
4,rpy9wn,"They are the same people that tell me that I, a Filipino, am not Asian 🤨"
5,rpy9wn,I don't mind as long as they don't try to take ownership of some facet of Asian culture. Appreciation is one thing; trying to out-Asian Asians and flaunting it is quite another.
6,rpy9wn,"As a young, adopted, Asian American guy, girls who @ me about anime get hard stopped immediately. Anime is fine. I appreciate its cultural significance but it's just not my go to. People on dating apps have opened up with questions about anime and I just move on. 

Also, white people assuming to understand various Asian cultures based on the 5 anime shows they binge watch is so cringe."
7,rpy9wn,"Somewhat. It’s fine if they like the cultures (really it’s more so just the media and food they like) but when they start claiming it and become “Asia experts”, then it starts becoming problematic 

The worse kinds are those obsessed with Asian cultures but hate the people (e.g. I’ve seen plenty of Koreaboos claim that Korean people are rude and racist 🙄)"
8,rpy9wn,"Sanrio, Anime, music is super cool, so if teens wanna make it their personality I can see why; a lot of teenagers I knew growing up (myself included) did the same thing with MCR or The Office or Sherlock. It’s fun to feel included in a community or fandom as a kid, and media like anime/kpop enables that.

Because I feel like there are much more egregious anti Asian sentiments, People who are love anime/Asian pop culture, but are ignorant of the cultural context it takes place in, sometimes just need a gentle reminder when they make a mistake."
9,rpy9wn,"I am only uncomfortable if they feel like they actually have authority or own that part of the culture they enjoy. One thing I hate more is actually those who are super into our culture, but won't back us up when issues happen in our community like the rising tide of Asian hate."
10,rpy9wn,I mean it’s certainly a red flag when it comes to dating
11,rpy9wn,"I have no problem if they really appreciate the culture and come at it with humility and respect. Humility that they are in a position of learning about the culture (and not in a position to teach it), and respect for the people of the culture. It really goes for anyone learning any culture, really. I'd expect that an Asian dude who loves Spanish tv shows and music and respects the culture/people to be treated much better by Latin people than an Asian dude who loves the same Spanish pop culture but talks down about the people."
12,rpy9wn,[deleted]
13,rpy9wn,"Sometimes. If they would rather choose to engage with East Asian culture instead of their own then thats super weird, and that seems like the case for the majority of these people, not connecting or acknowledging their own. I also hate it when they put East Asians on a pedestal and fetishize them. I've experienced this sometimes (half ea, half sea) and it always gives me the ick. I tend to avoid non-Asians who are super into EA."
14,rpy9wn,"It’s turned into a subculture. Just like how skaters, jocks,  nerds or whatever were a thing 10-20 years ago. “Asian” is now a subculture — and yes it does have a creepy / fetishising vibe to it."
15,rpy9wn,"As someone who was a child in the eighties it feels weird to have been called out for eating onigiri at lunch and now non Asians people are explaining what onirazu is to me. Back then anime wasn’t widely available and we had to rent the vhs from the local Japanese video store in town. Now people are disappointed when I’m not familiar with more current anime. 

Also it doesn’t happen often but sometimes people will treat me like being Asian is the only thing about me like bruh we can talk about things other than anime and ramen. 

Or when people MUST KNOW what type of Asian I am right off the bat because they somehow think it will tell them everything about me. Or worse try to guess. 

As time goes on these experiences have lessened thankfully. I feel like with forums like these people get a different perspective."
16,rpy9wn,"The only other thing that bothers me besides everything that people have mentioned here is on Youtube, I see so many videos that are like ""White guy speaks perfect \[Asian language\], surprises locals!"" I hate those videos. Usually the white guy isn't even that fluent but the Asians are just complimenting him to be nice and the video spins it as some kind of pwn. 

Since I'm working on my language skills, I get language-learning youtube recommendations also. I've also noticed that the majority of non-Asians who have language/culture channels are white guys. I'm sure they studied hard and whatnot, but I'm still wary of them. It just feels like every white guy learns a foreign language and decides to make a Youtube channel about it to place himself as an authority to new learners."
17,rpy9wn,"I don’t think your hyper sensitive. I’m south Asians and my best friend is an attractive korean dude,  and he’s gotten tired of trying to date. He always tells me about woman fetishizing him and K-pop culture and how they go on for houses about K-pop and say he’s weird for rejecting K-pop and shit. Ironically he’s a great singer and went to school for music so they always say shit like oh you could easily be a K-pop star and etc, even though he gives two fucks about K-pop. It’s uncomfortable for him because he’s fetishized"
18,rpy9wn,"Depends. If they genuinely like that stuff (K-Pop, anime, movies and TV shows, etc) then it’s perfectly fine, but I don’t appreciate the whole “whaaaattt how can you be ASIAN if you don’t even like KPOP or anime???? Poser!” I just watched an episode of 90 Day Fiancé where a white American woman expresses jealousy that her friend decided to marry a Thai man despite the friend not being into “Asian things” like anime. Like, maybe she just loves her husband for his personality and not purely because he’s Asian."
19,rpy9wn,They’re not really interested in just “east Asia” they’re interested in Japan and Korea. While they completely ignore China lol
20,rpy9wn,There's a big difference between interest and exotification.
21,rpy9wn,"Honestly... I stopped caring so much. If they're into the culture, in a good a way, I'll interact and encourage. If not, I just ignore and avoid.There's too many people and too little time to be uncomfortable about it all."
22,rpy9wn,"i’ve definitely been uncomfortable with those examples you’ve listed. i’ve even had a friend IRL try to act as if they knew more about my culture than i did, which is upsetting since i wasn’t exempt from teasing growing up about my eyes or my food etc. 

there’s also something i’ve found disturbing lately, that certain asian languages are “acceptable” while others aren’t. take anime for example, i’ve seen plenty comment that japanese is the only acceptable asian language just because of anime. i’ve seen this with korean and k-pop as well. i’ve even let myself engage in conversation with someone like this to understand why everything else sounds disgusting to them, which wasn’t good for my mental health for sure. i don’t like how non-asians can consume one part of asian pop culture and suddenly think that it somehow makes that asian country superior to all the other countries. the romanticism/fetishization of these cultures annoys me to no end"
23,rpy9wn,"U feel uncomfortable bc they are
1) using ur culture for fun without actually having to live life as a minority. 

2) they see u as 2-D when u are a 3-D human being

3) Asians don't gatekeep appropriately. I think this is seriously bad for a certain reason. Gatekeeping forces others to understand others struggles and call attention to them. African Americans do this to whyte girls that love rap and braids but don't try to understand their struggles."
24,rpy9wn,"It does. Honestly, I would feel uncomfortable even if they were hardcore (but reasonable and non-racist) k-pop fans. I guess uncomfortable is not the right word to describe it; I just feel kind of judgey. Like, you're not Asian but you're so into these Asian oppas?? I recognize that this is part of the racism that lies within me and I won't try to defend myself for that. I never outright voice my opinions, though, because I know it's not right to be prejudiced, but the environment that I grew up in raised me to be, as if it was wired. Curious if anyone gets a bit judgey about it too."
25,rpy9wn,[deleted]
26,rpy9wn,"As a Korean, I honestly have no issue with people embracing Korean culture. The crossing of the line comes when people try to ""become Korean"" \*cough cough Oil London\* when their understanding of Korean culture is basically what they see on TV and music videos. Celebrating one's culture and racial identity is a good thing regardless of who does it. Trying alter your appearance and identifying as another culture is another thing that really shouldn't be tolerated."
27,rpy9wn,"As non Japanese non Korean, when they talk about those, I don't feel anything, like how I don't feel anything when they say they like French movies or Latino soap operas. It's not my culture and not much to do with me. Japanese or Koreans might feel differently tho."
28,rpy9wn,"No, I usually don't care if people are super into east Asian culture like K-pop, kimchi, sushi, or language.  I feel like in a country like the US where so many cultures coexist, cross-cultural interest is bound to happen.  

The only way I would feel uncomfortable or offended is if they are disrespectful or racist."
29,rpy9wn,"Genuine interest = Good. 

Misuse, Not."
30,rpy9wn,Depends on the context.  Fetishization and arrogance is creepy and somewhat upsetting to any human regardless of race.
31,rpy9wn,"Yes, in a way.

If you like anime or asian culture, good for you! But if you expect me to know every obscure little anime because of me being part jp, thats a little far. If you are trying to base your personality on a japanese kawaii cutesy style, I’d probably give you a weird look and say ‘ook..?’ 
Obviously fetishizing and trying to ACTUALLY BE ASIAN is crossing the line. Also speaking for asia/asian people and trying to ‘be more asian, than an asian is… super weird and wrong."
32,rpy9wn,"kinda depends tbh. if they’re just curious and aren’t appropriating imo it’s ok, but if they practically want to be a person of that ethnicity but only cherry-pick stuff from the culture, then it’s problematic and makes me feel iffy. ik this person who’s a weeb and is really into japanese culture, which is fine, but she’s always asking me if *insert something* is cultural appropriation (and more than half the time she doesn’t know the context and just thinks it’s cool) while knowing i’m chinese, which is kinda dumb. 

my SO’s mom is also interested in my culture, but more in the way of “how can i take aspects of it and twist it to fit my agenda?” she’s also one of those people who think asia is just china, japan, and korea, and those countries’ cultures are the same, so whenever there’s something she thinks is “asian,” she’ll ask me to give her info on it. she also covid-blames and thinks my and “my people” drink piss as medicine, so it bothers me someone like her wants to learn about my culture, since so far she’s spewing bullshit to others about the symbolism of jade dragons and doing various things that essentially shit on my culture.

idk why that ended up being so long"
33,rpy9wn,"I find it weird, especially the people who think being a weeaboo is a good thing or something to be proud of (it has never been a good thing). I’ve seen cars decked out in anime decals and I just know they’re not Asian because no Asian person I know of is that OBSESSED with anime that it’s their entire personality. If I see a car full of anime decals I call it a “weeb mobile”."
34,rpy9wn,"Yes. I’ve always found it weird. There’s a difference between actually appreciating the culture and the creepy white girls who obsess over kpop and anime and move to Asia just for the sole purpose of getting an Asian boyfriend. They have no real appreciation for the culture or the people, they just have an Asian fetish. Myself and all the Asians I know also find it uncomfy"
35,rpy9wn,Lol I also feel super uncomfortable with yoga practicing people who think Hinduism is some spiritual cure for your modern disease and burn through incense like they are some Indian Raj. It's fine if you do it as a hobby but don't let it define who you are.

yes."
37,rpy9wn,"I stay the fuck away from these people. 
Yea, others will give them the benefit of the doubt but I have no patience for them.
You gotta be kidding if these are the same people who are affected by or even truly care about the discrimination and hate we face. 
Most times they will never understand it bc they’ll never personally experience it. 
The culture we grew up with is only a trend to them. They seek us out when it’s convenient but once they lose interest, we mean nothing. 
There’s a difference between appreciating and knowing your place and staying there versus appropriating and making a mockery out of the culture and the people. 
So you are entitled to feel uncomfortable and I advise that the minute they entertain the idea of tokenizing you, you use your brain and gtfo."

39,rpy9wn,"As for KPOP, it was [designed to attract global attention,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_wave) so that one doesn't bother me as much as some of the other things mentioned. As a recovering weeb, I feel for these people."
40,rpy9wn,"No not really. It's the same with Asian American kids adopting AAVE as slang, or getting Black or White fashion, or going out of their way to adopt the aspects of Asian culture not of their heritage as part of their personal identity.

It's a fad, and people will get over it with time. 

I'm more concerned with useless gatekeeping, the superiority complex that Asian Americans have with relation to actual Asian cultures in Asia, and anti-Asian racism. Correcting a doofus or cringe teenagers isn't worth my time. I still remember that Korean American movie director who hates that Korean men are depicted as they are in pop culture because of the effect on Koreans/Asians in the USA. Or the time when everyone jumped on some random woman for wearing Chinese-inspired clothing to prom, while people actually from China were okay with it because they viewed it as an introduction and representation to their culture in a setting not of their own. 

I'm more concerned about the ongoing treatment of Chinese-Americans as potential spies for the CCP (especially without real compensation for innocent people), and the pandemic allowing people to hate on Asians just as stupidly and irrationally as they did against Muslims after 9/11. Or let's talk about yellow fever or pedophile sexpates. 

Crowds of clueless, self-important teenagers and the occasional weirdo like Oli London are frankly the equal to teenagers from Japan, Taiwan, China, Indonesia, South Korea, or Thailand wearing literal Nazi propaganda. 

Stupid, but ultimately harmless and unaware. I can save my anger for better things."
41,rpy9wn,"So I took my niece to the BTS concert in LA for her bday, not really knowing the fan demographic. I joined the quora and Reddit message boards prior to the concert so I know what to expect as far as lines, where to park, how early to get there. I was baffled that the the majority of the fans were non-Asian women - specifically women fetishizing, these young men. I’m very happy that BTS broken into an English speaking market, but what bothered me is that a lot of the fans on the message boards don’t understand stand a lick of Korean and understand Korean and Asian culture.

I came across a post of someone, most likely not Asian, disputing whether or not some of the BTS members were full Korean and other fans agreeing. The ignorance and incompetence baffles me. Google is at your fingertips to research Asian cultures, specifically Korean culture, but these non Asians love to spout their “Asian expertise” on the internet."
42,rpy9wn,"I agree with alot of the other comments on here. There's genuine interest in a culture which is ok and then there are people who become obsessed with some part of the culture and think they're experts, ie. Bruce Lee, k beauty, music, food, even religion (Buddhism). 

I wonder though if Americans do this to all cultures to some degree. As much xenophobia and prejudice and ignorance exists here, I've encountered people who LOVE anything French (macarons, brands, would love to visit Paris, etc.) Or anything British. You get the idea. But it's often surface level. I've known a lot of Europeans because of my work and none have ever said anything even closely similar. A desire to live in NYC or a fascination with American culture (not necessarily for positive reasons) perhaps but that's about it."
43,rpy9wn,"I avoid coming off as super into any non Korean things. I mean, someone being into a particular anime or K-Pop group is fine regardless of racial background (well as fine as someone from the appropriate culture being super into it), but it becomes very strange and off putting when a person is super into an entire medium or genre; being a 2NE1 Stan is fine, being a K-Pop stan/Koreaboo is not.

Honestly, I am uncomfortable with non-Koreans being super into Korean stuff, like K-Pop (or other music genres), dramas, fashion, and so on. This applies to other Asians, too. Most obsessive, or, at the least, cringey, K-Pop stans I've interacted with have been Chinese or Vietnamese Americans, though there are a lot of White, Hispanic, and Black Americans, too, who are the same way.

However, I will say, I feel more *threatened* when non-Korean Asians do this. And this is simply because, and only in my experience, a minority of these Asian American individuals outright or come off as ""claiming"" it, as in aspects of Korean culture, as part of their culture or some pan-Asian American culture."
44,rpy9wn,I’m Chinese and no not at all. Culture is meant to be shared
45,rpy9wn,"I was wondering if anyone else felt this way, so thanks for sharing your thoughts.  There's something uniquely bothersome about a non-Asian (who obviously hasn't experienced living in Asian diaspora) adopting or claiming customs/fashions/etc that come from a culture entirely outside of their experience.  It's like they're trying to enjoy the look without having to live with what's behind it -- that being a history of Asian cultures being appropriated for profit, Asians in diaspora being pressured to assimilate and give up said look/customs, fetishization, etc -- even if that's not the intent."
46,rpy9wn,"The world is bigger than you think. Yes there's always going to be people who make fun of those ""asian things' but on the other side, there's always going to be people who embrace it. I wouldnt mix those two communities together

I look at this as if we have interests of our own. Im Chinese but love the hip hop culture. It's heavily influenced of the Black community and in my experience, there's different sides of people who love that I love it or concerning and just think that I want to be black. 

Let people be them. Even if they have total yellow fever, whatever. For sure there's Asian girls who only date white guys and so on."
47,rpy9wn,"I think you are hyper-sensitive.  

Their interests and likes don't really affect your day-to-day life.  You are *choosing* to be upset at something they like.  You are assuming their reasons for liking something East Asian is from something negative or hateful.  Rather than from pure appreciation.

Why should any East Asian be the gatekeeper on who gets like what or participates in things in their culture?  

Just as I like the Nordic design; should some Nordic people tell me that it's comfortable for them if I were to decorate my room with nordic furniture and home accessories?  Or tell me that I can't move to a Nordic city to live there for 2 years because I like their design culture and want to learn more about it?  If anything, I would think that the Nordic person is the one with prejudice and bias, if I was told them I was really into the Nordic culture.

If other people are really into east Asian culture stuff, then be happy for them.  Be happy that they are happy.  Be happy that somebody appreciates some east Asian creators's work.  Be happy that somebody from another culture has something in common with you."
48,rpy9wn,"Absolutely not, I see nothing wrong with any of these. 

You're right on this

But this isn't the burden of some random white person enjoying an interest. I'm not going to gatekeep them on the basis of race"
49,rpy9wn,"I am usually instinctually uncomfortable, but it depends on the person. Also fox eyes are hot so I don't mind people who do them."
50,rpy9wn,"No. I don't care what other people's passions are and neither should anyone else. It's a wierd gate keeping thing to me to not allow people to like a culture they aren't a part of. 

Now, I realize that some people will jump onto a band wagon when things get popular and some of those people are really fucking shitty. That's the case with literally every fad or interest. But I think the more exposure that Asian culture gets, the better."

53,rpy9wn,"I have nothing against non-Asian people being into East Asian cultures as long as it is done respectfully.  The problem are the types that latch onto a distorted image of such culture based on their limited experience (ex. those who spent a week in Asia or expats who lived in a bubble, weebs whose only exposure to Japanese people is anime or the otaku bubble, etc.) and then feeling entitled to speak on behalf of all Asians and Asian descendants."
54,rpy9wn,"Nope, not at all. We don't own our culture. Yes, it is ours, but everyone is free to engage with it. Plus, since you're an Asian American I have a feeling you appropriate plenty of cultures on a daily basis. However, that isn't a bad thing. Accept that we are all human and move on."
55,rpy9wn,"I’m half Asian and love exploring/talking about different facets of Asian culture, such as Southeast Asian history, Taiwanese food, Kdramas, etc. I’ve sometimes been accused of being one of these people, and also at times by non-Asians (some of whom also try to be spokespeople for Asians). This is partly because I look ethnically ambiguous, but whatever. It’s frustrating, and I just want to be able to appreciate my heritage in peace. I think cultural appreciation is great, but I would also rather people really try to understand Asian countries and genuinely get to know people from said countries before acting like experts."
56,rpy9wn,I don't care. The whole concept of cultural appropriation is fucking dumb anyways. I'll appropriate any damn culture I please tyvm. The only people who guard stuff like this are just people who are insecure as hell about themselves or idk lack critical thinking capabilities.

8,kx25m1,"If anyone's interested, I live nearby and I don't know anything about the crime but I have some context about Milwaukee.

Washington Park is a hub of this part of Milwaukee, sort of a near west slash near north side of town. It is the border between a mostly middle class white and mostly working class Black section of the city. However, it is also a hub of Southeast Asian residents, mostly descended from refugees (large Hmong community).

Washington Park used to be considered a very dangerous area, but a nonprofit, Urban Ecology Center, moved in and began environmental and science programming at the park. It's also massive, the crown jewel in socialist city planners a century ago that believed in working class access to green space - it used to be the zoo before it was a park. This usage and community center pushed out a lot of the criminal presence and the park has become a hub of racial integration, pulling from Black, white, and Asian communities for youth programming, which is rare here since Milwaukee is the most segregated city in the country.

This is really heartbreaking to me because it likely wouldn't take much to push people to abandon this lovely but fragile integration at this park and I have a lot of fond memories there. It's seen a lot of improvement but Milwaukee has seen one of the highest upticks in crime during the pandemic of any major city, in part because Wisconsin has been one of the worst for covid relief (rather than stopping evictions for instance we increased evictions over the summer) and the economic downturn being extraordinarily harsh (some neighborhoods, 25%+ people have lost their jobs).

0,v11dci,"""Model minority"" is just a narrative to demand Asians do other people's work for less money.

Any ""privileges"" we have are granted, to be rescinded at the whims of White folks, and I hope nobody is pretending that it's not White folks who pull the strings, who use us as a wedge and bludgeon against other people of color, who, unfortunately, are often all too susceptible to taking the bait."

Being told I was ""basically white"" and shut out if any conversations involving the very racism I faced daily was so discouraging.

Like racism to these people isn't real unless someone calls someone the n word and refuses them a job explicitly because they are black (having an Asian surname doesn't count). I feel like in the Midwest people never acknowledge anti Asian racism. It's all treated like a big joke that I was too sensitive to find funny. My kid's bio mom, who literally has zero nonwhite friends, wanted my kid to attend a much worse school district because she said it was more ""diverse"". That school district only had black students and white students. She was trying to take him out of a district with a large South Asian and North African immigrant community. Because apparently ""diversity"" doesn't include Asians or immigrants. Luckily he didn't have to move. But she was constantly threatening it. She would say all this ""woke"" stuff and be so mad I was not willing to endanger my kid to take him to bad areas of the city, saying it would expose him to other cultures when I am the one who would take him to Chinese cultural events and later to China.

8,v11dci,"What is the attachment to the perpetually imperfect moniker of ""Asian American?"" Most of the best arguments against treating AAPI folx like a monolith focus on poverty and education rates, which are, from what I have seen, largely changed when you introduce non-East Asian and some select South Asian ethnicities. If you are East Asian or of certain South Asian (which still have to deal with colorism and distance from the rest of the less melanated Asian countries) ethnicities, how do you connect to the plight of Hmong people, or Burmese refugees, or Samoans? Why do you connect to them?

Further, what about the families that have been here since the 1800s, or even survivors of the WWII camps, like my family? What kind of representation do we get, and how does our plight intersect with the post-1965 immigrants? This is not to suggest pan-Asian solidarity isn't important, or worthy, but more so to highlight the nuances and difficulties of ever moving the narrative forward without answering these questions.

I'm also just missing the point - I don't understand this article. He literally says, ""I had gotten used to not always thinking about what it means to have my ethnicity in the spotlight, or even front of mind."" How is this not a privilege? White people aren't the only ones forwarding the model minority narrative - this man's success and safety was changed once COVID hit, but what if it hadn't? Wasn't he also contributing to the model minority paradigm by recognizing that he had gotten used to not keeping his ethnicity front of mind?

Hiding in our homes lets them win. After two years of struggling with these fears - ordering delivery and becoming agoraphobic I insisted on taking back existing in public. The first time was hard.

I can understand how you must be feeling. The sad truth is, your family and non-POC friends are not going to truly understand you, but like others said, you can seek out other POC friends if there are any in your community, or DM me anytime. I had a Vietnamese friend all through middle and high school (and we’re still BFFs today) but we first bonded as two of the only Asian students in our school.

I know that feeling heard and validated in your very understandable anxiety and fear is important. Have you tried to sit down and talk honestly with your parents? I’m well into my 30s and have had many blunt conversations with mine. Sometimes adoptive parents see us as “theirs” so much they forget that we are actually not — that we are not the same race, that we have history and lineage and ancestors that came before them that have nothing to do with them. We are our own person. And that person is perceived as Other in white supremacist America. It’s not your job, but if you want them to wake up, you’ll have to educate them. And I highly recommend learning about CRT, sociology of Race and Ethnicity, the deep rooted systemic racism of the US (assuming you’re American, but learn about it for whatever country you live in, they all have skeletons) — that really helped me contextualize where the hate comes from and why, as well as educate others.

Nowadays, my parents are much more woke, liberal, and politically savvy, although not perfect, they try, and have come lightyears from where they started. Because my brother and I talked with them about our experiences often. Good luck and DM me whenever if you want to chat."

Yes, your white family is going to be unaware. White people do not think about racism much, in general. The only time they hear about racism is when a Harry from accounting gets fired because he was racist, or when Joe Rogan has to apologize for being racist on the radio.  They only hear about exceptional circumstances that make the news. 

They never experience the little things, they don't get told to go home, they don't get ignored or snubbed by the majority, they do not experience microaggressions that in themselves are not a huge deal, but they are annnnnnoooooyying because you experience them every fucking week.

However whenever a minority asks if a certain place is safe/comfortable for them to be in or instances of microaggressions (or just straight up aggressions) they've experienced, their concerns are always dismissed. The replies are always they're too paranoid and they shouldn't be offended about everything. Then another hate crime occurs and rinse and repeat. 

I'm not paranoid to the point of not wanting to go outside, but minorities having bad feelings about things and instincts kicking in is completely valid. You notice the subtle things telling you these people/situations are sketchy. A lot of white people won't believe you unless they literally see ""I'm racist"" tattooed on the forehead."

It's never happened to me personally.  But that's probably because I'm a big guy.  I do recognize that most attacks on Asian Americans are women.


Unfortunately, empathy needs to be taught sometimes.  Your mom is a woman.  Even though she isn't asian, she must understand how the world treats women at times.  I'm guessing she isn't paranoid and she isn't asian.  She won't understand what that's like in America.  But she could understand being talked down, ignored, or more easily harrassed just because she is a woman."

I hope for your sake that they will recognize reality but they might be super delusional (and white people tend to be coddled when they are delusional)."
10,usc0r4,"`One of my friends noticed how nervous I've become, and when I told her why, she told me that I didn't have to worry about hate crimes being committed against me because I'm Korean, not Chinese. First of all, being Chinese doesn't justify any hate crime, and second of all, I think we all know that it literally doesn't matter what ""type"" of Asian you are. We all get generalized into the same group.`

I just...can't..I presume this friend is White? Gosh. That comment is so invalidating. Since when do people pay attention to different Asian ethnicities. I agree. Being Chinese does not justify hate crimes. But commenting on what your friend said about feeling safe cause you're Korean and not Chinese....

A racist fucker of whatever racial BG is not going to stop you and say, ""Oh, wait. You're not Chinese? You're Korean? Sorry, my bad. Be on your merry way. I'm only after Chinese folks.""

The Latino teen who stabbed a Burmese American family because he thought they were responsible for COVID-19 didn't stop to think that. 

The Black homeless dude who followed a Korean American woman into her apt and killed her didn't take her Korean ethnicity into account. He was just after an easy target - a ""submissive, quiet, Asian woman.""

The White shooter in Atlanta went after Asian women - he didn't target Chinese specifically.  

The countless examples of racist neo Whites who call anyone who looks East Asian  ""china virus"" or ""wuhan flu"" ....we're all the same to them. 

Sorry you have color blind friends."

12,usc0r4,"fellow asian adoptee here (albeit not Korean though) to a white family. i’ve noticed that a lot of times they just don’t see us as asian, in a much deeper way than when white people say “they don’t see color.” they raised us, and by proximity, we have mainly been coded as white in their eyes (like someone else mentioned, they see us as “theirs”). i find that when confronted with the notion that we are, actually, not white and have faced vastly different life experiences because of it, they have to actively challenge their cognitive thinking which can be really difficult, and often times they’ll just take the easier way out and continue to deny your identity. i don’t have any particular words of advice other than taking the time to talk to them about it, as others have mentioned, but i just wanted to let you know that you’re not alone :)"

15,usc0r4,"I think you should sit your family down and explain to them calmly how these recent events are affecting you, they will take you more seriously.

 I also think you shouldn't discourage them from inviting u out, but let you choose and not to pressure you. This way when you feel more comfortable you can slide outside.

If they fail to understand, you can compare the situation to the situation in South Africa. White farmers are being killed because they are white and are perceived to have stolen the land from black ppl (whether this is true or not is not what I'm talking about) but basically, emphasis that they are being killed primarily for their skin colour


Generally, it's mostly elderly women or single women who are being attacked but youll probably be okay in a group. Up to you.

Good luck"

19,usc0r4,"Your fears are so valid, and I think seeking out a therapist is an excellent idea! I don't have any solid advice really, since I'm trying to figure this out myself with my white friends (Although I imagine it's a lot more difficult as an adoptee with a white family). It'll probably be a while before they understand (and the reality is, they may never understand...) In the meantime, are there any communities near you that are predominantly BIPOC? For me, I joined a very diverse and justice oriented running group and spending time with them makes me feel safer and understood."
20,usc0r4,"I'm sorry you're experiencing this. After the pandemic started, I pretty much stopped going out alone. I'm used to being harassed in public, but I was never as scared as I became during the pandemic. My Caucasian husband and I want to have children but I feel so much anxiety about the future for them. He's not dismissive of how I feel, but I wouldn't say he understands or sympathizes either."
21,usc0r4,Yea for sure. racist don’t care what Asian you are. They’re just looking for a reason to attack you. Even before Covid you can see a lot of hate right here on Reddit.
22,usc0r4,"Living in fear of what may or may not happen is no way of living life.  Work out, take some self-defense classes, build up the cardio (to run), learn mindfulness, and do the therapy (if you have the budget).  

If you stated to your family why you didn't want to go out with them those times; then the awareness of Why you declined is there.  But from their POV; what is the best way to respond or do for you in this case?  Is it to enable your behavior have you stay home?  Or build up your confidence and have you feel safe by being with you, and going out to places?   They are not telling you to go out by yourself.  

I highly recommend doing Tim Ferris's fear setting exercises:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5J6jAC6XxAI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5J6jAC6XxAI)

My intent isn't to come off as harsh, I hope you can overcome the fear."
23,usc0r4,"Ok so as much as I’m aware about the attacks on diaspora like us, I feel inclined to point out that the risk of you being attacked sort of pales against the likelihood of you feeling regret over not living life with your family as much as you could when they were still alive.

I know that Asian Americans are under attack and that it doesn’t matter if we’re Chinese or Korean, we’re all the same to a racist: but it doesn’t mean that we should let the fear of racists attacking us hang over our heads and block us from living our lives. It’s good that you’re seeking out therapy for your anxiety (as I have myself with depression etc), but I feel that they’ll likely suggest incremental exposure to the factors that your anxiety originates from. So maybe walking with your Mom in NYC might have *some* risk, but the benefit of informed confidence that it’ll give you from probably not being attacked will help ease your anxiety a lot more than what a pill could do.

Lastly, as a matter of pride as an Asian American, I want to reiterate that so long as we live in North America, we will continue to stand our ground as we’ve been doing for centuries. Have a basic plan on what to do if confronted by a racist and share it with your family, but do not let the racists take joy from your life. There is nothing that repudiates their bigotry more than them seeing us live confidently and be successful, even in the wake of their hate."
24,usc0r4,Oh my god I feel for you. I went to nyc the other day to go shopping and the minute I got there my heart was THUMPING. I was wearing this bucket hat with a small Korean flag on it and got so paranoid that I was going to get punched in the back of the head so I took it off. Everything was completely fine and I’m also working on it. I come from a WHHIIIITE area so i have this frustration too. Just know that your feelings are validated and remind yourself when you are safe. It’s so hard to accept that there are people with legitimately no fear. Take your time.

Maybe things are getting better but I remember just going around in NYC, we used to enjoy taking th subway but because of hate crimes and crimes in general, we drive everywhere. Depending where in NYC, I would not go there to walk regardless what race I am. Your friends comment is the worst...doesn't seem too bright."

Your struggles are very real and I feel for you."
31,usc0r4,"I'm so sorry your loved ones are completely failing you. Everything you're feeling is totally valid. I grew up in a place that was extremely dangerous for Asians and I still get the same feelings you do. The only advice I have is to make sure you get as close a specialist to your background (family, adopted, immigrant/first-gen Asian, all the ways you identify) and as high a certification (PsyD) as possible.

Been there, went through many, still don't have a therapist that has been as helpful as extremely specific and very few peers in my community.

Listen to your gut and do your best to heal/find a way to ground yourself from there. Your reality is very different from theirs, and you don't need their extra shit on top of yours. You need a safe space - whether it be writing, therapy, a trusted friend, etc. This is sadly a common experience for displaced folks (first-gen kids in the diaspora etc). The priority is to create your own space where YOU feel valid, safe and that you belong, even if it's just yourself for the time being. That.. and maybe it's time to figure out how to lay some healthy boundaries with your ""loved ones."" 👀
You matter just as much. The next time they gaslight you.. however you need to word it, hold them accountable. They're supposed to care and take measures that you feel safe. 👀 Hold them to it and if they insist on not understanding, dehumanizing and generally being toxic with you.. well. Again, healthy boundaries. Sad and painful as it is, it's not uncommon for people in your shoes to remove toxic people from their lives, too. Your health, safety, humanity and happiness is more important."

I could go on and on (and I have) about the rejection I've experienced from Japanese communities (both in Japan and the States), as well as other ""monoracial"" Asians being skeptical or uncomfortable around me.

I absolutely do not deny my privilege in this country as someone who can sometimes slip within some white groups seemingly without much notice. I know this because some white people have commented that I just look ""a little off"" but, because they just know me on a first name basis and don't know my Japanese given name (which is listed as my ""middle name""), they just attribute it to something else, since I don't ""look Asian"" or ""sound Asian"" to them. However, I don't hide my feelings about white supremacy and it's satisfying when I befuddle a bigot. I don't hide behind my whiteness or worse, hide behind my Asian heritage to encourage bigotry (see Lauren Chen), which is a concern I've heard voiced from many monoracial Asians. I would get in a damn fist fight to protect a fellow Asian American from an attack. However, would an Asian American do the same for me? Based on my experience, likely not.

I hope articles like this are indicative of change. As someone who has experienced a lifetime of rejection by the Asian American community, it gives me hope.

1,pf5k3n,"I legitimately thought she was Latina, so that's awesome to find out!"
2,pf5k3n,"I think this brings up the interesting topic of identity vs representation. 

I don't have a  sociology background but to me they are different in that identity is created by and applied to oneself whereas representation is how you are perceived, and of course they may influence each other and both may change over time.

There is nothing wrong with OR identifying as AAPI, but I can also understand how ""full"" Asians can feel not completely represented by her or other mixed-race Asians (especially when they're white passing or ""ethnically ambiguous"") in the media because, simply, they don't look ""full"" Asian (all racial groups probably feel this to some extent). 

I think big picture, it's baby steps. We're seeing more ""full"" Asians represented in main stream media nowadays then we have in the past, but it's going to take time. 

[Key and Peele did a humorous sketch on the observation that British actors were often cast to play black characters in American media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgYfRGDiPDs&ab_channel=Key%26Peele), which is sorta a switcharoo of what we're talking about.

She had fantastic cultural segments while on Disney Channel, but has had little mention of this since her newfound popularity, to the point where many aren’t even aware she’s Asian. Her production team (notably co-writer Dan Negro and music video producer Petra Collins) is also primarily White, so truthfully there has been little to no semblance of her culture in her work, too. Of course she is not obligated to integrate her heritage with her work at all, but I personally would love to see it."
4,pf5k3n,"As a pinay, this is a conversation I’ve often had with many of my friends, since there are so so many mixed race filipinos (I believe there was a study done that showed we are the most likely to marry outside of our race?).

There’s a nuanced conversation to be had here that is often difficult to have on online articles. 

1) It is incredibly bothersome that white or “ambiguous” looking Filipino’s are always heralded as representation for our community in both the US while dominating movie and tv screens, beauty campaigns, etc in the Philippines. As a non-ambiguous, Brown pinay I have felt incredibly frustrated being told I need to look up to people who, due to the way they’re are racialized, experience their ethnic/racial identity very differently than I do. For example, I remember there was a time where Hailey Steinfeld was super popular; she’s great but as a brown person she does not resonate with me. 

2. That being multiracial and Filipino doesn’t make you less Filipino; same goes for other identities. However, it’s still important to be cognizant to be aware of your positionality. For example, filipinos who are paler and/or racialized as white should not be centered in conversations around colorism. 

3. That in conversations about multiracial Filipinos, filipinos who have a white parent AND look white/or look “ambiguous” dominate the conversation, despite the numerous filipinos who are also Black, Latino, Indigenous, etc. In the US I often see Olivia Rodrigo, Dave Bautista, Vanessa Hudgens heralded as Filipino representation while Saweetie and HER are not. It’s not hard to see why."

Secondly, she had expectations she would have been able to send money to her parents to fix up their homes, change their life, and what she saw when she returned was her inability to do so because of his fucking parents.

1,j079i8,"I always knew this when HK protests first came to light. Them waving British colonial flags basically reaffirmed the beliefs among Conservative types that colonialism was good along with the rampant white savior complex.

I also don’t appreciate how HK protestors willingly let themselves be used to undermine BLM protests. Or how they attempted to add fuel to COVID-19 related anti-racism and posting racist memes. Joshua Wong, who’s the supposed leader of these protests, literally posted “bat soup” memes. This gave racists the green light. Not to mention him sucking up to GOP senators. Or in the rHongKong sub, there’s a large number of white supremacists and Trump supporters. I hope they understand that you don’t have to contribute to the oppression of others, in order to free yourself from oppression."

3,j079i8,"Born in HK and raised in the US, this article shares the same sentiment as me regarding how moving away from HK doesn’t necessary solve all problems; racism js still a prominent issue among aa and our voices aren’t as loud as other minorities."
4,j079i8,"hong kongers aren't exactly innocent. They been ragging on mainland migrants since the 50s. They called them locusts and treated mainlanders as 2nd class. So now that Shenzhen is outshining HK, they cry foul."
5,j079i8,"Disclaimer. I'm Asian but not American.

It was the HK protests that finally put irrefutable proof in my face of racism against Asians by the so called west, particularly UK and US.

I am not from China too, but I'm sure for no reason other than my skin color, I will be caught in this sinophobia storm coming out of the US."
6,j079i8,"As a north american asian who now lives in the  UK, there is some truth in this. However, representation of the asian diaspora is far more ahead in north america (even then- only parts of!). But overall- things are getting better and London is a hodge podge of cultures. Sure its not perfect"
7,j079i8,"I think the key sophistry in this article is the claim that HKers idolize the UK when the meat of the article is personal examples of how the UK is racist to HK immigrants (which is fine and undeniable). I think the fact that the author is a HK writer says a lot about this sort of implicit propaganda that makes it out to mainstream American media like the Atlantic. If the author wants to argue that HKers romanticize the colonizers, she should actually make the case by providing examples. Otherwise it's a pretty unscrupulous move, because CPP propagandists already constantly repeat  the spurious rationalization that the West is racist as a justification that HK dissenters should not turn to the West. By not arguing the author's stated case, the author effectively helps the CPP platform this propaganda.

That aside, I think there can be case to be made about HKer's role in social inequality, and what amounts to an issue of internalized colonialism. But that would require evidence and nuanced consideration of different historical and political contexts."

The reason is pretty simple... but no one likes to say it."

But even back in the early 2000s, people noticed the disparity between Asian male and female broadcast journalists."
2,sw5hzu,People don't like Asian men on TV that's why. Because people are racist. Sad cold truth.
3,sw5hzu,"My unvetted theorem here is that media companies want their male anchors to project a sense of authority and gravitas, and their female anchors to appear friendly but serious. Asian females and their still-problematic representation in popular culture over the years are able to fit into the latter, but many Asian males due to their ongoing representation in fairly hackneyed and unflattering ways are still not seen as having these desired attributes. This is slowly changing, but has a long way to go."

If all the people trying to be mysterious about why women succeed are trying to imply that Asian women fuck their way up to the top, I highly doubt it because ime this gender gap existed in high school/college where the bar for participation in student journalism was just showing up to meetings regularly.

I was never the smartest but always worked hard to help the customer and across org. I never accept complacency whether it is the quality of work from my team or my working environment.  I think being assertive is the hardest for Asian Americans. I'm somewhat a 1.5 generation but grew up in a very international environment (outside the US)."
4,8ns194,"I commented in another thread some time ago about my situation where I'd been in the IT area for my entire work career.  I was in the military and after taking a mandatory aptitude test was assigned as computer programmer/analyst when the field was in its infancy back in the 1950s.  I was recruited by IBM, NCR and Sperry Rand and hired on with IBM immediately after my discharge from military service.  I was assigned to IBM's customers who leased their then new mainframe computers to assist and train their IT staffs.  Was sent to clients all over the country.  One of their clients that I assisted made me a generous offer to leave IBM and work for them.  I accepted and saw the outfit grow and branch out.  I worked for them for years but always as their chief programmer/analyst.  In over 30 years I never was offered a managerial position.  I was paid handsomely and even was paid more than anyone in the company except for the chief executives.  But I was never placed into a managerial or supervisory position ... I always their chief programmer/analyst.  Even tho I was paid more than any of my supervisors, I was never appointed as one. "
5,8ns194,"Important evidence of the continuation of racism in US society.

However let's also keep in mind that the demand here shouldn't be ""we need more Asians in management"", because that would only perpetuate hollow corporate hierarchies.  Better to work toward breaking down these hierarchies entirely.  

In addition, I never understood the people who actually want to be managers in the first place.  I'm personally determined to not get promoted into management, I'll stick with my technical positions where I can actually get my hands dirty, thank you very much."
6,8ns194,"well this sucks, i think it also depends on what industry you are in as well. i expect asian american's promotion to management to be higher in the tech industry."
7,8ns194,"In my family's case, becoming management was seen as a punishment. More responsibility and less time to do it. When I told my parents I was promoted to management, they acted sad for me. I thought they were all crazy and a product of their time, as 1st gen asian-americans. 

I saw management at the consulting firm I worked at was the way to grow and make big bucks. I pushed hard for it and got into management with ease, only to find out I really hated being management. Sure you get paid more (only slightly), but the stress and extra responsibilities (and rate dilution due to being salary, i.e., no overtime) made it all a wash. It was sorta like being a caretaker in an underfunded adult daycare.

I got out of there as soon as I could, making a lateral move to a more technical track. I get paid the same and I don't have to wipe anyone's ass but my own in the process.

Maybe it is just my experience but rising in management at a consulting firm is about how big of a shit sandwich you can eat and I didn't really want to play that game.

"
8,8ns194,"Are they excluding or taking into account to Asian-American who are foreign born? If they aren't then I can see problems with their data already.

This was in the 1950s when segregation was still the law of the land in that part of the US.  I quickly discovered that I was not welcome in a whole lot of places.  Go to a restaurant and either not be allowed in or be allowed to sit at a table and not get waited on at all.  Got to a point where I knew where I could or could not go.  So I spent a good deal of my time at YMCAs for dining or recreation.  Now here it is over 70 years later and I'm still in the same area.  I haven't been barred from entering any business establishment lately and could dine at any restaurant I choose to patronize.  This is not to say that I haven't encountered any racist crap in my wanderings.  I still get called a Chink on occasion.  Who knows, in another 70 years even that might not happen.

The episodes are profiles of chefs, and are very light on culture, social impact, and how the food relates to the broader world.

It sucks"

3,uib7nz,I was born in Fremont you dickheads
4,uib7nz,"This is just yet more confirmation that ""hate the government but not the people"" is pure bullshit. Reality is that the people who tout this line know very little about the actual government or people of any Asian country. And even if they did, there wouldn't be such considerable hate toward Asian Americans as this poll shows.

Key points to highlight:

* 21% of U.S. adults say Asian Americans are at least partly responsible for COVID, up from 11% in 2021.
* 33% believe that Asian Americans are more loyal to their country of origin than to the US. (Really, what country of origin? California?)
* Only 29% of Asian Americans responded that they feel completely accepted in the US, the lowest of all racial groups.
* Polls were conducted from March 2021 to Feb 2022. So Covid had already been raging for a year when the polls started, and yet we still see such a dramatic shift in attitude.

The article blames increased anti-China rhetoric, especially during Trump's era. While this is true, I think this is actually an easy scapegoat. The reality is that many people out there harbors these sentiments (towards all Asians, not just Chinese, they don't actually care what country), and their actions are accepted now more than ever before in recent history."

Or by deliberately minimizing the racism like saying 99% of interactions between so-and-so race and Asians are peaceful. Or pulling out crime statistics to deflect from whatever is happening or scapegoat any particular group.

This is why a few token messages on Twitter are not meaningful. It’s better to look at actual actions and the subsequent results. Just because Democrats don’t directly say the quiet part out loud doesn’t mean they don’t work against Asian American interests. If you pay close attention, you’ll find that China hawking has now become bipartisan.

Just look at how left leaning media like NYT, Bloomberg, Quartz, and NBC treats China; many times they’re more unfairly hawkish than even right leaning media like WSJ or Economist."

However, all of us minorities have one thing in common:

We are all put at some level of risk by this racist, piece of shit president. Why? Because his rhetoric energizes racists, and racists are fucking hateful morons who are not capable or even interested in telling the difference between different minorities.

A Cuban American may hear Donald talk about how Mexicans are rapists and criminals and how they need to be blocked by a 2,000-mile wall along the southern border, and go, ""Well, he's talking about Mexicans, not Cubans, so I'm golden."" Are they really golden, though? Do they think Trump supporters don't just lump all brown-skinned people with Spanish names together? Do they think a Trump supporter would never scream ""Go back to Mexico!"" to a Cuban American who was born and raised here?

A Vietnamese American may hear Donald repeatedly use the term ""China virus"" or ""Kung flu"", and think, ""Well, I'm not Chinese, so I'm golden."" Are they really golden, though? Do they think Trump supporters can tell the difference between Vietnamese and Chinese? Do they think a Trump supporter won't scream ""Go back to China!"" right at their faces?

Different minority groups aren't monoliths, but racism and the threat it poses to all of us minorities are monolithic. If a candidate is clearly racist - like Donald is - I think that should be an automatic no-vote for any minority who wants to feel safe and welcomed in this country. It's our country, too, and yet Donald has made it a lot less safe and welcoming to me and anyone else who isn't white.

Truth be told, I think some news outlets outright refuse to see a lot of things as racism.

I don't know if it's out of the personal prejudices of the reporter or they think that they're ""avoiding controversy"" by not calling it what it is, but it's a trend you see a lot more than you should in this day and age."

2,ga63fu,"Yeah I am, but it seems worth nothing the euphemisms have been used for racist stuff for a long time now beyond just Asian folks. 

Trump was rarely called racist by any of the large news outlets. NPR would talk circles around it just to avoid calling a spade a spade.

News media just backs off from using racist or hate crime, especially when it's early reporting and they really only do the early part for these things"

Regarding your last statement, I was born in another country, South Korea. But I was adopted when I was an infant and grew up in America. Would an attack on me xenophobic or racist then? What about an elderly woman who came to the US from China decades ago and has American citizenship, but doesn't speak much English or has a heavy accent? Is discriminating against her xenophobia or racism? 

Not expecting you to have all the answers, just thinking out loud."
5,ga63fu,"Speaking from the POV of someone working in news, outlets are VERY reticent to call something ""racist"" because of legal reasons; it assigns intent and people can come back with lawyers saying ""well, I didn't MEAN to be racist"" and then you've got a libel lawsuit. It's the same reason we always have to say ""allegedly"" when talking about crimes that haven't been prosecuted yet, even if it's obvious who the perpetrator is.

Is it the RIGHT stance? No. I think we should call out racism for what it is, whether it's attacks on Asian Americans or the vile shit the President spews. But just trying to explain the double-speak -- so to speak."

They downplay it because the Chinese community doesn't receive any sympathy from the white community - this is mostly age old resentment that we're not white but generally doing well and we're too different to be relatable; because we're not disadvantaged (well their bias has not disadvantaged us as a community- they also don't get any social justice points for sticking up for us."

0,vyu937,"I can at least speak to the scholarly side of this and say that East Asian Studies and Area Studies are historically orientalist, meaning as academic disciplines they have always been steered by white men and reinforced the otherness of the ""East."" Throughout the Cold War, this became even more specifically anti-communist and we're still living with that legacy now. Most white media and the mainstream political rhetoric in the United States imagines itself as politically neutral or liberal (not in the bipartisan sense but just that there is a foundation of liberalism). But this liberalism is founded on anti-communism and American exceptionalism. Sadly, xenophobia and orientalism are woven into those ideologies on a political, cultural, and economic level."
1,vyu937,"I know white men on both sides of the China policy spectrum, hawks and long arc people. There are just a lot of white men in policy. 

I have a friend who's a hawk who is nonetheless very sympathetic and sensitive to dog whistling and racial targeting when publishing or recommending policy. I know a PhD policy ""dove"" who doesn't speak or read Chinese at all yet claims to understand Chinese politics. Everyone has an opinion, but DC still revolves around white guys."
2,vyu937,"I have a degree in political science and a master's in international relations. I thought about a career in the field and after graduation made some attempts, but as others have touched upon:

* Americans as a whole are pretty racist towards Chinese people, and since my area of focus was East Asia, anything I wrote or published would have been scrutinized for favoritism towards China based on my race, and not on my own reasoned opinions. As such...
* I would have been forced to constantly prove my ""loyalty"" by being super anti-China.
* Ultimately, I did not want to join the State Department or any organization that would help the United States, because why help a country of racists that hate me for being Chinese?

I left that part of my life behind and decided to pursue wealth instead, and got into the Tech industry. I don't regret it one bit."
3,vyu937,"I worked in an adjacent space for awhile and found the most interesting takes I encountered were either from Taiwanese people or white people who had spent 10+ years living in China.

6,vyu937,"Part of it is just from a career point of view, going into IR/think tanks isn't really a field that people get into without some family/educational exposure to, which naturally leads to selection bias toward a demographic and not others. Also, doesn't help when you have to defend yourself from being a spy or wumao shill just for not taking the narrative full stop, or the fact that the FBI has a literal China Initiative which has shown itself to aggressively pursue cases that they know have no substance."
7,vyu937,"Many of the China scholars are no more than racist ideologues, with an approach to China issues no different than what you see on other reddit communities. That approach is basically China is bad, and US nationalism in any of it's forms must oppose China. Yet China is a complicated country, but any attempt to bring that complexity into the discourse will usually result in hostility."
8,vyu937,This is something I've noticed too when reading English coverage of political news in Asia.
9,vyu937,"I’m not surprised that most China scholars are white people because when I took university courses on Chinese history, the professors were all white and the textbooks were all written by white people. 

At least the China scholars can speak, read and write Chinese. A lot of the “China watchers” can’t even do that! Can you imagine proclaiming to be an expert on French geopolitics without being fluent in French?"
10,vyu937,Most Middle East analysts in DC are also white :-))
11,vyu937,"I have a working (unprofessional) theory that this is the reason US China relations are always so tense. If you have a fundamental lack of understanding of how the government and people think and function in this culture, how are you going to effectively target foreign policy? You’re just going to cause constant offence and then scratch your head when things don’t work out how you think it will. 

In some ways, it was the best back when Nixon and Kissinger first “opened” China, and it’s gotten much worse since then, even though China has moved towards a capitalist society. Kissinger (whatever his other faults) is one of the only authorities on China that I’ve found actually understands the culture and how CCP leaders approach governance. Since then, and especially now, all these old white men who are supposedly “China scholars” view China through a western perspective of international relations and political theory. And you can’t do that. The Chinese model of governance developed through the millennia from a very different set of basic principles from the west, and someone who didn’t grow up in the culture will have a very hard time getting their head around it. 

Honestly, you see this in the study of Chinese history too. It’s mostly white men, and honestly I’ve often read books about Chinese history by scholars with impressive credentials that are, essentially, nonsense in the way they’ve analysed historical events and documents in China."
12,vyu937,"Most of the old China hands were either retired, or sidelined. The new generation of people in charge of East Asia policy are mostly hawkish, many of them spent time in either Japan or Taiwan or ex-military.

If you are a decedent from mainland China, you will not be trusted unless you are vocally anti- China.

The end result is that there is a selection bias."

15,vyu937,"It’s cuz IR field is just white imperialism as an academic subject. When I was a fresh grad, I knew a female Chinese that really wanted to go into journalism. Lol let’s just say that evaporated cuz she dared to have a shred of self worth and dignity. Working around sufferers of yellow fever probably didn’t help either. You see, IR and journalism are all sub fields in the US media/entertainment industry, one that is still heavily influenced by racism and exclusion. If you really want to stay in that field, try to just learn how diplomacy is usually conducted and network with people. A subject oriented blog is a good place to start, and maybe even build a think tank when funding is available. Just remember these industries aren’t really open to new ideas, especially in the West where quarterly profits are the main metric and “better dead than red” still sells."
16,vyu937,"Most of the China hawks I know are Taiwanese Americans. America is still (barely) majority white so naturally a lot of the policymakers tend to be older white men, but there’s definitely quite a few grassroots AA, anti-China lobbies across the US.

It’s just a problem of mass. America has haters around the world, and we only have 1/4th China’s population. A nation that massive can’t really exist without pissing a lot of people off. So now a lot of Chinese Americans carry the blame for a nation where they’ve never even lived 

I’m not sure that there is truly a way to claim a Chinese identity _and_ to expect people to see your nuanced opinion as objective. That’s a tough line to walk"
17,vyu937,"All I can say is I feel uncomfortable near most white international relations/East Asian studies scholars. When don't say something explicitly orientalist/racist, there's still something weird about it."
18,vyu937,"I'm fairly sure my fellow Americans would call me a ""panda hugger"" by now for not being hawkish on China, though much of what I teach my Chinese university students is intended to familiarize them w/ the Eurocentric arguments underlying IR theories like Realism that are supposed to be objective and context neutral.  I happen to be a white dude (though also a quarter Korean) and try to be conscious of the stereotypes and potential excesses of identity politics (I don't believe one has to BE Asian or Chinese to ""understand"" China and am constantly told that I don't by nationalists who use ""understanding"" as a substitute for ""agreeing with all of the CCP;s positions"").  Unfortunately, being a white male lends one more credibility throughout academia according to surveys, and that goes doubly so in the PRC.  All that said, I try to incorporate as many female and minority voices into my curriculum as possible.  Good luck to anyone trying to navigate debates w/ nuance."
19,vyu937,"""China scholar"" sounds like a neutral term but it's really not. ""China hawk"" doesn't even sound neutral in the first place.

These people's roles aren't about giving facts or in-depth knowledge. They make appearances and give statementst that provide support to objectives of thinktanks or government administrations. This isn't to say some of the criticism directed towards the PRC government isn't legitimate, but the baseline goal was never about doing what is right and only what is right."
20,vyu937,Do we find it weird that the people critical of China are not Chinese ? No not really bro
21,vyu937,We should be seeing more Hong Kong scholars who fled HK joining the ranks of “China hawks” soon.
22,vyu937,"No because academia and IR is very white originated and white influenced. Plus in America, white Americans are still the most populous group. I also don’t have any data on this but I also imagine IR, politics, economics, and any similar field is more likely to exist and be enrolled in in more elite colleges which tend to skew more white.

So while there is a weirdness to it, I also imagine it’s influenced by demographics of those getting in the field and there simply aren’t enough Chinese American scholars in this field. Plus I personally think it’s good if there is diverse interest in such fields; while it’s not good if one group that has no innate cultural relations is dominating the field, I think one should be cautious about discouraging individuals from studying such fields simply because they are not of a matching cultural group and are in the dominant group.

Having said that, I am sure it’s worth looking into and investigating more to see if there are particular biases in hiring. Maybe people already have."
23,vyu937,Wait until you see what the media and influencers in China says about US.
24,vyu937,"I teach ESL to Chinese immigrants in California. I have become very cautious when discussing China with my students. I understand it is their homeland and they are proud of it’s many accomplishments and it’s culture. Sometimes, however, I find myself debating students when I should be neutral as I am an English teacher not a politics professor. It is very difficult to listen to some students praise Mao Tse Tung and deny Tiennamen Square ever occured(or that the slaughter was justified). There are students that know nothing about the cultural revolution or  the detainment of Huigyrs. When I try to inform them of these historic events, they tell me that American propaganda lies to me. Mind you, this is only a small percentage of students. When they deny what I consider common knowledge, I sometimes wonder, maybe I am being tricked by bias American media. This is when I talk to the other students asking if I am crazy and they always tell me I am correct as of some Chinese are just nationalistic bootlickers or too invested in the propaganda to admit the truth. That is the most dangerous and nauseating element of the Chinese government. Their strategy of denying reality goes against everything I believe in. It causes people outside of China to distrust the country and  not take any of their positive aspects seriously because they lie so much it is dangerous to even believe their truths.

edit: I sure did get criticized, downvoted, mocked and discouraged for my honest response. None of the replies say anything relevant. Why am I being downvoted and criticized? I am curious."

**Video transcription**:

>I really hate what \[TikTok\] has done to the term Asianfishing because literally everyone has missed the point. **The point of addressing Asianfishing was always to address the way the Asian identity is fetishized and commodified.** The goal was always to have non-Asians ask themselves ""how do I contribute to the commodification of Asian culture?"" But nobody is asking themselves that question.  
>  
>The fact that you have Asian creators on this app talking about Asianfishing and the primary response isn't ""well, how do I understand the history and the impact of this more?"" but rather ""can you tell me if this is Asianfishing? Is this eyeliner style okay? What if I already have almond eyes? Is it okay then?"" shows that you have completely missed the point.  
>  
>The fact that you have Asian creators showcasing their culture on \[TikTok\] and the primary response isn't ""oh, I want to understand this more! what culture is this from, what's the history?"" but ""oh, this is really pretty. I want to wear this too! Is that okay or is that racist?"" shows that you have completely missed the point.  
>  
>And I can appreciate the good intentions, I can, but even if you recognize that Asianfishing is wrong and you don't do it yourself, **you're still valuing Asian culture more as a product to be consumed than as an actual vulnerable human history.** The underlying problem is still there and everyone's ignoring it.

**Some comments**:

1,neuj1d,"I agree. Seems like so many white kids these days want to co-opt the aesthetics and culture of POC while being able to live without the oppression that comes with being a minority. I find it weird that so many white people get tattoos of Chinese characters/mythology or drool over sleek qipaos/hairpins but then turn around and tell Chinese people that their country's culture is evil/nonexistent because of communism, blah blah blah.

And yeah, don't spam Asian people online and ask them if this and that is racist or if this is appropriation. Like if you already have the pre-existing notion that it might be problematic enough that you have to ask, don't do it in the first place. For example I think the traditional Naths Indian women wear at weddings look so cool but I'm not going to walk around with one because I have a brain and know it's not culturally appropriate.

Or if you use your own judgement and you feel it isn't problematic, then honestly just do it and be open to listening if someone tells you it's appropriation. I've seen non-Asian people casually wear modernized qipao/kimonos once or twice as a fit and no one was upset by it because they were respectful about it and didn't make it their aesthetic. Like use your damn brains and stop trying to get the ""not racist"" card omfg."
2,neuj1d,"Such a good video thank you for sharing! Especially her point that these questions are framed to center the product and commodification of asian culture. To add to that, it also centers the offender instead of the offended. It’s like stopping short of apologizing to someone, and instead of saying “can you help me understand how that hurt you?”… these people are saying “well can I do this instead?” And therefore, not apologizing or reflecting at all, just wanting permission to still “safely” do what they want. 

If anyone has read Minor Feelings (recommend so much!) it reminds me of a passage explaining how white people who push back against racial equality, are mistakenly equating being finally conscious of their race to experiencing racism… when rather they just need to be conscious of their place in a system of white hegemony."

5,t3coa6,"OP,


Unlike you I don't remember much during the early 2000's and rarely understood how public approval for the wars could have been at an all time high with traces of cancel culture taking place for groups like the Dixie Girls as well. I always assumed that people over-reacted and didn't have access to verify news articles and such.



Initially I liked how reddit reacted to Russian threats and the invasion, but in the past few days people over here have gone completely off the scales.


I saw the boat refueling post as well and was surprised to see reddit cheer against Russians who're not connected to their government in any way. Adding to that you also have people who believe it's okay to hurt the average Russian citizen because that'll force them to revolt against Putin - that's just plain madness











Today I saw the post about Indian & Nigerian students facing complications at the border and was shocked to see how quickly people labelled it 'propaganda', responded with 'whataboutisms' and believed it was justified because India abstained from a UN vote







All this has taught me that the average person on reddit has an unhealthy amount of hate & hypocrisy and also making me worried about future geopolitical implications as a WOC."
6,t3coa6,"Also, have you even seen how they've been talking shit about China/Chinese even though it's Russia currently invading Ukraine?  It is terrifying enough without going to war with China.

I am still seeing a lot of ""fuck Putin"" and ""fuck the Russian government"" but you can bet your ass that if China or India was in Russia's place it would suddenly become ""Fuck Chinese people"" and ""Fuck Indian people""

Russia isn't getting it as bad because they are still white plain and simple. ""Russian people are fine we hate the government!"" but if it was China or India, there would be a lot of ""these people are savages"". You know it would be true. And  India would have it worse than China I'd assume, probably cause darker skinned (srs). Pathetic."

12,t3coa6,"LOL @ all the naive comments in here thinking OP is overreacting.

Did we all suddenly forget that violence & hate crimes against Asians increased dramatically due to COVID?

Now imagine that with China being targeted as an active enemy with constant propaganda fired through all channels of media. It is already happening now, but if it is the scale of the Russian-Ukrainian response, then Asians will absolutely not be safe."
13,t3coa6,"That's one thing I noticed, regarding treatment of Russians in the US vs. Asians in general. Russia has outright attacked the US by hacking into US agencies and disrupting the supply of fuel and consumer goods like beef. Russia has also hacked into the US power grid. And now, Russia is messing with the global economy during an inflationary period.  

But you don't see random Russians being attacked on the street. You don't see people randomly cussing out Russians and telling them to go back to their country. Yet if you look  East Asian, you'll be hassled because China has been deemed an enemy. Mass media isn't helping much either. 

*""You brought Covid to the US, you ch\*\*k!""*

Yeah, it's already bad enough as it is right now. And it could definitely become much worse. A lot of these incidents happen in places with a heavy, East Asian presence like SF and NY, so don't assume you'll be safe because of numbers."
14,t3coa6,"\>God help you if the US goes to war with China and your family is of mainland background

I'd say anybody with an Asian face is going to get the short end of the stick because racists won't distinguish between Asians. So it wouldn't just be limited to people who are Chinese decent.

Let's just hope that US vs China conflict remains an unlikely event...but who knows. We've been dealing with a lot of weird shit in the 2020s.

The average racist is dumb as rocks, quick to treat anybody without a white face as a criminal simply for existing, and violent. A terrible combination that nobody wants to deal with.

Idk if Russians civilians are really getting hate from the world, though, considering they are protesting. I have seen many give sympathy towards them for being dragged into war. I'm sure people are directing some hate towards the military, though, which kind of makes sense but even then I've also seen some people sympathize with soldiers who seem young."
15,t3coa6,"We hate the government not the people is and has always been nonsense. Its not done out of genuine desire to separate people from their governments, but for mental comfort of those who wish to engage in violence and hatred. If a Russian family in America were kill by Neo-Nazis in America right now it would get no coverage, one paragraph buried on the sidebar would all it would get. 

And Russians are mostly White."
16,t3coa6,I don’t think a true hot war between the US and China is likely. At worst it’ll be a proxy war. No way in hell is the US going to invade Chinese soil or vice versa because those kinds of wars are not winnable and I think both sides know that. Nations don’t have feelings or honor or any other human emotion that nationalists on both sides project. What good is national honor to the families of the dead?
17,t3coa6,"one good thing about this russian/ukraine conflict is that all the major global powers are realizing how taxing war has become in this day and age --- not just militarily, politically, or economically, but instead you've to deal with the shit storm on the internet, especially the social media front, so it'll be hard to gather any military morale when your soldiers are reading fake news on reddit all day confused as to what's really going on...  

so rest assure, doubt we'll be seeing WW3 in our life time"
18,t3coa6,That's weird I haven't seen any hate directed towards Russian civilians only the Russian Government and Putin himself. Even when people post videos of dead Russian soldiers I still see constant comments on how this is sad no matter who dies. Because most of the soldiers fighting are kids barely into their 20s and most don't even want to fight.
19,t3coa6,If you’re Chinese passing (EA or SEA) please remember Asian solidarity and don’t be one of those who throw other Asian Americans under the bus.
20,t3coa6,"Am European and not American so my experience could be different.  


But no the people here are supportive of the brave Russians who go out to protest and call for them to remove Putin from power.   
The hate is solely reserved for Putin, the government, Belarusian government & the militaries.   
That being said, even some sympathy is spared for the Russians that die since people think that it's just young boys"

23,t3coa6,"No. Maybe I just have a very strong filter bubble, but the only time I've seen people on social media targeting Russians living in the U.S. is when they're getting dogpiled for suggesting it. E.g. when Representative Swalwell suggested expelling Russian students, the response I saw was mostly strong condemnation."
24,t3coa6,"Yeah I'm wary of that too. Support for Ukraine is awesome, and Russia/Putin is the clear aggressor/bad guy here. But Im watching out for racist idiots who think they're ""doing their part"" harassing regular Russian folks/Russian Americans."
25,t3coa6,"yo, not doubting you or anything, but do you have a source/an article about the ship / if it was a civilian ship"
26,t3coa6,"Yes. The west, especially Americans, are eating every single second of it up. Media critique is at an all-time low. Wasn't this the same media that lied about US wars, police brutality, and school shooters?

&#x200B;

Also 100% what you said. War with China was close to inevitable even without recent events. We saw the world's response to COVID regarding their opinions on asians. It will definitely be amplified if that war breaks out."
27,t3coa6,"Yes, because half of my family is Chinese, the other half is Taiwanese, and I’m seeing a lot of “progressive” people grasping at straws to justify the invasion not as a geopolitical move, but as a righteous race war. “Hating the government is raaaacist” means basically nothing when neither pro/anti-American people are capable of extending human courtesy to both sides of a conflict. What does caring about Sinophobia mean when the people who say that would call me a 汉奸 and call for the destruction of a good chunk of my family at the drop of a hat? What does caring about racism in the abstract mean when they see all diasporas as gusanos that need to be shot? 

Seeing everyone here immediately assume that we’re all supposed to sympathize with Russia as Asians is quite scary ngl, if anything you’re drinking the “East vs. West” Kool Aid harder than any racist bluecheck out there."
28,t3coa6,"Yep, it would be even worse for Asian americans since we can't blend in like Russian Americans can. I pray we never go to war with China since it would be bad for all."
29,t3coa6,Yes very scary. The news would really twist regular people’s mind. Just hope this won’t happen to us one day :(
30,t3coa6,">The comments in that video of the Georgian sailors refusing fuel and repairs to an Russian (civilian) ship

Refusing to give the Russian ship fuel makes more sense once you remember Russia invaded Georgia before. During that invasion the world watched helpless unable to provide help. Able bodied Georgians are lining up mow to join the fight in Ukraine because of that invasion. Preventing supplies and weapons from getting to Russia would be a smart thing if you didn't want it used against you or your allies, tell me do you know whats on that ship.


>Look at the articles on Indian and African students trying to flee the war and cross the border right now then look at the down votes

Ask yourself why the ""injustices' you are talking about are only being reported by unknown news sources and cant be verified through legitimate media. You are being down voted because you failed to check your sources and you're falling for the misinformation campaign.

You are either deliberately spreading misinformation now or just gullible and unable to sort credible news sources from those made simply for spreading disinformation.

Edit: BTW if any country invades another country without provocation they should expect the same treatment. Telling someone to fuck off is much better than killing them. You will survive fucking off."
31,t3coa6,"idk I’m gonna be honest…I think you’re kinda being extra with this. 

Also, was it confirmed that it was an actual civilian ship? It’s war time op and it’s pretty easy to lie that it was a civilian ship like how easy it was for those Russian soldiers to wear Ukraine uniforms to cause damage"
32,t3coa6,"90 % of the media coverage on Ukraine is propaganda lmfao.  All the coverage about the Ghost of Kyiv, the 13 soldiers who said fuck you and the “recovered Russian conscript’s letters to mama” are manufactured bullshit.  It’s so cringe and stupid.  Read between the lines and you will see zero honest coverage about the geopolitics of the situation and everything is aimed to get an emotional reaction out of us viewers.  Pathetic"
33,t3coa6,[removed]
34,t3coa6,"I remember reading elsewhere about someone in the States who played with friends from Russia, and how they were nervous around before the invasion about what was happening with their government. And a lot of Russian people, troops and civilians, seem to be strongly against what is happening, especially with more stories about soldiers not knowing what they're getting into. I can understand the support for Ukraine and condemnation of the Russian government, but it's setting a bad precedent if we extend our hatred of the government towards all the Russian people just because they happen to be from the same country."
35,t3coa6,"What gets me is the massive amount of astroturfing on social media by actors trying to exploit inequalities in Western countries as a way to shift the conversation away from Russia literally violating nuclear non-proliferation and invading a sovereign country for the crime of aligning with the EU.

Just one example, during the 1984 olympics, KGB officers from Moscow pretended to be the KKK and distributed racist anti-black and anti-Asian threats to athletes to discourage them:

[https://www.si.com/olympics/2020/07/28/the-cold-war-the-klan-and-the-olympics](https://www.si.com/olympics/2020/07/28/the-cold-war-the-klan-and-the-olympics)"
36,t3coa6,"Yeah it's definitely concerning.  Reactionary mobs are gonna be reactionary mobs, but this is a good time to be looking VERY closely at what certain politicians and people with influence are saying and calling them out.

Like, Eric Swalwell is a known idiot from the 2020 primaries, but holy shit he should never be allowed to get any more political power after his dumbass statements trying to ban every single foreign Russian student from the US."
37,t3coa6,[deleted]
38,t3coa6,"Seriously? Mob bloodlust? Don't you think you're over exaggerating, or was the sky falling as well in 2003? I don't think many would even describe those that attacked the US Capitol last January as a bloodlust mob.

All the evidence you cite is  only anecdotal. We all are biased when it comes to remembering only the ""bad"" things and or putting more weight on them than is actually justified. Look at others that cite the Canadian governments actions against the protesting truckers as evidence of democratic governments becoming totalitarian institutions, or even those that protested in America last year against stay at home orders.  

If social media comments scare the bejesus out of you I am envious. What really scares me are things like North Korea's recent ballistic missile tests, Russian nuclear forces being put on high alert, and Chinese tests of hypersonic cruise missiles with nuclear capabilities. 

I also really don't know what to think about your comment about war with China, other than I find it far fetched. Even with Russia invading Ukraine, the idea of the US and Russia engaging in open military conflict is still very unlikely, which puts the idea of war with China in the near future at best a very remote possibility. This is further supported by the fact that in recent months Japanese officials have begun to signal that it would interpret a Chinese invasion of Taiwan as a direct attack against Japan and that Japan and Australia have signed a joint defense treaty. And while the Chinese navy is technically the largest, its capabilities at best only match that of current US naval forces in the Pacific, and lacks the necessary amount of amphibious assault ships and landing craft to mount an invasion."

2,560z3j,"So this dude (Watters) came to my super-ultra-liberal alma mater a year or two ago to talk to students about white males and oppression, the video ended up being one of the cringiest things I've ever seen. His whole shtick is basically being an A+ troll - think of the most inflammatory, shamelessly douchey assholes you've come across on reddit, that's basically him but in real life.

So I can't say I'm surprised. By the video, by his ""apology,"" by any of this. I want to say don't feed the trolls and stop giving him attention, except for whatever ridiculous reasons this troll is employed by mainstream media (albeit Fox, so...)."
3,560z3j,"Conservatives: Why don't Asians vote Republican? They're hard-working and have strong family values.

6,560z3j,"What I'm pissed about is that, they would never dare go to the ghettos and make fun of ""thug/gangsta blacks' shooting up stuff, go to a Latino neighborhood and make fun of ""illegal Mexicans, with lawnmower/ manual labor jokes"", muslim neighborhoods with suicide bombing jokes, German and Nazi jokes, Jews and the holocaust. So why is it only okay to be racist to only Asians on live TV? .I mean really, pearl harbor, internment, nuclear bombs, spying, shitty accent jokes, shitty jokes about domesticated animals, political purgers and human trafficking and sex slavery? C'mon man. If only I can punch these idiotic fuckfaces."
7,560z3j,"Dear Fox News,
To distill my culture and history into a joke is no laughing matter to me or the millions of Asian-Americans across the country. But that's exactly what you let happen.

As an Asian-American, I'm offended and an an American I'm baffled that you allowed this to air. 

I've dealt with racism all my life. I'm always striving to show that I belong. But then to be openly mocked shows me what you think of the largest growing minority in America. And it must not be very much. My parents raised me thinking that I will have a seat at the table and now it's apparent that you believe that my seat is should be nonexistent or I am a gag for your amusement. 

As a journalist, I hoped this segment could an insightful look into what Asian voters want but this is not even a report. Supposedly, it's a supposed to be funny but is there one creative joke in the entire 5 minute clip? We've heard it all before and it's no longer funny. Plus you mixed up your stereotypes.  Instead of showing a beautiful and vibrant and wonderful culture, you're perpetuated stereotypes. As a major news network, you should be ashamed. I know that segment had to go through several levels of management and no one said, ""hey that's too far"", that's disgusting. 

I've debated wether or not posting this. Maybe thinking that I'm being too sensitive or I'm not getting the joke. But I can't help it. If these are the jokes we allow on television, then what are we saying at home? Instead of sharing cultures, you are openly mocking mine. 

Anyone who finds the segment funny and not offensive doesn't realize the pain or strife many Asian Americans have gone through to come here and build a better life. There are countless stories of immigrants coming here with nothing and working hard. My grandfather was one of them. Now you're spitting in their faces and their struggles to be accepted. 

To people on Facebook who don't understand why I am offended or say I should get a sense of humor, then understand you have no empathy. Jokes like these need to be left in the past not in our future. "
8,560z3j,[removed]
9,560z3j,Conservatives can't do comedy or satire. They just aren't capable of processing why this is offensive. They see Daily Show segments and Jimmy Kimmel and don't understand why it's offensive when they *try* to do the same thing. They're the white guy who thinks it's okay to use the N-word because Dave Chapelle used it. 
10,560z3j,"Fox News thinks Chinese-American voters don't know what's going on?  We're dissing your fascist cheeto avatar by 40 points, so I'd say we're more aware of what's up than you'll ever be."
11,560z3j,"What's the point? Fox would give a superficial apology, and soon return to saying blasé racist jokes for their own entertainment."
12,560z3j,It looks really edited together too so people are set up for failure no matte rwhat
13,560z3j,"Demanding an apology is probably one of the worst responses to something like this. It's never gonna happen, at least not with sincerity, and is like candy to them, giving the appearance that they actually hurt us in some way, and only elicits mocking and/or condescension from them. Better to mercilessly call them out and ridicule them over this variety of shit.

Edit - Yes? The objection is...? Don't be shy; step up to the plate and own your downvote. "
14,560z3j,"Seriously... Is this 2016? I swear Trump opened a whole new door where it's okay to air racist stupid shit like this on air. 

On the other hand, what can we do as Asian Americans to make some noise about this? We can vent about our feelings on social media, but I'm not sure if that would make a difference. "

19,560z3j,"> This is the psycho-social climate of intimidation with which the Trump campaign has bedevilled the country. That a buffoon with deplorable manners can endlessly exercise his right to self-satisfied idiocy is a scary thing. Scarier still are the tiny seeds of self-doubt he sows in each one of us who has ever been led to believe that those who insult us might somehow be better than us, that we should be the ones who are embarrassed. That such a man could, one day soon, be the leader of a nation built by immigrants—now, that’s a new kind of fear, and of shame.

3,pgfw0v,"Not excited about Shang-Chi. Granted, I respect all of the actors, but to me, this movies only reinforces old perceptions about Asians, in that the only way that they can be seen as physically capable are as martial artists.

3,clm87g,oh please...
4,clm87g,"Nah, speak for yourself and don't assume every bad thing you experienced is due to asianess. I was put in extra classes to get help with homework, and that is when money was tight on the family. Though I was annoying at the time, i'm grateful for it now."
5,clm87g,"Can’t relate, because it’s not an “Asian thing” y’all just had shit parents don’t drag mine into this because you want to perpetuate stereotypes that American media has ingrained into you."
6,clm87g,Yeah.. not an asian thing. My parents helped and still help whenever asked whether it’s something big or small. Just bad parenting like everyone else says.
7,clm87g,"What a lame ""Asian"" stereotype."
8,clm87g,"Damn did this really happen to a lot of people? I never asked my parents for help because they couldn’t read English, not because they would beat me. So sad."
9,clm87g,How did this get so highly upvoted when 90% of the comments (and their upvotes) are criticizing it?
10,clm87g,"I know it may not have occured to you, but people who immigrate tend to do so out of socioeconomic reasons and because they didn't have the money or status to defend their livelihood in hard times.  A lot of immigrant parents aren't abusive because they're Asian, but because they're essentially uneducated hicks. I can tell you the upbringing for poor whites in many parts of the us absolutely has a higher rate of abuse just because the parents grow up in harsh situations and lack education.   One of my best friends is poor white  with such parents and I can tell you their family was very much like that.

 Very very few, and absolutely none, in my case, of educated Asians that come from several generations of being in an educated social classes, that immigrate to do things like Masters and phds, even beat their kids, much less abuse their kids.  Growing up, I got spanked when I was very young if I screwed up, then it became a slap on the hand.  Then nothing physical after mid middle school.  

The stereotype for abusive Asian parents is absolutely over exaggerated, lacks perspective, and has so much more to do with poverty or a lack of education than anything inherently ""Asian""."
11,clm87g,My parents would have gotten mad for NOT asking for help.
12,clm87g,That is kind of why I don't ask questions to my mom. It goes from a simple question to yell fest.
13,clm87g,"Abusive parenting and Asian parenting aren't the same thing but that's not what this tweet is saying, anyway? She seems to be wanting to make those Asians who *did* experience this feel safe in speaking up rather than implying it's an Asian problem."
14,clm87g,I always asked my friends. My parents are dumb af lmao.
15,clm87g,"Is it just me or does this seems to be an Asian-***American*** specific experience?

I'm Chinese-Canadian and I never heard of this phenomenon of Asian parents beating their kids for failing to get an A+. I've never heard of this happening in my community when growing up.

Are there any Asian-Canadians here that can relate to the tweet posted by the OP? Similarly, are there any Asian-Australians that can relate to this as well?

My guess as to why this would be a more frequent phenomenon in the United States is that American society is IMO essentially more Darwinian & class-based compared to other countries in the Anglosphere. Hence there is greater pressure to succeed academically because if you don't get into a top ranked private school like Harvard then you won't have the social status to get a high-paying job, afford private health insurance plan, live in a nice neighborhood, etc.

Whereas in Canada, all universities are publicly funded so **where you went to school** isn't really as important as **what you studied**. It's baffling to me that a Harvard graduate who majored in English literature has a greater chance of getting a job at a Wall Street investment bank than an accounting major at a state university."
16,clm87g,"I’m gonna get downvoted for this, but I feel for you OP. From my knowledge, abuse is absolutely downplayed and not taken as seriously as it should be in the Asian American community. Yes, it is a thing in all cultures, but there is a reason so many Asians here in the US can relate to some sort of childhood abuse. It is normalized, and it shouldn’t be."

2,w3me36,Sadly normalized and internalized by Western culture and media
3,w3me36,I take it you haven’t seen what the biggest Asian subreddits are?
4,w3me36,This post reminds me of the [murder of Yingying Zhang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Yingying_Zhang) and [the murder of Yangjie Li](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Yangjie_Li). The white guy who kidnapped and murdered Zhang apparently got his ideas from Fetlife. And the white couple that kidnapped and murdered Li was also into BDSM.
5,w3me36,The kink space is white male dominated.  And you don't get the most savory types of people there as well.
6,w3me36,It’s the legacy and persistence of white men hypersexualizing Asian women. I feel like fetishization like this is just the modern extension of stuff like China Doll or Dragon Lady.
7,w3me36,"OP, do yourself a favour and don't search reddit for anything Asian"
8,w3me36,"Race fetishes are inherently problematic, so I definitely would stay away from anyone who appears to fetishize Asian people or let alone anyone based on race."
9,w3me36,"I'm sex positive but it's obvious that some kinks are just a front for people to live out their weird prejudices and abusive behavior under the guise of kinks. It's also predominantly white. 

Raceplay is inherently racist. Age play is pedophilia. Most misogyny play is some idiotic guy taking out his hatred of women under the guise of play.

It doesn't matter if your community is woke and inclusive, if it's filled with white people, they think less of you because of your race and no amount of mental gymnastics fixes that. 

Most of them won't ever admit it because they're the passive aggressive types but they will break you down with their microaggressions and not even feel an ounce of compassion for you while virtue signaling about woke issues. 

To all Asians and POCs, don't participate in these communities. They're filled with weird predators. It's all always obvious initially but once you see it you'll wish you were vanilla."

Actually, nevermind
I'm gonna kinkshame. It's appalling where it comes from."
18,w3me36,"Omg I’m always trying to explain this to people. Asian women have been objectified and over sexualized and stereotyped by western society to a disgusting point. I mean, all women have, but Asian women in particular seem to be viewed as especially submissive and fetishized heavily. Even men who would otherwise not consider dating or having sexual contact with a woman outside of their own race or ethnicity seem to make an exception for Asian women. It especially disturbs me when they’re really into the anime school girl aesthetic and prefer very young looking and small Asian women. 

I am a sex worker- I’m a cam girl and I can attest that a lot of men come to my room because my race is marked as Asian (I’m mixed but definitely look Japanese). And every single time someone says that’s why they came to my room they want a shy, submissive, obedient, innocent asian girl to giggle and blush. It’s a whole thing. I guess it adds to my income but I hold these kinds of customers in especially low regard. Like, have they ever met an asian woman? Most that I know, whether born in the US or abroad, are driven, outspoken, strong women who, more often than not, run their household with discipline and demand respect from their family members."
19,w3me36,"I'm guessing that alot of white men like assume that Asian women are submissive. I hate that stereotype, I will always wonder if a White guy is with me because of that. 

This Asian woman is not submissive at all lol"

21,w3me36,I have friends who are in the kink community where I live and I have attended munches that they organize and host and parties. Believe me that is just the tip of the iceberg. I have mentioned it before here on this sub I have noticed Asian women in the kink community / fetlife (and to some extent other WOC but it’s not nearly as prevalent) seem to gravitate towards white people as play partners and proudly advertise that that’s what they are looking for (only white dom or sub etc etc). Fortunately I have met a small select few who acknowledge this weird phenomenon and choose to only want to play with and take photos with POCs to help diversify things.
22,w3me36,"I think ""duh, what do you expect? That's just society's view"""
23,w3me36,The history of American white cultural identity is 90% racism. You take the racism (therefore their cultural identity) away and suddenly white school shooters are everywhere.
24,w3me36,"Lol I'd bet money that sub has 11,988 white men and 12 Asians, of whom 9 are also men. 🤣"
25,w3me36,"Yup, any sort of sexual space online where you put in ""Asian"" is going to have that dynamic in some shape or form."
26,w3me36,Look up Asian porn. It’s pretty clear what role Asians are expected to occupy in American gender and sexual politics
27,w3me36,"I’m an Asian femme, and have been involved in the kink community for 8 years. A lot of it is very white and fetishizes the hell out of Asian women, but I’ve found a lot more diversity and anti-racism in queer kink spaces. I’m fortunate to live in the NYC metro area, where there is a smaller queer asian kink community that doesn’t tolerate this kind of racism. This isn’t easy to find everywhere though. 

A lot of kink/BDSM can be closely intertwined with and encourage Asian fetishism, but there are parts of the community that have done a really good job of making me feel comfortable, seen, and included, much more so than I feel in public or on a day-to-day basis. 

Asian people are entitled to a sense of safety and inclusion in these spaces, and we shouldn’t have to turn down self-exploration in kink if that doesn’t exist. If you’re interested in exploring, I hope you’re able to! We need more Asian visibility in the kink/BDSM community so we can keep fighting against this kind of bullshit."
28,w3me36,"As an Asian person who has been active in my local kink community for the past five years, and who has made a lot of friends there, my beliefs are that:

1) Yep, there's some pretty distasteful stereotyping of Asian women and men in western media and western society (Asian women hyper-sexualized, Asian men de-sexualized), which we also see extended into the kink community.

2) I accept that people have their preferences; I think it's distasteful that there's so many white people with yellow fever, and that there's so many Asians who seek out white partners, but we've all got a right to pursue our own happiness.  

3) But personally, I don't care to become friends with people like this.  If I see people in the ""Asian submissive for white dominants"" group (or if they have a myriad of other red flags such as being super-thirsty), then we're not going to be friends.  I'll be cordial if I see them at munches or events, but I don't invite them to my events, or try to befriend them.

Ultimately kinky people are just like regular people, except that that they're open about liking sex, or are sex nerds.  And just like how in the real world there's a whole lot of racists and idiots, this also holds true in the kink community.  Being a kinkster doesn't make you a better human being."
29,w3me36,"To each their own, but I hate how all my gay asian friends are usually submissive, only adding to that stereotype."
30,w3me36,"I wonder if it's sorta like the Ashley Madison ""dating"" app, but it only consists of white people."
31,w3me36,"I'm kind of curious about what the ratio of white to Asian is, and what the ratio of genders are. Is it mostly white guys who joined the group trying to hook up with Asian girls (which, I'm assuming is the case)? Are there Asian guys and white girls? LGBTQ+? Or do they only allow membership from ""confirmed"" couples? Is there a reverse group of Asian dominants and white submissives, and how much smaller is it?

No doubt there is fetishization involved, but the website is literally called ""Fetlife."" I think people do and should be allowed to have their preferences for the most part (as long as they don't make it weird and it's not, you know, illegal). Ideally, people who are in this type of relationship SHOULD respect one another's boundaries and respect each other as human beings at the end of the day. In reality, as with any online relationship finding experience, there's probably more creeps than would be worth dealing with."
32,w3me36,"It is very normal for people to take things that are violent and disempowering in real life and use fantasy role play to gain pleasure and (perhaps counterintuitively) a sense of empowerment and mastery in relation to the issue. There is a reason many women are into ""consensual nonconsent"" and rape role-play, we are bombarded with threats of sexual violence constantly and it makes perfect sense that people's erotic imaginations are impacted. It doesn't mean those women actually want to get raped, they just find it hot to act it out. Same w/ racial dynamics. I don't think that having some fantasies means the people actually believe in the racial hierarchy irl. 

I would say, as with any fetish, if you don't like it, don't do it. And just be careful and aware that shitty and abusive people use fetish/kink spaces to find victims (just like other spaces like work, church, etc)."
33,w3me36,"I'm in a kink community that is more progressive and queer friendly

I don't see a lot of other Asian people (of any gender). Outright racism is definitely unacceptable. I don't think anyone would do race play out in the open

There are some microagressions. Less educated folks who think my ethnicity is a good topic for small talk come up from time to time. About as often as in society at large"
34,w3me36,"(i'm writing from a place of profound hurt and harm, not just from this topic, but social-psychological-financial-politically.)

what makes ppl believe bdsm is not the product of a very sick society long gone awry, i have no idea.

OP just discovered this, now? this evidence of post-colonial white worship among westernised asians? how is this not a logical outcome of feudalist-empirialist capitalist post colonial brainwashing? 

the already twisted lies of 'consensual power exchange' propaganda in a 'safe, sane' environment are patently what they are, lies. BDSM folk arent sane. the politics is real. the abuse is real.

wake up."
35,w3me36,"In and of itself, there's nothing inherently wrong with race-play, or dom/sub play if that is your thing and everything is consensual and mutually enjoyable. Just like there's nothing inherently wrong about a white man dating an Asian woman. But just like you have to carefully vet a white guy dating an Asian woman to ensure no racist/dehumanizing tendencies, you have to do the same thing here. 

Any time there is any festishizable aspect, you have to control for that to ensure the person you are seeking to partner with views you as a person first, who likes you for you, to avoid just being a sex object.

I am sure there are some dudes in that sub-group who are fine. But I am also sure that the overwhelming majority have racist views about submissive Asian females and are not going to be the best partners. If I was a woman interested in that sort of thing, I'd probably avoid that group. I'd try to find a partner first, from bumble, or wherever, then introduce them to race-play or dom-sub play once I knew there was mutual-respect."
36,w3me36,hopefullly you like the person/persons your because you on the same wavelength and not skin color good luck
37,w3me36,"Its a kink and should be viewed as such. I would be cautious of jumping to conclusions about individuals in that group just because they are there. If both sides are consenting it's not a problem. Someones kinks are not necessarily indicative of how they view or function in society. In *all* fetishes, just like in ""vanilla"" dating, theres a mixed bag of reasons for people to have their preferences, and its up to each to sort out good matches from bad. You have to look at the whole person, just like someone who has a fetish is also capable of looking at the whole person. Also, not everyone in that group would necessarily have that as a fetish. There will be a lot of people just exploring.

Yeh bring the downvotes. Im an assertive asian female who has submissive kinks and i dont judge guys of whatever ethnicity who happen to like me by their kink alone. Im not defined by my fetishes and they aren't by theirs."
38,w3me36,"well i am sure if you look you find a dominant groups whether you dom or sub knowing about the your with is more important that anything else...also ""sit back and read the room"" and take in information as it comes and if you feel the need to say something do it"

0,pz90mf,Not a restaurant kid.. It's not all in good fun. Saying all Chinese restaurants cut corners is flat out racist.
1,pz90mf,People who say this shit have never worked in a restaurant. I've worked at fancy restaurants and they cut corners and were disgusting.
2,pz90mf,">I understand it’s all supposed to be taken in good fun.

Is it? That doesn't sound at all like it's meant to be lighthearted or humorous. It just sounds like plain old racism. There's no evidence that ""ethnic"" restaurants give you food poisoning at higher rates, all restaurants are subject to the same inspection standards. (How many times have we all eaten at Chinese, Korean, Indian, etc places?) People who say this shit aren't interested in changing what they want to believe.

Side note: I wonder how much greasy chemical-filled fast food this guy consumes."
3,pz90mf,Reddit and racism against Asians go hand and hand
4,pz90mf,They eat McDonald’s and Taco Bell without blinking an eye. Those two chains _invented_ and _perfected_ a **global cabal** of cutting corners.
5,pz90mf,"This is also part of a bigger problem that non-Japanese Asian food tends to suffer from: a perceived cheapness to the cuisine, that prevents restaurants from being able to follow the same pricing principles that an Italian or French restaurant could.

The sheer amount of skilled labor, and number of ingredients, necessary to produce certain Asian dishes results in a huge mismatch between price and labor cost. So some restaurants are forced to cut costs elsewhere: cheaper decor, cheaper utensils, less labor spent on service, less desirable locations, etc. And some of the stuff appears dingy or dirty when it gets old.

Perhaps the biggest place where Asian restaurants cut costs is on management labor. Instead of paying skilled and experienced restaurant managers, a lot of these businesses are owner-operated, where the owner simply cannot afford *not* to work 10 hours a day, 6 days a week. The reason why Asian restaurants are so often closed some random day of the week (Mondays, Tuesdays), is because they've never gotten to the point where they can have managers come and go. Then those owner-managers put their kids to work.

This is a direct result of the idea that Chinese/Thai/Vietnamese/Indian/Pakistani/Korean food should be cheap, that a 10-ingredient dish with $4 of ingredient cost and $5 of labor cost should only cost the customer $11 or $12, with some piddling amount of operational profit to cover the cost of rent, utilities, other expenses, and the owner's profits. Contrast that to a deli selling sandwiches and soups with like half the ingredient cost and half the labor cost, at the same price points.

It's not just Asian cuisine that suffers from this problem. Latin American and other ethnic cuisines have the same thing going on. But it turns into a self-fulfilling prophecy, where perceived cheapness lowers the market category/tier, which feeds back into perception of cheapness."
6,pz90mf,"Not a restaurant kid (restaurant grandkid I guess? hah), but this is definitely a thing... It's a less in-your-face form of racism where people sometimes automatically assume that Chinese (or Mexican) food is dirty or unsanitary. David Chang's Ugly Delicious docuseries actually addresses this in some of his episodes! Would highly recommend."
7,pz90mf,"Reddit in general outside of this sub and few others isn’t  very Chinese  friendly at all. There is nothing funny about it just like this girl I knew  told her friend to watch out for covid when he ordered food from a Chinese restaurant. I did feel offended , I am chinese American/ Canadian."
8,pz90mf,"I'm not a restaurant kid, but that is just racism showing through. It's not a joke. People legitimately think that ""ethnic"" food establishments are dirty. That makes no sense, when all food establishments have to have their health rating on the window. They're all clean."
9,pz90mf,There is nothing there to be taken in good fun.
10,pz90mf,"I was once selling cat food on Facebook and mentioned that my cats didn’t like it. Some white Karen decided to comment and tell me that I should take my cats to a nearby Chinese restaurant and then they’ll eat the cat food, implying either that Chinese restaurant food tastes worse than cat food or that Chinese restaurants serve cat meat. I called her out and she quickly told me I couldn’t take a joke. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
11,pz90mf,Any business running on tiny profit margins (like restaurants) will cut corners to save money. Seems idiotic to suggest that only Chinese ones do that
12,pz90mf,"I was on my hometown’s facebook group and so many posts always reminisce about how the town “used to be,” and a lot of us Asian American kids felt like it was a euphemism for white flight and the general change of business demographics. They always complain about all the new asian business (that honestly put our town on the radar, its good food!) as if it’s some kind of grand scheme to exclude other ethnicities… when really asian (like from mainland) businesses see potential in our area’s demographic of young Asian-Americans with buying power. Someone I know finally called people out for it, and although the response was supportive, the same people that would make those microagressive posts were the same ones “condemning any racism on this page.” The cognitive disconnect was so concerning…. And a lot of our immigrant parents were not the ones on that page, and couldn’t see the sentiments expressed. It was really uncomfortable and I’ve since just left."

15,pz90mf,"Fiancé’s family restaurant were one of the first to mask up in Jan 2020 to protect themselves and customers 🤷🏻‍♂️. It’s funny how I’ve never gotten sick from any Asian restaurant 30 years in the US, and I most assuredly eat at Asian places more often than the average person. I think maybe people do actually experience stomach issues as a result of Asian restaurants, but I doubt it has that much to do with sanitation."
16,pz90mf,"Was a restaurant kid growing up, and yeah it's a real doozy having to rely on the cousin-fucking small-town folks in my area for income. I never told anyone growing up which place my parents owned because I knew it'd eventually be used to make fun of me."
17,pz90mf,"I would say Asians in general are foodies. We demand variety, freshness, and good taste. You can’t cut corners to good taste and I would bet a good percentage of westerners would rank Asian food as one of their favorites. If any cuisines cut corners, it would be the fast food franchise where 16 year old high school teens are the main cook. Quickly jumping to Chinese food is just flat out racist."
18,pz90mf,"Chinese restaurants are subject to the same regulations and inspections as are all other restaurants and there's no reason to believe that they receive special treatment. Why would they? An interesting note is that the last major food poisoning incidences were at Jack in the Box, Chipotle, and KFC. Neither PF Chang nor Panda Express, for example, have been subject to such controversy. Here in the S.F. Bay Area, we've not seen any spikes in food poisoning tied to Asian restaurants; though, we've seen more than a few racist criticisms regarding menu offerings."
19,pz90mf,"None of these people who complain about dirty Chinese restaurants even know how to cook Chinese food. If they were truly cutting corners most Americans wouldn't be able to tell so it's just pure xenophobia. I laugh every time white people tell me of an authentic Japanese place and I hear Korean behind the counter. Chinese restaurants have a stereotype and Americans will find any way to reinforce their opinion, not much you can do."

22,pz90mf,"It doesnt help that food safety has been a huge issue in China. Has it gotten better over there? Not saying theyre right, but can understand the context. But to say all chinese restaurants in the west are cutting corners is blatantly ignorant and racist."
23,pz90mf,"Like sure, maybe in some places in China where they have different food and health safety laws, ""cutting corners"" is a thing, but this is the US (I assume). 

There are much more stringent laws when it comes to food safety here..."
24,pz90mf,"Pointing at the mulberry and cursing the locust tree. Attack the restaurants instead of the people, then pretend it’s not about race.

And have long become a normal part of accepting ""foreign culture."" The way every character who was brown in the past was derogatorily referred to as ""Haji"" including Fez in something as recent as That 70s Show.

A lot of white people act like society is changing for the worse where they have to be PC culture and not say certain things. I sometimes feel like I agree but THIS is a no brainer. The reason why white people, or westerners in general, don't consider caricatures of Asians derogatory or offensive is because they all believe in the stereotypes. They don't see the difference between other Asians. You're all the same. You're Chinese or related to Jackie Chan. And the experience growing up in a conservative or a liberal area doesn't matter. Its the same. And the problem is overall the community believes it; including the ones who think they are against racists. You'll even catch some white people state that even if you're a naturalized citizen, you shouldn't have the same weight in votes as others just because they look passable as an American and you look Asian.

But yeah because there's a stereotype we're all math wiz's and neat freaks, we're supposed to be flattered and even other minorities gaslight us for the sole fact that the collective Asian race is summed up as ""math wiz"" thus for whatever reason invalidating all the racist experience we go through. Don't even get me started on the idiots who call Asians white adjacent. These people are hiding their own racism in plain sight as well. You can be racist to any group, anyone can be racist.

I had decided to go back to college as a 40 something adult. I was proud of myself and unafraid of going back. I saw a listing for a job in the business office and applied. The interviewer had the ""Asian fetish"". He tried to engage me in conversation by giving me a personal email and talking about his asian wife. He kept stringing me along saying I might get the job, it'll just take a long time to get an answer. In the meantime, he propositioned me, asking me to meet him at an empty house he was trying to sell. I said no, a few days later I get turned down for the job. This is after he strung me along for 3 mos. When I filed a complaint under the title ix provisions, my harasser said that ""because I'm asian, there is a language barrier and I misunderstood him"". A LANGUAGE BARRIER?!?! IM F-ING ADOPTED YOU MORON! Sadly, the board reviewing my complaint agreed. He still works there. I ended up dropping out of college for the second time. I'm shaking right now just thinking about it. I called an attorney once to try to get advice, if I even had grounds for any legal recourse, she just laughed at me on the phone, so I hung up and gave up.

0,dirgpr,"Hey r/asianamerican community, I've posted a few of my creative projects here before and appreciate the support and dialogue this community provides. I created a new podcast with fellow comedian and amazing human Youngmi Mayer. After a lifetime of repressing our emotions, we're ready to let them all out. Each week we unpack a topic through the Asian-American experience in an emotionally honest and vulnerable way. On our most recent episode, we unpacked the complicated dynamics of Asian parenting and how that might affect dating, and as a mother herself Youngmi discusses how she rectifies the abusive parenting she received. You can check it out at the links below:

* Feelings!!!!

* Y'all have great chemistry, seems very natural.

* Can relate to pretty much everything you both are saying, I feel so seen

* It's super cool that Youngmi has taken the ""less traveled path"" but it's all augmented by her excellent korean speaking, which is inspirational and guilt inducing as well.

12,dirgpr, Listened to all three episodes. Really enjoying it and there are so many relatable discussions.
13,dirgpr,"Listened to the first 2 episodes, I'm liking it so far, it feels like I'm hanging out with you two, cheers."
14,dirgpr,"Hey Yongmi, Brian,

I just want to say thanks for starting this podcast. This is a subject that just doesn't get enough attention in Asian/APIA
communities given the culture. 

Every episode thus far has resonated with me deeply because it's touched on things I've also experienced. For instance, in episode 2, when Brian is talking about his anxieties with first time sex, I can absolutely relate. In fact I've just resorted to asking my doctor for a prescription of Viagra that I can pop if I know I'll be sleeping with a woman for the first time. It has made my sex life immensely less stressful since I don't have to worry about performance anxiety during first encounters. I'm early 30's, so I don't use it otherwise, but it really helps that first time around.

I feel as a podcast on feelings, one thing I'd like to hear about is your experience on how Asian friends deal with feelings. I have friends who absolutely are not comfortable dealing with other people's feelings. Their response is basically ""I'm going to ignore your feels, and try to solve your problem, which will hopefully make the feels go away."" Which isn't particularly healthy. There isn't just an emotional gap between our generation and our parents', but also within our generation/friends as some of us who learned to be comfortable expressing ourselves, and others who have not."
0,c51tgs,So true. I grew up in the United States adopted. My tone-deaf dad said being teased for being Asian was similar to my white brother being teased for having red hair. 🙄
1,c51tgs,My favorite movie with an Asian cast recently is actually Searching with John Cho. It’s a thriller where the cast just happens to be an Asian. No idea why it’s rarely mentioned.
2,c51tgs,Somewhat. I had a hard time relating to being uber rich in Singapore...
3,c51tgs,No love for Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle??
4,c51tgs,hopefully South and Southeast Asians are next 😔
5,c51tgs,"""golden colored people"" just sounds weird... the other thing I know is occasionally mentioned as golden is goose."
6,c51tgs,"Here is my reason for calling people golden. Yellow people are called Asian American in the USA. Yet white people are not called European American. It's a topic of interest because we are all in the same boat, neo Americans who came from a different continent.

With this said, I liked the two movies because for example, in the crazy rich Asians, the word ""Asian"" is never used once (that I know of). Yellow people were seen as just humans, and it was the first time I really saw that in a movie in the USA, and it is something white people had their entire lives, seeing themselves in characters in TV."

14,s86a4l,The Lowe’s employee was so wrong it’s almost worse than the racist idiot. “David” should have immediately told the racist customer their behavior was not tolerated in Lowe’s and they need to either own up to the behavior and sincerely apologize or leave the premise immediately before the police were called for trespassing. The way he blamed it on the victim and tried to push the narrative she just needed to shut up and get over it was disgusting.

Ever been to Little Tokyo in Los Angeles? I'm sure you'd have quite the experience there. Not that it's authentically Japanese, but instead that it is a destination for many Japanese Americans and a waypoint historically as well."
1,prvpy6,Not sure where exactly you are in the Southeast but Georgia does Japan fest every year (not counting COVID years.) if that is something you are interested in. I think there is also actual clubs that focus on Japanese/American stuff. I joined the Japan-American Society of Georgia to do more networking and just making friends in my state.
2,prvpy6,"I similarly never met anyone who was Filipino ""in the wild"" when I was growing up. I still remember talking to a guy at a party when I was 16 and finding out that he was Pinoy, it was weird to actually meet someone outside of expected places.

I was actually somewhat surprised recently when NPR put out those stats/charts about Asian Americans; I would NOT have guessed that there are more Filipinos than Japanese, Korean, or Vietnamese in the US based on my personal experience. But then again, I grew up in New England. From what I gather, my experience would have been pretty different if I had been on the west coast."

This film told such a beautifully authentic story of the Chinese immigrant experience with the most batshit and insane moments ever - >!I will never forget the buttplug fight or the INCREDIBLE way they played out one of the peak emotional pieces of dialog over silence and some rocks.!< Just stellar.

3,gnazl2,"FYI this is a rehosted story from *The Washington [DC] Post*: [Asian American doctors and nurses are fighting racism and the coronavirus](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/05/19/asian-american-discrimination/).

Reading the stories about the patients who refused to be seen by Chinese-American doctors reminded me of [this *Grey's Anatomy* screencap](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DCx6E2mUQAAfaFF.jpg). I've never watched the show, but I learned this was from [a 2007 episode](https://ew.com/recap/greys-anatomy-recap-season4-episode9/) (sheesh, that show's still in production?) where a black doctor has to treat a man who has a Nazi tattoo."
4,gnazl2,"I'm a social worker working with homelessness, so I am also considered essential but not to the degree of healthcare professionals.  I've had to contend with these concepts since I was in college almost 20 years ago.  Although I have my own code of ethics to abide by, I use my best judgement to implement the best evidence based practices I know of in any position/agency I work in.  

I really feel for medical personnel since they are obligated to treat anyone who comes in whereas I can freely walk away and not provide my assistance if clients' hostility were not under control.  It tells me that people who can't restrain themselves require a higher level of care that I'm unable to provide.

That being said, I can handle a whole lot and have worked the full gamut of disabling consitions: developmentally/cognitively/behaviorally disabled, substance use, homelessness, from youths to seniors.  But I draw the line at racism.  All of us in the helping services must remember that we are human beings, and we each have our limits."

Just like Muslims in 9/11 or Hispanics during the 2016 election, there will never be a time in America where racist people aren’t racist. Racism is omnipresent no matter what country you’re in, it’s just the direction and intensity that changes over time. Don’t forget your friends, the people who stand behind us; we’ve been there in support of justice and fair treatment for other groups, now it’s their turn to support us. I think this will die down eventually, but it’s important to keep in mind that it’s almost a guarantee it will happen again, so we need to stay strong and fight. These fights are never supposed to be easy. What is easy is being eternally damned to hate a group of people for how they look, what they say, or what they’ve done."

4,ln0zq5,"I ride the same exact bus line for work. That bus stop has seen problems before. It's unlit, completely in the dark, and camped on often by the homeless. At night, it's dangerous. It's one of the few stops that has a canopy and it's often used at night as personal bedrooms. That area is dangerous for the amount of homeless it has. You always have to put your guard up in that area. Rosemead is in the San Gabriel Valley, which is the Asian part of town and a Mecca for the homeless. I have no doubt the man who attacked him is a transient. I myself have been racially attacked by homeless just waiting for the bus a number of times and have seen them attack others. That area is mostly devoid of Black people so the few black homeless people that are there often get upset with the Asian immigrants when they try to ignore them. I remember there was a black guy in a bus once just staring down Asian immigrants and yelling "" What, you've never seen a black man before?"" Riding that bus, I have heard black and white transients attack them for being immigrants. It's like the native born homeless in that area resent Asian immigrants for being better off than them and I feel like they can say whatever they want to them because they are not going to get called out on the count they are homeless.  What's more upsetting is that most people who ride the bus in that area are Asian immigrants who don't speak much English, are elderly, usually alone and when they are attacked unprovoked, their main line of the defense is to ignore them and hope to God they don't get physically attacked. Most of the transients don't even live there and they're the ones who are upset when Asian people move in. Bottom line. I believe the transient community must be policed more. They make taking the bus a lot less safe in Los Angeles."

This article reminded me to check on the largely symbolic bill on signed in May in response to Georgia spa killings - **Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act**

>It also directs the Department of Justice to designate a point person to expedite the review of hate crimes related to COVID-19 and authorizes grants to state and local governments to conduct crime-reduction programs to prevent and respond to hate crimes.

Looks like Grace Meng (D-NY) and Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) were complaining about it on [September](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/asian-hate-law-enforce/2021/09/20/2f393644-1a1f-11ec-bcb8-0cb135811007_story.html). So the law looks very modest, it says they gotta appoint 1 person to count hate crimes. It also lets the Attorney general give money to local cops to count hate crimes. Looks like nobody really cares.

>. In 2020, the number of agencies participating in the reporting effort fell for at least the second consecutive year — to 15,136, which is 422 fewer than in 2019. Of agencies that did participate, more than 12,000 reported no hate crimes, Clarke said."

It’s not like The Bachelor is catering to educated or even mildly intelligent people. 

I maybe watched one episode and I wonder “do these ‘contestants’ honestly believe this is any way to begin a serious relationship or even remotely anyway to meet anyone?”

Seriously... these people been in relationships? Like good ones? I’m legitimately asking because I’m pretty sure they just take the most idiotic and toxic men and women and see how fucked up they treat each other lol 

Why people watch The Bachelor or other similar “reality” (hard air quotes) tv is beyond my comprehension. It is the mental equivalent of high fructose corn syrup. It’s so broken down and literally basic that your body doesn’t need to do anything to process it.

Yet, I’ve already been asked four times by both American students and Chinese international students as to whether I should even celebrate this holiday; both because I’m Vietnamese and American."

3,andlre,"In elementary school, the teachers called it ""Chinese New Year"" instead of ""Lunar New Year."" They talked about the red envelopes, and we may have watched a video of a lion dance and read a picture book about Chinese New Year.

I remember being asked by a teacher to deliver a ""Happy New Year"" announcement on the school-wide news in Chinese. I did not speak Mandarin or Cantonese. I pointed out the teacher's mistaken assumption and she looked very embarrassed.

At home and Korean language school, I learned about the lunar calendar and Korean traditions on seollal: performing sebae, receiving sebae don (usually in plain white envelopes or silk bags and almost never in red envelopes, in my experience -- the red envelopes aren't really a Korean custom), eating ddeokguk and jeon, etc.

Edit: Clarified a sentence."
4,andlre,"I find it interesting a lot of people say they didn't learn about Lunar New Year in elementary school.

> To kickstart the discussion: If you went to elementary school in the U.S. / North America, how was it learning about Lunar New Year at school versus experiencing at home?

In school, there was only a very brief mention of Chinese New Year, including the 12 animals. Even worse for me, being half Vietnamese, was how Tết was only mentioned in the context of the Vietnam War: ""The Tet Offensive, named after the Vietnamese new year, was an attack..."" Here we get one of, if not THE, most important holidays of the year get reduced to playing second fiddle to a conflict.

I'm glad that my family has always celebrated the lunar new year with enthusiasm every year, with lots of gifts, red envelopes, decorations, lanterns, and dishes, and I get to experience both Chinese and Vietnamese traditions and food. This year, I am away from family, but we have still exchanged red envelopes, and I have made special dishes as a way to celebrate."

Random new year thoughts. 

My mom arbitrarily chose her own birthday, because HER mom said Lunar New Year is my mom’s birthday. But of course the date is really a range and it changes every year. 



This year my mom will be out of state with her elder sister who isn’t doing well, taking her to doctors. My dad is also out of state. Without either of them, this lunar new year feels very lonely.  I’m forcing some family here to come together anyway, but I also feel sad that every holiday - western or eastern - I’m the only one making these big dinners happen.  I question if anyone cares. But it matters a lot to me to have these family gatherings while elders are still alive. 


Now that I am married, I am completely embracing the Chinese style of gifting money for occasions. I’ve never been good at thinking of personal gifts, so this has been a stress relief...and everyone loves getting money! New baby? Red envelope for you! Baby’s first birthday? Here this is for their college fund. Getting married? Red envelopes for everyone! And they’re pretty. 
"
15,andlre,"I didn’t learn about lunar new year at school, only at home. When I was a kid, I received red envelopes sent from my fam in Okinawa. That was about all back then, but now my mom and I go to an Okinawan Lunar New Year celebration on most years (in Texas) When I’m in Japan at that time of year, I gift red envelopes too. It’s interesting (to me at least) that when in Japan I go to the shrine in Jan 1, but in Texas we celebrate based on lunar calendar. 

Anyway - happy new year!! I’d love to hear how others celebrate. "
16,andlre,"I never learned about Lunar New Year in elementary school, only at home. However, if the new year landed on a school day, my mother would always let me skip school that day and we'd go into NYC (we lived in the suburbs) and celebrate in Chinatown or Flushing. "

I don't know if they still do it since the main teacher is no longer there.

My mom didn't teach me much about lunar new year, but we would get decorations, food, and set up ancestral altar for praying. Also, had the local Tet festivals too."

In elementary school, some of my teachers would invite moms of kids in the class to come in to talk about their holidays so my mom came in and talked about Chinese New Year to my 1st and 3rd grade classes.

27,andlre,"Never learned about Lunar New Year in school, at least that I can recall. My family has never really celebrated it before, presumably because my ama didn't teach it to my mother.

28,andlre,"We never learned about lunar new year (or really any asian history at all) in my public schools. It was only in college that we had new year celebrations, and that was because the school had a bigger asian population than where I grew up..."

Everyone else asked the other Asian how to use chopsticks instead of me when our teacher ordered chinese food for everyone. 

We used tissue paper to learn how to fold paper lanterns or something too. 

Subsequent years, all my other asian friends would skip school for new years while i was always in class. There weren't many of us in the grade though, like ~4 until 5th grade."
30,andlre,"I went to school in the Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District, which is located in Southern California in the greater Los Angeles area. We didn't cover Lunar New Year, let alone any actual Asian-American history in our classes. If there was any mention of it, it was called Chinese New Year instead of Lunar New Year. 

I remember in my childhood days, my family did celebrate Lunar New Year, although we're Filipino. We had our usual food items, family and friends, and lots of red envelopes to pass around - but not without cleaning the hell out of the house first. My dad hung up some grapes over a door/window for good luck after we were done.

At home, it's just going out for dinner with my extended family, giving them gifts, and receiving lai see that would be quickly squandered within the next two weeks. (Nowadays, I just use it as investment money)

Compared to my past schools where they'd have huge CNY parties, my tech school didn't celebrate it much outside of some ""Happy CNY!"" tweets and my Python professor (non-Asian dude) talking about giving people lai see containing $500 worth of Monopoly money (I suggested chocolate coins instead; people would enjoy it more)."

1,w44ftr,"This is a wonderful read and thank you for sharing your experience. I was at the Pearl Harbor exhibit in Hawaii a few years ago when I was a senior in High School and it was very eye-opening to see the Japanese-American experience during those times. Back then, you could literally buy a license that said ""Jap Hunting license"" and it was fine. I also never learned about any of this in school. If we ever discussed Japanese internment, it would be very superficial and white-washed.

Your post also reminded me of Daniel Dae Kim's moving speech to the United States Congress. He states:

""When we are erased from our history books, we are made invisible to our own society, and the result is, As Congresswoman Meng so eloquently put it, “we are perpetually made to feel like foreigners in our own country.” Include our stories. Because they matter."""
2,w44ftr,"Also a yonsei (and half fifth Gen Chinese). I just spent last week learning about Japanese incarceration through an amazing program for teachers put on by the JACL, hosted at the Japanese American National Museum, and funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities. Wow, there was so much I did not know, and this is from someone who tried to learn about the history and hasn’t just relied on what is taught in schools and in museums like the WWII museum! The history really is brushed over, both by history textbooks/museums who whitewash it and our families who didn’t speak of it due to shame/trauma.  I do recommend the Japanese American National Museum (though it pretty much stops after WWII and I wish it had more present day info) and the Wing Luke Museum in Seattle for anyone who hasn’t gone. 

I have found it pretty amazing to get more in touch with the Japanese American community in the last couple of years as there has been more virtual events. My family became disconnected from the community after WWII, so I didn’t even know what words like Nikkei or Yonsei meant (I had heard of Issei and Nissei) until relatively recently. 

I’ve found it harder to find 4th/5th generation Chinese Americans, but a lot more Japanese Americans are yonseis and goseis and mixed ethnicity/race. So it’s easier to find people with shared experiences of being the perpetual foreigner and not really fitting in with either whites or Asians."
3,w44ftr,"Also, just to vent a bit about Reddit, it still irks me 5 years later that some of my most “controversial” posts here on Reddit are me trying to explain why incarcerating Japanese Americans was racist. Because there are STILL too many people who argue that it was not."
4,w44ftr,"there's a reason why they say history is written by the victors 

the one interesting tidbit i learned was that the allies didn't know about the holocaust until well after the war started. 

so while the historical framework is 'the allies stopped the evil nazis,"" it's more ""one group of countries stopped another group of countries from invading, and inadvertently stopped a genocide"""
5,w44ftr,"Thank you for sharing your experience OP, your description of your family's multigenerational struggle against anti-Japanese racism is really poignant and painful. 

I really identify with the struggle of feeling like a foreigner, not only in the U.S. as an Asian but also among other Asian Americans who are more recent immigrants or are 2nd gen. I don't have the ""immigrant parent"" experience and I'm not fluent in Cantonese. I do have intergenerational trauma from the anti-Asian racism my family has experienced in our 5 generations in the U.S.

I'm 5th gen Chinese American also from the bay. My U.S.-born grandpa fought in WWII Germany in the American army but faced racism from his unit. Nobody wanted to sleep in the same tent as him because he was Chinese. 

The perpetual foreigner issue is real, our family histories are proof of that and I think multigen Asian Am narratives are so important for understanding Asian Americans' history and present."
6,w44ftr,"Gosei here, I haven't been there personally but friends have and they expressed many of the same concerns you have. Unfortunately this is the way things will always be for Japanese in America. Casual jokes about being nuked or kamikazes are rampant, thanks to the internet and people's propensity to gather in virtual echo chambers, Imperial Japan's war crimes are common knowledge.

But I think it is crucial to note that this sort of attack is becoming more persistent towards all groups. The internet has opened up a vast wealth of knowledge for those to look for it. Unfortunately many are looking for ways to validate their bigotry towards others and history has a way of providing them."
7,w44ftr,"I appreciate your thoughts on this. I went to the museum right after that pacific wing exhibit opened. It was around 2000. I'm Chinese American , second generation,  and grew up in a white town suburb of New Orleans. Even though I'm not Japanese I was really offended by all of the propaganda art that I saw there. And that's the main thing I remembered. It was my first time seeing anything like that. I wasn't in a great place at the time. I tried talking about that and the white friends I was around just joked about being really racist while acting like they weren't....the ironic thing is most of the racist stuff I heard was from all of my ""friends"" 

I've never gone back since."
8,w44ftr,">All she could say was her family struggled too and I shouldn't be   
complaining. Her grandpa was mayor of a small town in Illinois and her   
parents both got to go to college without debt. Their struggle as white   
Americans was completely different given that they had significantly   
more opportunities. From a superficial perspective they seem to be doing  
 well in a massive gated community that only had to struggle for 5-10   
years not 4 generations.

It's a way of ignoring white supremacy, and basically justifying the fact that Asian Americans will never be ""American"" enough."

12,w44ftr,"Theresa a big ww2 related museum in [Hawaii too](https://pearlharbor.org/), tho it's been a while since I went. It would be interesting to see your take of the Hawaii one vs Nola one.. to see if there are regional differences in the portrayal of the war and whats emphasized and its effects."
13,w44ftr,"I spent nearly 20 years in New Orleans and never visited the museum because I assumed it would be some Greatest Generation US booster stuff. 
I assume they operate with some federal support? 
Anyhow, I think a petition listing your concerns would have some impact, I know the people creating exhibits are supposed to have a stellar reputation. 
I agree anti-Asian racism is rampant and unspoken. Being that most tourists come from Alabama, Texas, Florida etc they are certainly catering to their demo.  But I do think TripAdvisor, major tourism media, etc would take note if the museum was dinged for its bias. 
I think an effort would be made to improve and correct things, if it were pointed out and backed up by a large group of supporters of all races. I would sign it."
14,w44ftr,"Thanks for writing this. If you ever get a chance to visit Hiroshima, be sure to visit the [Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum](https://hpmmuseum.jp/?lang=eng). I didn't expect to have such a visceral emotional reaction to museum, especially since I'm normally a really calm person, but I still remember exiting the doors of the museum and walking into the bright sun. I could barely speak because I was so moved by what I had just seen. 

My great aunt survived the Hiroshima bombing (she lost family and her body was permanently scarred from the neck down). She never forgave the US, and wouldn't ever visit us in the US, even though we thought it would help her psychology. After going through the museum, and seeing the horrors that she had to go through, I can see why she felt that way. 

>I don't speak Japanese or Cantonese and I can't connect with most ABC or recent Japanese immigrants.

I know what you mean about feeling cutoff from your heritage because of language. I'm nisei, so I could understand a little bit of Japanese, but I always felt like a fraud growing up whenever I was around other Japanese people. Because of the pandemic, I took the time to really study Japanese, and to learn how to read and talk better. I'm glad I did it, as I can really understand Japanese culture better, but to be honest, even if you learn your heritage languages (Japanese and Cantonese in your case) you'll probably still feel this sense of ""otherness"" that won't completely go away.  

Take a look at Utada Hikaru. She's a mega-popular singer in Japan, but even though she's fully bilingual (she was born in New York), even she feels this sense of displacement in both countries. She always feels like she's on the outside looking in, whether she's in Japan or the US.  She talks about t[his here](https://youtu.be/kUETJQEOPdY?t=183). 

So my main point is that, don't feel bad if you can't speak your heritage language.  I used to think it was the answer, but while it does allow you to deepen your understanding of your cultural heritage and connect to more people, the fact that we are minorities living in the US, you'll always feel a bit alien living in your home country. 

>My ex gf is white and couldn't grasp what it's like to be split between multiple cultures.

I know what you mean. I didn't realize how much of a big deal until my last girlfriend, who was Taiwanese-American. Suddenly, we were on the same wavelength about so many things, because we both knew what it was like to be Asian-Americans in the US.  Things were just so much smoother. With my non-Asian girlfriends, I had to give more explanations, or why I was reacting to things a certain way. 

>Ultimately, I'm not able to relate to most Asians around the bay in general. 

If you ever feel the desire to move away, it can help. When I moved cities, I suddenly clicked with other Asians a bit more. 

>I hope to one day move past this and find a community that has gone through the same experience. I've found a small group of 2nd and 3rd gen Americans (white, latin, and asian), but their stories are unique and we only can draw parallels to our families histories. 

You write well. I hope you document more of your own personal observations as well as your family's history. Like you said, it's important that things are forgotten."
15,w44ftr,"I'm a first gen Chinese / Japanese American. I recently visited the museum in NOLA too. My husband is white and the first thing he said to me was ""wow this is a lot of American propaganda!"" He was pretty incensed with their depictions of the bomb, how they downplayed murdering civilians etc. And instead focused on the science part. They also did not give credit to the other Allies or speak much about the Chinese experience. 

It's hard to talk to this with my family because there's a lot of animosity from my mom's side (We are from Nanjing, they lost absolutely everything in the war) and my dad's side, my Japanese grandma was left behind in a failed planned Japanese settlement as a child and eventually became assimilated into Chinese culture. My mom's side still has animosity towards Japanese and is very offended of war criminals having statues dedicated to them at shrines, and text books omitting Japanese war crimes.

I think that the more we educate people about history and what actually happened, the more people can take in information sources like the WWII museum with a grain of salt, understand the perspective and heavy bias, and identify propaganda. Museums could do better at presenting other perspectives, but I also know what they're going to cater to."

17,w44ftr,"If you’re looking for more places to visit, I suggest looking into the National Parks systems. They’ve been revisiting a lot of history to make it more inclusive. I remember visiting Angel Island in San Francisco and was delighted by the way exhibits have approached racist history. Fort Missoula in Montana is currently running a campaign to raise funds to preserve the camps that were used to incarcerate Japanese (and Italian) nationals during the war. And lots of historical locations from California to Florida are starting to highlight the contributions of Asians in America complete with dedications and funding to teach visitors of this portion of history which is often whitewashed."

He said all"
19,w44ftr,"As a Chinese-American who lives in New Orleans and has been to the museum at least a few times, thank you for your honest review. 

I first visited the museum when I was in grade school (late 2000s early 2010s). During that time the only exhibits at the museum were the D-Day invasion of Normandy and US Merchant Marine Gallery (I think) . It was indeed heavily US-centric with a majority of its focus on military campaigns in the European theater. I honestly couldn't remember them talking about the holocaust or German war crimes that much.

The last time I visited the museum was back in 2019, before Covid happened. I had to go to the museum as part of an assignment for a museum class I was taking. I visited pretty much most of the exhibits old and new  except for the Road to Berlin one because I was short on time (weird because it was located in the same pavilion as the Road to Tokyo). I was glad that they finally mentioned the Asian theater of WWII in depth which has a huge tendency to be overlooked. I also liked how they at least acknowledged the Japanese-American internment with an exhibit (however like you mentioned there are still major oversights). 

When my class discussed the WWII museum later on many people brought up that the museum seemed to present things in a US-centric way. For me I agreed, even though I felt that the museum has improved its content over the past years. I do hope that they can continue to improve (they're constantly building new exhibits anyways)."
20,w44ftr,"I just wanted to say I think it's incredible that you're a 4th gen. full Asian American. That means two generations of Asians above you who grew up in America found other Asian partners, got married, and had at least one kid. Given the gender divides in our ""community"" these days that's pretty impressive. I find that these days the ability to maintain your Asianness in such a hostile environment where we are such a small minority is just as impressive as fighting a war.

Also, you might want to check out the book No-No Boy by John Okada."
21,w44ftr,"Lmao what, the Imperial Japan is downplayed or barely mentioned in media compared to the Nazis. Japan got off incredibly lightly while its victims still suffer the consequences."
22,w44ftr,"Damn. All I can say is I'm not surprised by any of this but it's still disappointing. I'm sorry your family went through all of that and you should be so proud that they were able to persevere through all that to be where you are now.

There is so much propaganda ingrained in the heads of Americans it's crazy ... Hitler drew inspiration for his methods through observation of America's systemic racist laws. And those gas chamber showers? That was a copy of chemical baths from the US-Mexico border that was used on immigrants."
23,w44ftr,That was a good read OP. For me the least patriotic I have ever felt was when I visited Saigon/Ho Chi Min City  in Vietnam and went to the Vietnam War Museum. Its the complete opposite of what you experienced and I couldn't help walking away with the impression that the U.S Army were complete barbaric monsters in that war. There was this one exhibit I'll never forget about agent orange with preserved deformed fetuses and pictures of people who grew up with horrible birth defects that basically ruined entire gene pools for generations to come. I don't smoke but I literally went outside and asked for a cigarette from one of my MBA classmates that did. Its probably too much to expect that level of self reflection in a museum or memorial in the U.S but I have also heard museums in Germany are pretty severely self critical about WWII. Also total side note but Grave of the Fireflies should be required viewing for anyone who thinks the U.S response in WWII including the atom bombs were completely justified...I mean how many dozens of people did we lose at Pearl Harbor vs millions of innocent Japanese citizens from firebombing on top of the nukes?
24,w44ftr,So your gripes is the museum didn't in paint the Nazi as badly as imperial Japan????
25,w44ftr,"Are the things the IJA did not savage? I'm confused, do you identify with imperial japan? Because you are mixing a lot of things here. What happened to Japanese Americans has nothing to do with the atrocities imperial japan committed.

Not enough is spoken about what the IJA did, whereas Nazi Germany has been discussed to death.

Also, trying to downplay what Japan did by pointing to the US and Germany is not a good look. You should knock that shit off."
26,w44ftr,"But Japan doesn't even acknowledge their WWII atrocities and many Japanese don't know what happened because it's not mentioned in their history textbooks. The US may have some biases, but at least they tell both sides of the story while Japan probably doesn't have a museum about this at all and just takes the victim mentality because of the bombings while not knowing the full story of what they did as the aggressor not a sole victim."

14,hpvrt1,"This is yet another example of why it’s important for people to stop viewing us as a monolith - and equally important for us to do the same when examining ourselves. There are hundreds of ways you could slice up the Asian American experience, and dozens of more ways to slice up each regional and nationality identity from there.

Many Vietnamese families had members fighting on opposite sides of the war. When you take the time to reflect on the implications of this, the fact that such a great divide could exist at this atomic level of human relationships, it shouldn’t be surprising that we struggle to align on BLM in this moment. There is so much complexity that gets erased when our narrative is painted with a broad brush.

I wish we were all collectively better at making space for more “AND” in our stances. As Vietnamese Americans, we need to advocate for Black lives AND stand against Communism in our motherland. One of the uncomfortable ways this manifests in my activism is how I cringe every time someone calls me “comrade”. This is reminiscent of the stuff our parents, aunts, and uncles were indoctrinated with in concentration camps, so it’s no wonder they would protest this billboard considering their perception of what it stands for. Meanwhile, can we can blame the BLM movement for railing against capitalism under the banner of socialism? How do we make space within ourselves for both perspectives, take a stance, and reimagine a future that honors both Vietnamese and African American histories? How do we speak up and make use of our unique place in history to guard against repeating the atrocities suffered by both groups?

What we need to get better at is understanding our own history, political and economic systems, and leveraging that knowledge so we can have more informed and empathetic discussions within our communities and across generations. WHILE overcoming language barriers. And the trappings of the model minority myth. And warding off criticism from Blacks, Whites, other Asians, our elders, and everyone in between about how we aren’t doing enough (and most of us aren’t). THIS is the real work."

0,d8r9mz,">Ms. Miller writes: “I am not Brock Turner’s victim. I am not his anything. I don’t belong to him. I am also half Chinese. My Chinese name is Zhang Xiao Xia, which translates to Little Summer.” In naming herself, Ms. Miller takes control of the narrative on her own terms and opens up more space for others who choose to do so. No longer anonymous, it is the power of this specificity that creates an even stronger sense of solidarity.

Her declaration here gave me full-body shivers. Such a courageous, powerful, heroic woman. Such a gifted writer too. I'm so proud that she's one of our own, and I'm so impressed by how the AA community has rallied around Chanel Miller."
1,d8r9mz,"When Emily Doe’s victim impact statement was published on BuzzFeed in June 2016, I read it in one breathless sitting. The previous day, she had read her statement at the sentencing hearing for Brock Turner, who was found guilty of three counts of felony sexual assault by a California jury. The maximum sentence for such a conviction was 14 years, but the judge, Aaron Persky, sentenced Mr. Turner to six months in county jail. He served three. Emily Doe’s statement went viral, read aloud on the floor of the House of Representatives and on CNN, and fueled public outrage over Mr. Turner’s lenient sentence. Later that year California imposed mandatory minimum sentences for sexual assault crimes and in 2018, voters recalled Judge Persky.

I connected with Emily Doe’s fury over Mr. Turner’s lack of remorse and how the legal system dehumanizes survivors of sexual violence, from Mr. Turner’s father arguing that his son’s life was ruined by “20 minutes of action” to the defense lawyer interrogating the victim about her clothing choices and drinking habits. This month, Chanel Miller revealed herself to be Emily Doe, and her memoir, “Know My Name,” was published this week.

When I learned Ms. Miller is white and Chinese-American, I realized I’d first assumed that Emily Doe was white, a reminder of how often we internalize whiteness as a default in America. Ms. Miller is more than her racial identity alone, but the knowledge that she is Asian-American necessitates a new understanding of what she experienced and how she was perceived — as a woman of color, assaulted by a white man, trying to obtain justice in a courtroom presided over by a white male judge.

When sentencing Mr. Turner, who was a student at Stanford University at the time of the assault, the legal system took into account his athletic and academic achievements. In her statement, Ms. Miller challenged this approach, writing, “If a first-time offender from an underprivileged background was accused of three felonies and displayed no accountability for his actions other than drinking, what would his sentence be?”Mr. Turner’s treatment during the case, and his light sentence, quickly became a symbol for many of elite, white male privilege. Judge Persky, a Stanford alumnus, was criticized as seeing Mr. Turner as entitled to future professional achievements. In contrast, Ms. Miller, who had not attended Stanford, had her own achievements dismissed and her history attacked, her “lost potential” not highlighted in the courtroom.

In her memoir, Ms. Miller writes about how growing up Asian-American had made her feel “used to being unseen, to never being fully known. It did not feel possible that I could be the protagonist.” Asian-American women intersect with racism and sexism in ways that are shared by women of other races and also unique to us. It’s impossible to acknowledge the dehumanization of and violence against Asian women — including hypersexualization, exoticization and fetishization — without connecting it to a long history of American colonialism, imperialism and militarization in Asian countries. Sexual and gender-based violence occurs across racial and ethnic lines, as well as commonly within our own ethnic communities.

A 2015 study by the Asian Pacific Institute on Gender-Based Violence found that between 21 percent and 55 percent of Asian-American women experience physical or sexual violence from intimate partners, with rates varying based on ethnicity. We’ve also been found to report rape and other forms of sexual violence less frequently than women of other races. A lack of financial resources as well as trauma, immigration status, risk of alienation from families and communities, and mistrust of the criminal justice system are only some of the reasons one might choose not to report an assault or publicly accuse an assailant.But contrary to stereotypes of Asian-Americans as silent or submissive, we continue to speak out against sexual violence, from Ms. Miller, Amanda Nguyen, Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha and Emma Sulkowicz to high-profile figures like Connie Chung and many other survivors, in the United States and abroad, who lack a public platform.

The legal system, and institutions such as Ivy League universities, have historically been invested in protecting wealth, white supremacy and patriarchy. Women, both cis- and transgender, are disproportionately affected by sexual violence, and while a vast majority of rapes in the United States are reported by white women, women of color, especially black and Native American women, are more likely to be assaulted. Three out of four sexual assaults are not reported to law enforcement, and although incarceration is not synonymous with justice, accountability or rehabilitation, only five out of 1,000 perpetrators receive prison time.Survivors of sexual violence, especially those from marginalized groups, often fail to receive justice from a system that is biased against them from the start. Half of those who do report say that they are then re-traumatized by law enforcement, which may blame them for their own assaults.

There is no singular, or universal, survivor experience. In her anonymity as Emily Doe, Ms. Miller created what she calls an “empty space” for healing, a place for survivors “to step into and speak aloud their heaviest truths, to revisit the untouched parts of their past,” regardless of their backgrounds: “How do you come after me, when it is all of us?”.

We must continue to center survivors, with all of their intersecting identities, whether or not they choose to publicly share their traumas. We must support, confront and disrupt, and work to eradicate systemic issues of toxic masculinity, rape culture and sexual violence, which are perpetuated even by those residing in the White House and on the Supreme Court.

Ms. Miller writes: “I am not Brock Turner’s victim. I am not his anything. I don’t belong to him. I am also half Chinese. My Chinese name is Zhang Xiao Xia, which translates to Little Summer.” In naming herself, Ms. Miller takes control of the narrative on her own terms and opens up more space for others who choose to do so. No longer anonymous, it is the power of this specificity that creates an even stronger sense of solidarity."

0,ba1puy,The amount of casual racism towards Asians is disgusting. You see it blatantly on reddit as well.  I’d be rich if I got a dime for every time I read a Sum Ting Wong comment on here.  The worst thing is those dumbass “I’m Asian and I don’t find this offensive” comment afterwards. Like who made you the official representative of all Asians?
1,ba1puy,"I’ve gone through similar experiences as an Asian male at a mostly white school, so I feel I can relate in at least some way. We have to be more assertive and let people know that that kind of behavior isn’t okay, even if it is “casual”.  I can’t tell you how many comments I’ve gotten from other people over the years about eating dogs or having small eyes and I used to just ignore it and let it silently chip away at me. But people do tend to stop if you call them out about it, because a lot of the time it is simply ignorance... especially if you live in an area that doesn’t have a lot of other Asians.  Inform them of their ignorance in a graceful way, which I know is easier said than done.  I feel your pain, and there are times I experience that same self-hatred. But we’re all worth so much more than that. We have to lead good lives that will help other people see past the harmful stereotypes of Asians. "
2,ba1puy,"Yep people think it's ok to say things like ""flied lice"" in front of you. One of our PAs actually left the last clinic she worked at because one of the nurses kept saying racist things about her adopted Korean daughters. She just called in on Sunday night and said I quit. The funny thing is the racist nurse had never said anything like that to her before November 2016."
3,ba1puy,"I totally feel you. I’m also adopted and grew up in white middle class America but to make the racism even more fun, I lived in SC. I got mostly a lot of bullying about my nose, jokes about eating dogs, and as I got older men thought it was funny to say that line from Full Metal Jacket to me (a movie I’ve never seen and don’t plan on seeing but like every lame white guy thinks is hilarious and think they’re the first one to say it to me 🙄). 

I agree with another person who said in certain parts of America you just get used to being “other.” The way I’ve dealt with it is through traveling, meeting other people of color who have similar (and sometimes worse) stories of racism, and reading books and articles by other transracially adopted people (Nicole Chung’s book “All you can ever know” is especially good). Therapy also helps as it sounds like you’ve been fighting internally with these issues for years. So if you’re comfortable with doing that, I found it very helpful. 

I hope as you get older it gets easier for you. I’m in my 40s now and I simply have no time for that bullshit. Plus I’m loud and opinionated so I think that may shield me sometimes :) However when I was younger I was very quiet and shy so I totally feel your story about how scared and hurt you felt as a child and teen. It gets better but it definitely can haunt you. Good luck to you! "
4,ba1puy,"Not exactly a childhood story, but I was in a restaurant the other day ordering takeout when the waiter comes out. He forgot who ordered the food, so instead of calling out the number, he tells someone else to do it. He says to the other man, “I don’t know who’s this is. All I know it was some Asian.” His black coworker says to the other man, “Aren’t Asians able to make they’re own damn seafood?” (It was a Captain D’s). Then he points to a guy by the window and says “You see that yellow ch*** over there? That’s him.” And they go about saying some pretty disgusting things about Asian people. My [hapa Desi] mom happened to be standing by the counter while they said these things. Though Americans fail to realize that South Asians are still Asians, they didn’t know how much what they said offended the both of us.

Racism towards Asian Americans or even Asians in general is so overlooked in today’s society because of how black and white everything is. I’m not trying to disregard anyone else’s cause, but do you know how many Asian men have been killed by police officers and no one is talking about it? Do you know how many Asian Americans are forced to “put up with” discrimination just because of society’s prejudice towards them? Both casual and full on racism towards Asians is flat out ignored. If you’re not black or white, the news completely ignores your causes at this point and it’s extremely sad. 

It breaks my heart to read all of these stories. You guys shouldn’t have had to put up with these types of things, especially as children."
5,ba1puy,"Maybe it's different for me due to where I'm from and the fact I'm male, but it seems so much simpler for me. When I was bullied, we would just jump the bully and beat them until their friends arrived. And when we got older, razors and pocketknives deescalated most bullying. Those people aren't going to like us anyways, so it's better to defend yourself and not worry about their perceptions of you."
6,ba1puy,"I grew up in the West coast in white suburbs. My personal experience is that racism was much worse before my parents moved us to an upperclass neighborhood. When I was in elementary school in a working class town even the teachers made fun of my eyes and also taught students that Japanese internment was justified. Mostly it was just the usual teasing and namecallinh. 

One thing that made a huge difference for me was my father moved to the US when he was 8 and was beaten horribly for being Asian before turning to martial arts and eventually learning to shoot guns. I was always told that I could defend myself and he would back me up. He taught this to me and all my cousins so at least with kid bullies I could fight and scream and namecall with the best of them. The teachers who made fun of me I just quietly hated.

To be honest, the casual racism was something to live with. But then in middle school my uncle was murdered (it was so bad my family could ‘t do an open casket funeral) and they used the fact that he was Chinese as part of the defense. That he deserved to die because of inherent flaws with his race. It still makes my blood boil. 


It was around the time of the Rodney King riots and it was basically open season on Asians. My father started stockpiling guns, we installed a security system, and doing gun training. This is what I think about most today - violence against Asians is never treated as a hate crime. Crimes against us are underreported and because there are few Asian Am police officers and we’re a small voting block nobody cares. 

My uncle’s murder was when I truly understood what it means to be Asian American. It’s not just casual racism but that our lives are also on the line, but it doesn’t get on the news. "
7,ba1puy,"Your childhood sounds pretty much the same as mine. It was not easy.

My advice to you is that in America, in the majority of the country, you are going to constantly feel like an outsider nearly all of the time.  Even in areas with Asians you will be not Asian enough and of course never White.  

I find this is much much worse the more middle/working class and less liberally educated elite your peers are.  The sad truth is that most Americans in flyover country are neither interested nor respectful of foreign cultures and people, they literally do not know how to be respectful of an foreigner since they deal with so few, and are on top of that just not particularly interested.

When you get older I hope you will become more comfortable with who you are, but this won't change the fact that you are walking around with a sign on your head.

Try going to Honolulu, or places like Irvine CA where being an Asian American is the norm.  It's a shocking relief to suddenly blend in terms of appearance and Asian american culture.  

Finally I'll add that if anything, African American culture deals with these issues more deeply than most... Except ratchet up the violent hostility by whites and all american society by 10 to 100 compared to Asians.  This has gotten much better in my lifetime, but I find the narratives supportive."
8,ba1puy,"I can’t relate to racism in my childhood since I grew up in “asian communities,” most of my schools were 40-50% Asians and neighborhoods were mostly majority Asians, but when I went to university it‘s an entirely different story.  

I can’t count the amount of times I’ve been harassed or straight up stonewalled because of my ethnicity, despite being a “liberal school” my university is awful with diversity. 80% white and not even 6% asian.  

I stopped going to my uni’s reddit because of people telling me to suck it up and someone actually said to me “good luck in the real world if you can’t handle a little racism,” when I was pointing out the diversity issue there under “what are some problems at ____?” One of the guys that harassed me got arrested for raping a girl on campus a few months after, and people replied to me saying harassment isn’t “a serious issue.” It’s infuriating."
9,ba1puy,"I have a somewhat similar experience. I was also adopted when I was a baby into a white, middle-class family in the suburbs. I was constantly subjected to racism very similar to your experiences. Therapy helped me a lot, but the majority of my issues seemed to stem from my adoption more than racism, although for transracial adoptees, those are very intertwined. Reading about adoption, especially transracial adoption, and joining adult adoptee groups online (even going to some meetups) also helped a lot. You're not alone and knowing that can really be freeing. While I still have some self-loathing, at least I am proud to be an Asian American now. Please feel free to message me if you'd like to talk."
10,ba1puy,"The worst racism to Asians is on reddit. I have not seen such blatant racism being accepted as criticism or jokes in any other place. 

Any time I see someone stand up for themselves in the comments they just get called a shill or get accused of supporting a dictator."
11,ba1puy,"I have not experienced a lot of racism. Where are you all from? I'm from Hawaii, and I lived in NYC for a little over a decade.  The level of racism against asians I'm reading here seems unreal (not that I don't believe you). Where should I avoid going, to avoid this kind of crap? 

You guys should come to Hawaii at least once in your lives, maybe it will feel liberating. "

But nowadays since things are more PC, it probably gotten better for asian kids,( depending if u live in a place that's diverse). My sister is in middle school right now, the worst racist thing that happened is someone called her chinese. I had it 10x worst when i was younger"
16,ba1puy,"Understanding is hard work, racism however is lazy. 

My white boss, day 2 at lunch asked me if blackface were racist.

My white boss went with the ""Asians love kungfu"" stereotype for no apparent reason besides that i'm asian, so every ride along I had with him he would talk about how back in the day he took kung fu lessons.  Finally I had to shut that up by asking him why he was always bringing up kung fu. He went silent and now things are awkward. The thing is all you have to do is imagine the reverse - if I always talked about how I loved corned beef and cabbage and potatoes when I rode along with him, because he's irish american, how would he feel? 

I also had to tell him not to use the word oriental anymore, since its 2019. He made it weird, why is that my fault?

I think actually many white people don't think racism okay deep down. Otherwise why do white people get defensive about being called a racist and go out of their way to ""prove"" they are not? 

Ugh...
"
17,ba1puy,">	Why has society almost come to accept even overt racism towards asian americans/asians in general?

Two mistakes you’re making.

Firstly, there’s no “almost” about it. Overt racism towards Asians is completely acceptable in America.

Did you hear any complaints about this?

https://youtu.be/HhF3Z7DM_Sc

Or this?

https://youtu.be/hlH9RGLJqxE


Secondly, America did not “come to” accept racism against Asians. It has always been this way in America. And it probably always will be.

Everything you heard about America being a “melting pot” where ancestry doesn’t matter is a lie. It’s only a melting pot if you’re white. If you’re Asian, you’ll be considered perpetually foreign even if your family’s been here 200 years. And you’ll be considered inferior. Our ancestors didn’t realize this when they came here because they believed the propaganda.

The sooner you realize this, the better. Then you’ll start to realize the problem isn’t you. The problem is that America is a white supremacist country. America just doesn’t want to admit it.

I’m sorry your white parents are so inequipped to help you deal with this.

If you don’t know many Asians and your idea of being Asian comes from the toxic American media, you’ve probably absorbed negative ideas about being Asian. The best thing you can do is stop watching American media. Start watching subtitled movies from Hong Kong or Japan. Take a trip away from America and go to Asia if you can.
"
18,ba1puy,"I grew up in a middle-,upper-class metro area being the only full Asian till my senior year of highschool.  There were 2 other half Asian kids in my middle school and one of the worst acts of racism towards me was from one of them.  This was in the south and the half Asian guy wanted to be one of the good ol'boys.  He would come to school dressed in cowboy boots with the biggest belt buckle you can imagine.  While the rest of the school dressed standard popular casual styles.  We didnt have lockers in middle school and kept our books in milk crates which allowed anyone access to the books and supplies in the crates.  One day while swapping my book for my next class, someone wrote 'go home chink' on all my stuff.  I was known in school as being the stereotypical nice, quite guy but this just set something off in me and I told everyone in school that whoever wrote it to meet me after school at the park near by.  That's when I was told it was the half Asian guy that did it.  At that moment my anger turned into pity.  That he had so little self-worth and so much self-hatred that he would write that on my stuff.  After word got out that I was willing to stand up for myself it never happened again.  

Now I don't recommend fighting someone but there are ways to stand your ground when it comes to bullying.  

Looking back I am sure he made all the same standard jokes about Asians to try and fit in with the people he considered friends.  

Thankfully I had a close friend I grew up with.  Without him I am sure my childhood would have been even more difficult.  Having someone to talk to makes all the difference.  My best friend growing up wasn't Asian but he was always willing to listen to my problems.  Just being able to talk about my problems made things easier to deal with.  If you haven't tried talking to your friends or parents give that a try.  If you have and they just brush it off then follow the others advice and try to get therapy or find a group in your area.

As isolated as you might feel, there are tons of us that have experienced the ugly side of America. Always know that if you have no other options that you can find help or someone to listen here or message any of us that have offered help.

19,ba1puy,"I feel you. I’ve had a similar experience as you, I was also adopted by a caucasian couple and grew up in a mostly white neighbourhood. The scars made by racism never really leave us and we’re then stuck in an awkward in-between since we’re white in the inside but asian on the outside. 

So I just want to say that you’re not alone, let’s fight together the blatant day to day racism"
20,ba1puy,"Firstly, I'm so sorry you had such a terrible experience with racism during your childhood. As someone who grew up in a primarily Asian-American heavy town in California, I definitely cannot even imagine experiencing the degree of racism that you're describing. Are you doing better now? 

I'm definitely out of touch with the Asian-American experience in the rest of ""white"" America (I live in the Bay Area currently lol). Would you say that the racism towards Asians have gotten worse in the last couple of years, or has it gotten a bit better? I was hoping that with more Asian American representation nowadays, it would get a bit better. "

Because of this, my grade school changed my school records to be under my fake “American” name and now being out of high school, I can no longer change my records to match my birth name.

25,ba1puy,[deleted]
26,ba1puy,"I think it is courageous and brave to speak out and share these devastatingly traumatic experiences. It’s hard enough to have to live through it once, but to go through it again so as to process and put into words the humiliation, the demonizing scars, and the weight of being made to feel inferior, undesirable, and unimportant just because we’re asian is inner strength you’ve found--I hope you let it be therapeutic for you if it hasn’t already--not a complete solution, but it helps, I know it does for me.

As for the self-deprecating hate--I empathize with the pain, and even as I write this, I can recall that feeling of weighted emptiness that sits inside the bottom of my chest cavity, weighing down my breathing and hollowing me out at the same time until I’m either asphyxiated or a shell of who I am and who I could be. I don’t have the solution of healing for all, but looking back, for me, my own path of healing may have started with rediscovering my identity. It’s taken me a long time to come to terms of who I am as an Asian person, an Asian man, and a human being, and be comfortable with it. Racism towards Asian people is different compared to other races in America. It’s mostly very subtle mixed with occasional blatant bigotry and hate, all of which doesn’t get called out because most people are either indifferent or they don’t know it’s racial and hurtful and so they think, what’s the big deal? With all that bombarding me, I had to sort out a lot of bullshit to realize I’m not inferior, I’m not better, but that I am the same--I am human just like everyone else is human. We all have lives we live and we do the best to live it--on that end we’re all equal. It’s important to me to be equal and not tilt too far the other way and be superior and condescending; it only perpetuates hate, making other people feel like I did.

I also had to recognize that I’m Asian; I must accept and embrace this and not be apologetic about it. Some of it is learning about and appreciating my roots, history, culture, and recognizing the positive influences and occurrences in which it exists openly in the world to where I am locally. The next thing I did was find/list the positive and beautiful things about me, the things I’m proud of, and recognize that all of this exists in me, an Asian--when it seems the world is telling me that I’m inferior because I’m Asian, I’m able to surprise myself and the world with these contradictions: that these accomplishments, these positives, these beautiful things exist in me, an Asian. It helps me to recognize that what the “world” says about Asians is false; I had to recognize and stop believing the horrible and negative things said of Asian people, of me, and start believing in me. Once I was able to do this, I slowly started to accept and embrace myself, not just a human being, but an Asian person. And so whenever someone tries to cut me down by saying I have no business being or doing whatever because I’m Asian, I say fuck you because I know it’s a lie, I know it’s false, and I proceed on, not apologetic at all. The world tries to say something is wrong with my eyes and make me feel abnormal and ugly, I say nope, It’s who I am, my beauty is mine and I don’t need to prove it to you, and my eyes are normal and only adds to who I am as a beautiful person--I wouldn’t be me without my eyes or any other attribute that makes me, me. And that’s what makes me, perfectly me.

Coming to terms of being an Asian man was very difficult. All of it was difficult, but this one was tough because it was much more specific. I started believing all the negative perception of an Asian male not being manly enough compared to other non-asian males, being weak, and because of this inequality, it ate at my confidence and fed into the stereotype of being marginalized and not being heard by not speaking up. Of course it doesn’t help that when I do speak, there have been incidents of when I’m not taken seriously. That is huge in the work/social world--not just being marginalized, but I don’t even give myself a chance if I don’t say anything. This is something that I had to learn and practice, and it still isn’t very natural but I can at least express myself. And what I did will sound cliche, but it’s what helps me through the trauma which is self-care; I had to learn to love myself. For me, some of it was to join a fitness class (soul cycle, orangetheory, whatever..) and be part of that community and to build myself up from there, setting goals, all so that I can gain some confidence, to get some kind of win/victory. When I take care of myself and how I present myself, it starts to resonate and people begin to notice. They notice the confidence when I speak and how I carry myself, and their reaction helps to bolster my thoughts that I’m on the right path for me. Also, I didn’t think it would happen, but the opposite sex started noticing too when I previously thought it was impossible for me to be desirable. It’s not a linearly smooth path; I still encounter people that feed into the negative notion that I’m not desirable, not a real man, that I should be a good little asian boy and do what I’m told and shut up and not cause trouble. But this is why we speak out and call people out on their shit, so that this culture of indifference and negativity toward Asian people is made known and done away with, replaced with a new, positive perception--one that appreciates Asian people, and inspires a desire to learn about the many different cultures.

I’m sorry you went through so much. I can only imagine how gut-wrenching each experience was for you. I’m so glad you spoke out and shared; your strength inspires others, it inspires me, to not give up, to not back down and be a good little asian but to stand up and say I’m tired of this bullshit and the feeling of needing to stay quiet, and no it’s not okay to treat me so poorly and try to hold me down, and yes I am every bit as good and beautiful as everyone else regardless of what you say/think; my happiness isn’t based on what you think, it’s based on what I think. Stay strong and don’t give up the fight for yourself because it’s also for us too."

28,ba1puy,"As painful as they are, with these stories, personally I feel less alone and that makes a huge difference in my life. 

I'm hearing some responses to report racism at work to HR.  Just word of caution that HR is ultimately not your advocate, they are your employer's advocate. An employers response to workplace racism is not always what you expect it to be.

Childhood and workplace trauma in part due to racism is real. You may have self-hate, depression, PTSD, or other mental health issues as result. You may be coping in unhealthy ways. I have all of this.  I would suggest seeking counseling, support groups, exercising, eating right, getting on appropriate meds if necessary. You cannot go it alone, get help, take charge of your mental health. I needed to and got help starting in my late 30s, slowly but surely it gets better."
29,ba1puy,Learn to stand up for yourself. Once you do that people won’t see you as an easy target and they’ll go find other easy targets to pick on.
30,ba1puy,"I am sorry you have had these negative experiences and it is unacceptable.  I have used these racist attitudes, whether unconscious or blatant, as a way to work harder and prove people wrong.  Whatever I do I do my best to excel.  It is unfortunate that this is how it is in America but it is reality.  Be who you are and push through and know you are a better person that overcome these trials.  I personally believe things will get better in time and know you are not alone in your experiences.  "
31,ba1puy,"I’m so sorry you have to go through such terrible things. I didn’t grow up in America so there’s no way I get to experience what you experienced. Now I live in the midwest and I can see some people would hold a different attitude towards Asian people though I haven’t experienced overt racism yet. 

Tribalism is so common everywhere even in middle upper class in the US. Sometimes people say ugly things not because how much they hate other races, but simply because they’re different. It took me a long time to realize this and ever since that other people’s comments(especially race related) no long bug me. People tend to degrade others to feel good about themselves and alienate people who are different as a defense mechanism. All this is human nature and it took education and wisdom to make oneself become more accepting to difference. As for children, who lack social wisdom and education, they could easily play out the dark part of human nature. But that’s what keep humans survive till today because they inherently stick with own group (to defend against predators and gather good in the ancient time). I grew up in an Asian country so race was never something before I moved to US. But in middle school, where all my classmates were Asian and I still was made fun of for being a nerd or being  slim and I made fun of people who were fat or slow at that time.  I never hated my classmates but I behaved like a piece of shit. 

All these years I reflect upon things that I have done and have happened to me, and it became clear to me that the world is a playground for tribalism( at least in current level of human civilization). And what we always need to do what benefits us the most. I seek no validation from others and I stay cool whatever the way I’m treated. I fight back when it’s good for me and I let them have it when it’s not worthy. After all, they are only swayed by psychology. And any time wasted on those less intellectual and primitive minded people is not paying back. There’re plenty of respecting, smart, well-educated, knowledgeable people who are truly worthy of our time and friendship. 

If being a racist makes them feel good, they should continue doing it. I see no wrong in that. I think I would be mentally strong to block haters from my life. I don’t know if this helps at all for you but I want to say to you that you’re never wrong being Asian.  Those who made fun of you weren’t exactly wrong because they did what they could do. You don’t expect a blind person to see and don’t expect a deaf person to hear. You don’t expect a narrow minded person to respect. As others here have said, you could try going to a more diverse place like NYC, SF, so you can meet some people who are better educated(socially and mentally speaking ). "

34,ba1puy,It could be the other way around. You could be overly fetishized by white guys. Either way they won't give a damn about you.
35,ba1puy,"Sorry to hear your awful experience. I grew up Asian American too, in an upper-middle class suburb called Ahwatukee, or facetiously named “All-White-Tukee.” The racism ran deep. 

I got bullied and food-shamed for bringing Yakult, Kimchee, Bok Choy, etc. for lunch. (These are now things that are sold at mainstream white grocery stores that white people now love.) I frantically tried to hide my iPod in high school from prying eyes, fearful that people would make fun of me for listening to anything not in English (and now, BTS and Blackpink are mainstream). Annoying that the same people who made fun of our food and music are now consuming them, but whatever—that’s another topic. (And for the most part, I see it as trending in the right direction.) 

But the most painful moment was when I was in 3rd grade, and my dad came to my class to present on Chinese culture and share Chinese dishes from his restaurant. I was so excited and proud. But when he came, kids made fun of his accent and thought the food was “weird and gross”. Suddenly, I wasn’t proud anymore. And I was ashamed of being Chinese. 

My typical internal dialogue growing up was a vicious cycle that went like this: 1.) wanting to desperately fit in and be white 2.) feeling shame of my asian heritage 3.) feeling immense guilt for feeling shame because my parents sacrificed SO much for me, and here I am ungrateful and embarrassed of them 4.) contempt and disdain for my white peers for having such limited worldviews 5.) but they seemed to be so much cooler than I was, so back to point one. 

The only thing that makes me feel better, really, is that Asians are actually the global majority in the world, by far. And even though white people have dominated the world culturally and economically for the past few centuries, I’m positive that we’re entering an unprecedented time in history where the East will dominate the future of globalization. Historians and economists generally agree that the world is trending that way. Our kids are gonna grow up in a world where being Asian is normal—I know it :) it just takes time for others (ahem racist white people) to get out of their ethnocentric bubbles and realize that the world doesn’t revolve around them anymore. Western culture is losing TREMENDOUS cultural power, now—20 years ago in Taiwan (I’m Taiwanese, by the way)—you could totally see immense Western influence. People thought you were royalty if you were American-born. Now, Taiwanese youth are influenced by Korean and Japanese music, fashion, food, etc. They hardly bat an eye at US trends (in my limited experience).

You probably live in a low cost of living state, without much diversity, heck even the asians there are probably dumb and ugly. The solution is to do well in school, get a valuable skills and a license for a high paying job. Then move to better states with less low IQ people like California, New York, Seattle, etc. You want to go west coast, and places that cost more to live at if you want to avoid this stuff. Also, there's a big difference in California, there are low Income and high Income areas. The IQ and people are completely different and of higher socioeconomic status, and are more educated. Reading the other comments here the issue is just lack of money or value in society of our parents, which you can't help. The rich asians move to high class affluent cities with top schools, and where white is only 50% or less of the population, and they seem to love and appreciate asians there."

Can't afford to drive or Uber instead of public transportation.

Acts as if there are only two options that are completely mutually exclusive - helping the homeless or tougher policing/prosecution.

Is it really an either/or? How about increasing aid to the homeless while actually prosecuting and incarcerating those who do commit violent offenses, even misdemeanors? I don't understand how an article like this can be written without even acknowledging that violent misdemeanors can actually be pretty violent, and deserve no prison time at all according to the Manhattan DA."

>	“Is it going to help you to lock people up after you’re dead?” Ms. Won said.

What a callous thing to say about murdered Asian women and our community. Would she say this toward any other group?

And the answer is yes, it would help. From a preventative standpoint so they never murder another Asian woman again, and from a justice standpoint because believe it or not Asians are human beings deserving of justice too. In fact, if most of these racist, misogynist men had been locked up like they should have been because of their priors, these Asian women (Michelle Go, Christina Lee, etc.) would still be alive. 

""Policing is not the answer."" Ok, does Ms. Won want me to call her when I'm getting attacked? Would she like to give out her number? Will she even show up? Of course the American cj system has serious problems. Why is it up to Asians who are being brutalized to both fix and reject it when we didn’t cause these issues and these demands are never directed at any other group? Why do these individuals who have strange, inhumane ideas about Asian people get so much visibility in politics and media like the Times to represent our community? It's like those in power enjoy provoking internecine conflict by elevating these people. Meanwhile the victims are never humanized and we are never given a platform to express our outrage and urgency."

Historically, the West has used this myth to pit POC against each other and it's showing before our very eyes. Now Asians are being forced to defend their position as POC from other POC communities while also fending off the racism of white supremacy.

They are ignoring the fact that their so-called ""yellow privilege"" is a result of a minority of rich, international students having their home and education paid for by their parents overseas. They are ignoring the negative effect this is having on Southeast Asians, South Asians, Central Asians, and lower-middle class East Asians living in the West who must work so much harder to get into these universities. They are ignoring the fact that Affirmative Action isn't about reducing numbers, it's about curbing the influence of white supremacy.

Add to that the intense hatred that comes from no longer being worshiped on the pedestal they've been used to for well over a hundred years- minorities being their equals, much of the world being (at least on paper) decolonized, no longer having all the privileges of apartheid-level systems- economic, legislative, or otherwise, to give them a decent living just off the merit of their race, and it no longer being acceptable for them to spew racist shit in the open- yeah, they're bitter."

17,kbuz2m,"[The PDF is available in its entirety here.](https://gofile.io/d/GYnY4n) The headline definition is questionable - there is no U.S. law to my knowledge that privileges East Asians over other minority groups... and in fact, the Chinese Exclusion Act is the only time an ethnic group was singled out from immigrating. The only supporting evidence given is a single anecdote where a Chinese American guy leverages the model minority stereotype to get treated as white by the jury. Individual stories can be cherrypicked; what does the statistical data say about sentencing fairness? 

The pamphlet suffers severely from trying to translate academic theory into a public service announcement. All the complexity, nuance, and disclaimers are completely erased and the main thrust will be misinterpreted by anybody not already familiar with Asian minority issues. There is such a thing as dumbing down things too much and whoever wrote it needs to be enrolled in a public communications course. Given the press, I expect that this pamphlet, however well-intended, has probably done more harm than good. 

I also think it's deeply unhelpful to split people into oppressors/oppressed - what needs to be combated is the oppressive idea/narrative, which most people internalize unconsciously. The moment you point at somebody and label them an oppressor, they get defensive and are no longer receptive to listening. 

Tangentially, there's a certain strain of performatively woke politics that I find myself contemptuous of - it's manifested by the [spectacle of politicians kneeling in Kente cloth in support of BLM](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/shannonkeating/democrats-kente-cloth-pelosi-cuomo-bowser-black-lives-matter) (which they should support!)... without enacting any actual change. In this context, Asians play the role of Schrodinger's Minority: simultaneously privileged enough to not merit any special considerations but also expected to *reflexively* fall in line with their politics as a show of solidarity, regardless of any self-interest. Where conservative Republicans use model minorities as a smokescreen their racism and stalking horse for white privilege, neoliberal Democrats use it as an excuse to silence protests when they sacrifice the interests of AsAms for the other larger voting blocs. It's two sides of the same coin where we are just used as props to be picked up and dropped when convenient."

19,kbuz2m,"Honestly, the only problem I really see with the ""Yellow Privilege"" pamphlet is the title itself. Us East Asians do have to contend with the model minority myth in that it both helps us by giving us societal advantages over black and brown people, and hurts us by making those advantages applicable to us at the discretion of general white attitudes towards us. 

Right now, the narrative of ""the China Virus"" has brought general sentiment against East Asians to a level where we're ""dirty foreigners."" Once coronavirus blows over, though, we as East Asians have to make sure we stand in solidarity with our black, brown, queer and working-class brethren, instead of sucking up to white people in an attempt to assimilate. The ""Yellow Privilege"" thing is real, but it's no ""privilege"" when our status of whiteness depends on whether the dominant group decides it's expedient or not."

0,99yo4c,"This reminds me of what [John Cho](http://www.vulture.com/2016/07/john-cho-star-trek-beyond-c-v-r.html) said about ""what's wrong with film representation"", and how some of it is ""mechanical"", it's lighting, makeup and costume. 

>I've seen many instances where we’re seen as a little less than human, or maybe a little more than human — like ultrahuman, rather than subhuman. What is wrong with film representation? Some of it is mechanical, surprisingly. I've thought about why Asian stars — from Asia, I mean — look so much better in their Asian films than they do in their American films, and now I can answer that to some extent. There's an eye, and it's not a malicious eye, which is a way that the people working the camera and behind the scenes view us. And then they process it and they put it on film. And it's not quite human. Whereas Asian films, they are considered fully human. Fully heroic, fully comic, fully lovely, fully sad, whatever it is. And it's this combination of lighting, makeup, and costume.  
>  
>If you don't think of a person as fully human, you sort of stop short and go, *That’s good enough*. Do you remember Doug Liman’s film *Go*? I remember Taye Diggs in that movie, and he was charcoal black. I was surprised to see him in *How Stella Got Her Groove Back* — I realized that *Go* was not an accurate representation of his skin tone whatsoever. And I've met him. He was carelessly lit. Why is that? Why is one carelessly lit? The white people were carefully lit.

There were moments in CRA that takes me back to that interview, moments where Asian men and women aren't just ""carefully lit"", but they are lit like movie stars, as if the sun shines differently on them. We see this a lot with white people, but rarely ever POC, unless it's in a POC-led production like CRA or Black Panther. That scene where Nick and Colin are shirtless (thank you, Jon Chu, because Chris Pang is *ripped*), talking about Nick's plan to propose to Rachel, for one. The scene where Rachel meets Nick by the water, towards the end of the movie, where Constance is lit like the goddamn movie star that she is. And then finally, the shower scene mentioned in this article, where Astrid's husband Michael is lit and framed like a sex symbol. 

CRA isn't just significant because it stars an all-Asian cast; it's significant because of the way Asian people are lit, framed, costumed, and made up. I almost cried when I saw Constance Wu in ""movie star lighting"". It's not just enough to cast beautiful and fit Asian actors and actresses; they have to be seen as movie stars, as sex symbols, and most importantly, as humans."

Then a new VP came in - also a white woman - and she stopped the whole process. The company stonewalled me for 6 weeks. At some point I realized that they weren’t even going to let me interview. Finally, the VP sat me down and said she was just afraid that I “wasn’t strong enough yet” and that “I would be steamrolled” by my employees (even though I was already a successful manager).

They hired an external candidate to be my boss - a white man - and I helped train him. Throughout the process, the VP kept making comments like, “This is why I hired a man!” whenever my new boss did something that... definitely didn’t require a man to do (e.g., filling holes in walls).

It’s been a couple years. I’m still with the company. They pay me well, even at my level, and I genuinely like my new boss. But when he tells me that I'm his best employee, and that I would replace him if he gets promoted... I can’t help but feel a little bitter. 

If I were a white man, or even a white woman, I think it would have already happened back in 2018.

1,iq3co6,"This is a really great article that addresses the double standards and stereotypes Asian women face due to the intersectionality of their identity. Asian women being viewed as subservient is one of the most harmful generalizations we face and leads to everything from being expected to work more for less to gross feteshization by Western men. I think this article did a good job in talking about how these issues affect women from all parts of Asia and how when minorities defy the expectations of the majority, they can quickly be branded as a threat.

Thanks for sharing, unkle!"
2,iq3co6,"My problem is I’m not docile enough. I think whites people are so uncomfortable with any woman who doesn’t fit the description of a traditional, easy going white woman. So any time I voice an opinion assertively without a smile or fake small talk it’s seen as too assertive. Everything is about a level of politeness and white “etiquette” that simply doesn’t in exist in asian cultures. Add on top of that being raised without being encouraged to communicate my thoughts and feelings about anything, and I come off too hard for some people when expressing certain opinions. I’ve been seeing a therapist and reading different books to look at myself in general but I still struggle with how to get ahead without coming off as a bitch."
3,iq3co6,"This article is so true. Too many Asian women have been in situations where we had to excel just to receive the same respect our white, male coworkers are given right off the bat. Incredibly frustrating as well, because if we speak about this discrepancy we need solid evidence or we’re obviously mistaken. As if we can’t be trusted to understand our own lived experiences."
4,iq3co6,"The ""Asian docility myth"" has its reasons, tbh. We get seen as unreasonable/the problem/etc if we speak up, we're expected to inconvenience ourselves so that others don't have to have the smallest bit of inconvenience.

That's what the docility myth is ultimately. Kinda pissed atm because got out of a house meeting that was literally this same thing, so partially venting- but white people get to cry about even the smallest actions of decency when asked, and men get to whine about the same thing."
5,iq3co6,"This is still true when Western companies do business in Asia. When they need a secondary Asian executive because the white male exec doesn't understand the market/regulation, they almost always hire an Asian women. I've literally never sees a white female, asian male exec pairing by a Western company conducting business in Asia ever."

0,igqe0h,"Soon after the coronavirus lockdown hit, some peculiar posts appeared on the New York City forum of Reddit, a popular discussion site. A user calling himself “meat boy” was offering crazy low prices on cuts ranging from drum sticks to pig lips at an obscure Chinatown butcher shop.

“Let your poor and broke ass friends know that they don’t need to starve in times like this,” he wrote.

The missives, which offered even steeper discounts to folks in need, were long, funny and rude. There were 26 F-bombs in one post alone.

They garnered thousands of likes and hundreds of comments on the usually curmudgeonly forum.

“Heart of NY right there,” was a typical response.

“Meat boy,” I learned when I called, is Jefferson Li, a 28-year-old military man who works at the butcher shop with his parents. His folks immigrated in 1985 from China’s Guangdong province and speak little English.

Mr. Li said he hoped to lure new customers to the struggling store, which caters largely to Chinese immigrants.

His dad worked long days at the shop for decades and drove a taxi at night. “I can’t stand to see all that effort go down the drain,” he said.

He’s no slacker himself. He has been “volunteering” at the shop since he was five, working the register and hauling boxes.

“I didn’t realize it wasn’t normal until I went to middle school,” he says of his first experience meeting middle-class kids.

He enlisted in the Coast Guard, attended Hunter College and supported himself with jobs ranging from a stint at J. Crew to a logistics gig. But he never stopped helping at his parents’ shop.

Sometimes he served double duty: When Superstorm Sandy destroyed $750,000 of inventory in 2012, he wrangled grants and loans to save the business. In a landlord dispute, he saved attorney costs by researching cases and records.

It took him nine years to earn his college degree.

“The family legacy was more important than my studies,” he says.

Upon graduating last year, he finally struck out on his own, accepting a five-month assignment in Seattle with the Coast Guard’s Maritime Force Protection Unit.

“It was the best vacation I ever had,” he said.

He returned to New York planning to take another long assignment with the Coast Guard. Then the pandemic hit.

Mr. Li didn’t want his parents exposed to the virus at the store. Yes, he’s back to 80-hour weeks at the shop.

He isn’t unusual, says Yin Kong, director and co-founder of Think!Chinatown, a nonprofit civic group. Chinatown was disproportionately hit by the pandemic, and many who grew up working for their parents have returned to help.

The older generation, meanwhile, is starting to adopt their children’s suggestions. “They are more willing to try new things, like go online,” she says.

Mr. Li said he is putting his own stamp on the store for the first time, starting with the Reddit posts. But when we spoke on the phone, he admitted he still hadn’t told his parents what he had done, afraid of their reaction.

Last week, I visited the shop, 47 Division Street Trading Inc. A faded 2012 dragon calendar hung in the window. Inside the narrow store, sausages hung from a ceiling pipe and whole ducks sat in bins atop milk crates. The frozen meats were displayed in a repurposed Good Humor ice cream case.

There were only a few signs in English, another effort by Mr. Li to update: “Duck Feet $1.59 a pound.” “Pig trotters $1.49 a pound.”

Mr. Li was waiting on a young man who was clearly not a local.

“I saw the Reddit post!” said the customer, Alec Feretti, who had biked down from Murray Hill. He was buying a pork shoulder, a duck and a black chicken.

He loved the prices. “Maybe I’ll come back and work my way up to pig lips,” he said.

Mr. Li told me that the night before, he finally told his parents about the posts.

I spoke to his father, Peter Li, through a translator.

“I’ve noticed at least five or six people who are clearly not from here every day,” he said. “I’m really appreciative that after he put it on the internet, people see it and are coming.”

His son took me upstairs to the office, with its plywood floors and metal file cabinets.

“It’s as janky as s—!” Mr. Li grinned. “The atmosphere is definitely 1980s hardcore Chinese immigrant.”

He looked embarrassed and proud at the same time.

He pulled up a website from a fancy butcher shop in Australia. “I’d love to be like this while retaining our own personal characteristics,” he said. “For us, it’d have a more Chinese heritage and style to it.”

Does that mean he’s planning to stick around?

He sighed. He has passed up good opportunities to join friends launching businesses, he said. And he sometimes feels stagnant compared with his pals who went into investment banking. “They’re wearing Thomas Pink shirts at $100 a pop,” he said.

“But when my parents came here, it wasn’t about them, it was about us,” he said of himself and his older sister. “It’s only fair for us to keep that in mind.”

I told Mr. Li how great it was to meet someone with such an unusual perspective. He looked mystified.

“I’m a regular Chinatown kid who just grinds, and that’s it. What so special about it?” he said. “We’re a dime a dozen.”"

Take Malaysian cuisine: nobody was mixing Chinese and Indian dishes together because they wanted to “fix” them, it just tastes really good.

* **""Why aren't you speaking up about \*insert political issue here\*?""** In particular, I'm thinking of all the comments under videos of Chinese creators showing off a skill or positive aspect about their lives and then having commenters bring up Uyghur concentration camps and other issues.

Literally anyone who tries to bring up age of consent or attempting to frame conversations about media sexualizing children as some kind of xenophobia or saying ""stop doing this, Japan"" as if Japan is just...inherently predatory has all kinds of bullshit to unpack.

Aside from the fact that there's basically a desert of language/words used to describe the different types and ranges of ""folds"" of the (east) asian eye shape and everything gets swept under ""mono-lid"" vs ""double-lid""

There are actual physical/medical aspects about certain monolid eye shapes that surgery sometimes IS a quality-of-life improving procedure. (i forgot what it's called but one thing is sometimes the lid will droop with age enough that it will start to obstruct vision, or sometimes there's this involuntary twitching in the eyelid muscles that's only on one side) These conditions are rare obviously but they are more prevalent in monolid ppl. 

Whenever people assume (east) asians get eyelid surgery to look white it's just so ignorant and abrasive. 

Also even if someone is getting it for aesthetic reasons, going from a 内双 (inner fold) to 扇形双 (thin double-lid that's fan-shaped) does not equal wanting to look white or even have anything to do with Eurocentric beauty standards because the latter eye shape as been hashtag aesthetic since ancient times."

I spoke in english with an N95, pair of goggles and a a surgical mask on.

Edit: I just unearthed another two traumatic memories
This isn't so much related to anti-Asian sentiment but to me it intersects since it's so closely tied to being southeast asian and islamic anyway so I'll share.

I knew one super sensitive resident with full cognitive capacity and who was pretty able bodied and able minded, healthy except for an injury he had and has since recovered from. He was a serious writer and let me know about his book and wherein one part of it included the ""invasion of the (rich side of the island we live on here) by saudi arabian women in burkas"". 

And another res who once pleaded and screamed at me to move her wheelchair to the bathroom (which I'm not allowed to do) who started to go rambling off tangent about Islamic killers at airports



I'm muslim. 

I won't express this at work, obviously, but these people are so entitled and live in such weird ivory-white-fragility-conspiracy towers they've constructed that it takes ALL of my strength to not say ""Ma'am, this is a Wendy's (environment of care and mutual respect)"".

And this ain't even going into the nasty ass comments I hear against the black professionals as well, with some residents going as far as suggesting that Ethiopian aides shouldn't be allowed to speak in their language to each other when around a resident while also using the word ""uncivilized"" in the same sentence. 


Actually you know what, fuck it. I live on Long Island. There, now you know how awful this was."
1,n6jweq,"I also work in a skilled nursing facility. One pt who had a bad bout of Covid and was still recovering, showed me a picturebook of his farm in WV. Once I saw the MAGA hat and Trump flag I knew. In a later session he told me he fought in the Korean War and that he knew me and my people better than we know ourselves. THEN he had the caucasity to tell me he knew how to kill me. I left the room immediately and reported it to the administrator. I’m not working with that bull shit. He got Covid cause he’s a dumb, old, selfish, racist and sexist fuck."

Despite the fact that I have lived here my whole life and have a Midwestern American accent. Only thing I can surmise is that his hearing is gone and he relied on reading lips, which he now can’t do because of mask wearing, so he assumed I had an accent. Thankfully for better or worse what I’ve received hasn’t been that bad. During the middle of the Middle East conflict my brown/ middle eastern colleagues got much worse."

0,j52ppc,"Meanwhile, in August 2018, Tran explained why she quit social media in a powerful essay she wrote for The New York Times.

""It wasn't their words, it's that I started to believe them,"" she shared at the time regarding the online hate she received. ""And those words awakened something deep inside me -- a feeling I thought I had grown out of. The same feeling I had when at 9, I stopped speaking Vietnamese altogether because I was tired of hearing other kids mock me.""

""Their words reinforced a narrative I had heard my whole life: that I was 'other,' that I didn't belong, that I wasn't good enough, simply because I wasn't like them,"" she continued. ""And that feeling, I realize now, was, and is, shame, a shame for the things that made me different, a shame for the culture from which I came from. And to me, the most disappointing thing was that I felt it at all. Because the same society that taught some people they were heroes, saviors, inheritors of the Manifest Destiny ideal, taught me I existed only in the background of their stories, doing their nails, diagnosing their illnesses, supporting their love interests -- and perhaps the most damaging -- waiting for them to rescue me."""
1,j52ppc,"She seems like a wonderful person, and didn’t deserve any of the shit she got. Is it okay to be pissed off about how shitty Star Wars became? Yeah- I am too. But to target an actress and say racist things to her . . ."

3,j52ppc,"Honestly, when she was cast into the Star Wars franchise I was really excited to see her in the films because she was Asian and I had never really liked Star Wars before so this gave me a reason to watch. It was so sad how they downplayed her character and then how fans were so mean to her. I hope she gets a chance to work on other future projects that are non-Star Wars related."
4,j52ppc,I should watch Monsterland.
5,j52ppc,I really liked her character a lot and it sucked that she was sidelined. But even more so I just like Kelly and I hate how she was disrespected. She deserves so much better and I’m glad she’s finally getting to breathe on other projects.
6,j52ppc,She looks happier/healthier in this interview than in her Star Wars promo photos. Didn't care for The Force Awakens so I boycotted the rest of the Star Wars reboot trilogy (although I'm tempted to watch the other 2 movies now for the sake of rEpReSeNtAtIoN *cough* John Boyega *cough* Kelly Marie Tran). Looking forward to Raya when it comes out!
7,j52ppc,"So it was American society and conforming to unrealistic standards that truly affected her, and the small amount of people saying nasty things only reinforced those standards she had endured through her whole life as an asian american. I can't imagine what it's like having to give up your name; but my Grandfather went through a similar experience and his name was shortened when he came East so it would be easier to pronounce. I don't know personally how it must feel but I can imagine how must it must hurt to sacrifice your culture in order to appease society."
8,j52ppc,"Even though I didn't really like her character, I didn't think it was the actresses fault (I mean even if it was she still doesn't deserve hate). The Star Wars sequel had so many inconsistencies and poorly written characters so her character wasn't the only one that was bad imo (Finn's character development was non existent and bland). So I feel like she was just used as a scape goat..."

He needs to get his facts right on who's subsidizing who. You think all these state schools go out of their way to recruit students from China out of largesse. Gimme a fuckin' break.

No, American college tuition is completely overinflated, and many intl students pay the whole sticker price to subsidize other students and the ever increasing ranks of do-nothing admin at these places. He says that the parents of Chinese students are trying to ""replace us,"" as in whites. Again with the ""great replacement"" conspiracy theory, one of the favorite racist BS lies of the right, pointed at whichever group is their target or they feel threatened by. That, and a sprinkling of modified ""anchor baby"" racism.

Asian students in academia from undergrad on up are already plagued with so much racist sh*t. From admissions officers and professors believing Asians don't have creativity or personality, to constant racist scrutiny with regards to cheating/spying, American universities are becoming increasingly hostile places for Asian students and academics (AsAm and intl). Even in the academy racism against Asians persists, and trust me, people do not care what ""kind"" of Asian you are.

21,ftn60u,"TBH, I think Carlson brings up a good point but he's wrong when he says this is at a net loss. At least in the UC system in California, out-of-state students are pretty much the only demographic that is actually economically profitable for universities to take on (in-state tuition is a net operating loss for universities), and a large portion of these students comes from China. 

Optimistically, I do think that US institutions will forever be better than Chinese counterparts for valuing freedom of speech, expression, and academic exploration without some sort of overhanging state agenda. My hope is that students that come to the US can recognize and appreciate these cultural differences whether they decide to stay in the states or go back overseas."
0,del8zm,"Just some meandering thoughts I've pulled together from years of readings and observations...

As I write this, the three top posts in /r/worldnews are two posts about South Park in China and one post about blindfolded prisoners in Xinjiang. These are truly the most important issues of our times - Reddit hivemind curating your content at work. 

No, Reddit isn't the news, but a same curation process happens behind the scenes in every news organization. I encourage you to think critically. By this, I don't mean a myopic focus on accurate reporting of facts (although this too is important and often in question when it comes to China) or even mere crude censorship, but the meta-news. Who decided something was newsworthy? Who decided something was **not**? What was left out? How important is it really in relation to everything else going on? Why are you hearing about this now? Who is the source of the claims? Who's connecting disparate stories to form the official narrative? Better yet, who's putting out the stories **for you to ""naturally"" arrive at the narrative** they're trying to sell? 

So as an example, let's take the current Hong Kong protests. Without taking any sides, let me just point out that during this time, the Gilets Jaunes protests in France have continued (with fatalities and maimings from the police suppression), Kashmir has had telecommunications cut, been put under virtual martial law, and seen thousands of preemptive arrests, Indonesia has had protests (again, with multiple fatalities from police shooting live ammunition), and over a hundred protestors have been killed in Iraq. The popularity of these protests might not match HK, but I hope you'll agree with me that comparatively the police response in HK has been restrained, as evidenced by, you know, protestors (at least so far) not getting killed by police. So why is it that the response to the HK protests have drawn so much condemnation and the other protests barely merit a mention? 

You are living in a world awash with information and even without resorting to lying, facts can be cherrypicked to support just about any narrative. There are whole knowledge-creation industries, such as lobbyists and think tanks, out there to convince people to believe things that align with the interests of whoever funds them. You are targets for influence campaigns to manipulate your sentiments, beliefs, and actions - and I don't mean just the Russians or Chinese or Iranians or whoever the enemy of the week is, but *everybody*. That especially includes the largest Military-Industrial Complex in the world. Organizations that run these campaigns aren't interested in informing you or encouraging public debate. They do strategic messaging - this means they put out whatever is necessary to achieve their desired strategic effects. Things like consolidation of national broadcasters, dying local news, social media, big data/AI will only make things worse. These are the times you live in. 

Not too long ago in historical terms, people used Christianity or Civilization to justify the rape, slaughter, slavery, and pillage of other peoples. Eventually, Freedom and Democracy became the justification for foreign intervention. Then it was Human Rights. And these excuses will continually morph to whatever is necessary to get your support. Watch this space - personally, I wouldn't be surprised to see Global Climate Change/Saving the Planet as the next big justification. Feminism/LGBT is already in vogue. I'm not saying that these causes are not good causes - what I'm saying is that actors will try to hijack your views on these causes to advance their own interests, just like how corporations do Pride Week to improve their image and sales."
1,del8zm,"I've been worried about this and the oncoming yellow peril that seems to be happening. It's so mentally draining and exhausting to see the constant  anti-Chinese posts on Reddit (not supporting the CCP here but a lot of posts are thinly veiled racist comments).

It's making me feel ashamed of being Chinese because all of this just brings back the constant racist comments I got growing up."
2,del8zm,"It's a losing battle, mate. As someone who's lived on both sides of the Pacific, I've pretty much resigned myself to the inevitable conflict between Chinese and Western cultures.

Western media and public discourse LOVE to shit on China, because it generates outrage and clicks. It's pretty much impossible to combat and fact check, for two reasons:

1) Most of the stories are at least rooted in some semblance of the truth, for example, YES there are camps in Xinjiang where Uyghurs are being sent against their will, and YES the organs of executed criminals were indeed used for transplants in the early 2000's.

2) As another redditor on this sub pointed out, there are ZERO repercussions for any Western media outlet that takes negative stories about China and blows them way out of proportion. The group of people who can both read the story and are knowledgeable enough to refute it forms such a tiny audience that their voices will immediately be drowned out by those calling for blood.


I really wish things weren't this way.

EDIT: fixed a typo"
3,del8zm,"People in this thread keeps say whataboutism or what not, but really what bothers me is that a pro-China opinon is not allowed in the US and West on anything.

For all of the west's domestic and international issues (BLM, France yellow vests, multiple wars of terror and associated civilian deaths, US border camps), regardless of what people supporter, we at least accept that there can be multiple perspectives on the cause and reasoning behind what government / non- government groups motivation for doing things. 

With China there isn't, anyone who is anti government is automatically good, and anyone who supports government is automatically brainwashed. And the media only represents the anti government view. 

Take Hong Kong protests for example, no one questions whether they are protesting for right or justified reasons (""anti China = freedom = good""), when it started due to an new extradition law (now canceled) with Taiwan to extradite a murderer (China was one the countries that the new extradition agreement included, and people claimed that would allow political enemies to be extradited but the law spelled out clear criteria where extradition is valid)."
4,del8zm,"Thank you for putting it in words. When I see the basically 24/7 coverage of the Hong Kong protests even on my local news stations, I feel so irritated that American protests (BLM, union strikes) have way less news time, detail, and sympathy tbh. My parents and I are Chinese diaspora, so I'm trying hard to reconnect and understand China without a Western, anti-socialist bias. (It doesn't help that I didn't grow up hearing/speaking Chinese, but at least I'm starting to learn as an adult.)"
5,del8zm,"China is pretty bad right now. But it's pretty alarming that the mission du jour for American media these days is to prop up their atrocities to distract and or justify the same issues america is facing.

6,del8zm,"They probably haven't developed a sudden outrage at the maltreatment of Uyghur Chinese people. They're probably more concerned about China getting richer and more powerful than the US. In their worldview, it's more important that the US stays as the most powerful country, and people in ""evil China"" escaping poverty is wrong because they're Chinese.

Also, the US wasn't just being imperialistic 100 years ago. Just look at what happened in Vietnam, or all of its political interference and  support of right wing coups in Latin America."

For most of us here, we live in America and we have the right to vote in this country, but there's not enough happening to make the necessary changes that this country needs. Americans are not actually as critical of America as like they to believe. Even groups like Asian Americans, I find the level of criticism towards America as a country is incredibly weak. 

This country shouldn't even exist in the first place because it's built on stolen land but Americans still have all the energy in the world to focus so much of their hatred on China, it's ridiculous. We're imprisoning people for profit, we're sanctioning the living fuck of countries, we've gone to war slaughtering the hell out of other Asians, but nobody really wants to talk about that because they don't actually have a problem with human rights abuses."
9,del8zm,"Here's a quote from Singaporean diplomat Kishore Mahbubani in the video, [America's Fundamental Misunderstanding of China](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojr-tqaQQOQ):

*One of the questions that future historians will be very puzzled by is the judgments made by America on China.  And I tell you why they be puzzled, the United States of America is about 240 years old. Chinese history is maybe 2400 years old. In today's world, you have a society which is 240 years old passing judgment on a society which is 2400 years old.  And at a time when China has had its best 30 years of history, the Americans are telling Chinese you guys are not doing very well.

...those ppl definitely care more about circle jerking the Anti-China train station than actual wellbeing of HongKong protestors."
19,del8zm,"Tbh, I wonder whether this is just another wave of the Western propaganda train.  Just like how Tiananmen was such a “big deal” because the West somehow believed that a few hundred peaceful demonstrators were going to topple a government that was borne from over a century of bloody revolutions (iirc China was having revolutions every 10-20 years prior to the Communist revolution).   Naive and absurd.  Now the focus is on Hong Kong.

Meanwhile, a more serious protest is going on in Iraq, a country in which the US has had a direct hand in shaping following the war.  After 16 years, it still suffers from deep corruption and rising unemployment from terrible management.  Over 100 people have died, and there are government sponsored snipers shooting the protesters.  This despite the Iraq’s immense oil reserves that it has failed to utilize to bring prosperity.

This is 100% a political game, and of course it’s easier for a comfortable armchair redditor to understand Blizzard gaming over unemployment and a volatile, unstable governing society."

HKers, Tibetans, and Uighurs are all also Asian, yet all I see is “poor oppressed China” posts.

The abuses at Abu Gharib became public and the perpetrators were punished. Why is it that China only arrests the human rights defenders and not the abusers??? “America is just as bad” my ass.

There is documentary evidence of China harvesting organs of political dissidents. “Difficult to rate oppression” my ass.

Yes, I'm sure she does know. She also probably didn't assume you would take such a comment about China as a personal attack. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

I mean... Yeah. We (Americans) kinda find it hard to criticize ourselves; but also- please note that animosity between China and America has kinda always been a thing. The comparison of Chinese government to US government is legit communism to democracy. 

You have to understand, the idea that ""China is somehow so much more evil""- has substance in modern America. Both sides are fucked up; and contextually China is a whole other beast- but you can at least understand the opposing perspective right? They are fucked. Nobody is saying that America isn't fucked in their own right- but we are blessed with freedoms that justify such a statement.

Actually triggered over a mere one-off comment."
26,del8zm,Is it okay to hate all superpower nations equally?
27,del8zm,"It's funny how when China is being shit on, people start to swing this into an AA issue. Where's the uproar when North Korea does some stupid shit and it's all over the news? Maybe it's time to check your biases.

As a Korean American, I'd disagree that the anti-Chinese rhetoric is fueling more AA racism in the west. It's the morons that make it an us versus them scenario that makes it worse for the rest of us."
28,del8zm,"Chinese news is probably equally anti-America. 

And for what it’s worth, there are pockets of ignorance no matter where you go. That’s just life. 

Anecdotally, my white friends and peers criticize the US more than any other country. But I also happen to live in a very progressive city and with at a pretty progressive company."
29,del8zm,"The main things I hear that make people worry about China are regarding censorship, mass government surveillance, the idea of the “social credit system”, sweatshops and poor work conditions for the disadvantaged, and corporate espionage and theft.

Those aren’t really things you can directly compare against as being big problems in the modern United States. Nevertheless, most US citizens I know hardly ignore some of the messed up things that still occur around home.

That said, you refer to China as your country. Are you a Chinese citizen or a US citizen, or neither maybe? Because China, last I heard, does not recognize dual nationalities.  While if you are a Chinese National I can understand your viewpoint, if you are not I don’t understand your loyalty to, or annoyance on behalf of, the Chinese government."
30,del8zm,">(nobody talks about Abu Gharib)

Are you kidding me? Ask any American adult over, say, 30 and chances are they'll recognize the Abu Gharib pictures. We barely even have pictures of the shit going on to the Uyghurs because of how utterly repressive the regime is.

>I wish that some of my white peers would care as much about American dystopia (which they can more easily address, as voters) as they did Eastern dystopia.

Are you just talking to Trump supporters or something? Unless they are it's possible to care about both.

>It's like, America has already done the same thing 100 years ago yet China is somehow so much more evil.

Yeah China's pure fucking evil and so is the US. Again, possible to hate both. And whining about the US when people are talking about the repression in Hong Kong or the cultural genocide against the Uyghurs just makes you look like a damn fool, just as people whining about China when people are talking about police shootings in the US or the Iraq war would make them the fool."

33,del8zm,"This seems like a good place to chime in.

We like to think that everyone here have the right to Life, Liberty, and Pursuit of Happiness, while in China every kids are working in sweatshop and the Big Brother is real and at large.

News flash:  America is just the same way.

We do not have true freedom; we have the **ILLUSION ** of freedom.  Sure Jimmy, you can grow up and be whatever you want to be, but there will be career paths that make absolutely no sense (like getting a liberal art degree on ~50k loan that last min. 20 years, or working 60+ hrs week just to make ends meet.) ""But Capt, we can at least vote/choose leaders and legislation that govern us, unlike those commies!"" Laws aren't made for you and I, they are made for Corp by lobbyists.  Even in the most nable of bill proposed there will be someone getting paid.  As for leaders, just look at how the POTUS won last election..

What about the labor of minor?  Nowaday kids are all Honor/AP classes so that they can get into competitive colleges, where they will inccur a debt that will follow them for AT LEAST 20 years.  In essence, the average child will need to be working from 12 yrs old til 42 to be freed from financial burdens.  That is also assuming there will be no setbacks and the bachelor degree obtained is enough to get a steady, well-paid job, which will not happen.

I'm not saying communism is better than democratic capitalism.  I'm simply just posing the question:

Are we really that much different than China?"
34,del8zm,"America isn't nearly as bad. We don't systematically kill our own citizens, we don't imprison our people and harvest organs, our populus is sophisticated enough not to eat human featuses thinking it creates ""health benefits"", we don't elect leaders that create famines so bad millions upon millions don't starve to death, we dont engage in slavery, and we don't deny our citizens basic rights because they speak out against the government. 

America isn't perfect. There's a lot of negative things in our history but it's gotten a million times better. China has gotten worse. It's failed to act in the best interest of it's citizens, it's failed to be a healthy member of global society and it's failed to do the right thing."

37,del8zm,"My thoughts here, and probably an unpopular opinion:

The reason why it’s so easy to be anti-Chinese, is because there’s no precedent for democracy or freedom in Chinese history. Culturally, China has been a top-down society that crushed any appeal for democracy (i.e. Tiananmen Square). Let’s not forget that China imprisons, tortures, and murders its own people for painting China in unflattering ways.

At least with America, there’s a pretense for freedom and civil liberties. I know hasn’t had the best track record for upholding those ideals. But in those tough times, America has shone through.

Maybe if China changed a little bit in the right direction, Americans wouldn’t be so anti-Chinese."
38,del8zm,"China is pretty damn bad at the moment and that's kind of resurfaced with the Hong Kong situation. While America can be pretty bad it isn't even close to the shit China goes around pulling like abducting millions of citizens or disappearing people for being anti government. This is against the Chinese government, not the people. That said I can't really do anything about China and I'm fairly open about what I think should change here at home."

41,del8zm,"Well Americans are usually myopic when it cones to their fucked up misdeeds and evils!!!  Its nit American to just wave the flag and proclaim that you’re proud of your country! A true patriot will always look for the truth no matter what light it puts your country in!

The anti-Chinese government sentiment is just going to fuel the acceptability of anti-East Asian racism. To be blunt, if you think that the anti-Chinese government sentiment won't extend into anti-Chinese and anti-Asian American sentiment, then you're being purposely naive. Racist people aren't smart enough to make the distinction.

Since the 80s in the Bay Area young black men targeted older East Asian women because they realized those women had a very hard time picking out the actual perpetrator in a police line-up. All the black men looked alike to them. The East Asian community then vilified young black men in general. Kept increasing and driving a wedge between the two communities which of course made things even worse with face blindness and being targets and not recognizing the real robbers etc. and generally they just saw each other as “The Others” and not their own neighbors. The only thing that can break down the cycle is more interaction between the two communities but obviously it’s been a long-standing problem, just goes in waves."
4,lden52,"The problem is that Asians in CA, especially the Bay Area, are extremely segregated.

On one hand you have the Asians living in SF and Oakland who have been historically much poorer. They have lower education work primarily in service industries.

Then you have the Asians living on the Peninsula/South Bay/parts of Fremont. These are the extremely well off and highly educated Asians working in tech. They live in million dollar houses and make well over 6 figures. Their children attend extremely rich school districts that are either majority Asian (like 65% Asian and 35% everything else), or an even split of Asian and white. They fight tooth and nail to prevent low income housing from being built, and block BART/CALTrain stations from getting too close to where they live because they might bring in undesirables.

These rich Asians have NEVER encountered discrimination outside of mean online comments and maybe some verbal slurs. As far as they're concerned, the experiences of the poor Asians don't exist and they don't really care about it.

It's the poor Asians who are being primarily targeted.

So on one hand, rich Asians leave a perception that all Asians are rich and worth targeting. Rich Asians don't get attacked, so they don't bother making a fuss and complaining. And worst of all, because they don't get targeted, they think no one else does, so they actively shit on poorer Asians when they try speaking up about their experiences. Or they unhelpfully tell their poorer brethren that they're just not educated enough to see systemic inequalities that are causing their issues.

And I say this as I grew up in one of those rich Asian enclave as a former poor Asian. It's wild seeing my classmates who grew up in 1.4 million dollar houses, attend an Ivy League/Cal/Stanford and graduate debt free straight into a 250k job helped by their dad securing them an internship at Intel during their undergraduate years, turn around and claim they speak for all Asians on social media. 

Like shut your over-privileged trap. You were born with a golden spoon and have never been poor in your whole damn life or lived in a poor neighborhood with gangs and crime.

But it's a self perpetuating cycle because only the rich Asians can enter certain industries because they have a rich family back them up. They go into politics and end up representing the interest of their fellow rich Asians. They end up working as journalists for the NYT or other prestigious journalist companies where they write about their privileged experiences. They end up as social media influencers where again, they're biased by their own upbringing and think their sheltered life is representative of all Asians."
5,lden52,"Lots of African-Americans tend to see us as privileged and non-POC. White people still see Asians as POC, and discriminate against us from that. It's the worst of both worlds."
6,lden52,"I mean I feel like you really have to make black people understand that 1) we’re not the enemy 2) we don’t think we’re white 3) we experience racism too. And idk how to do that tbh

They (the movement) want support for their issues but don’t really think about other minority issues imo I’ve heard “I’m supporting black issues because I’m black” which ofc makes sense but then I’ll also hear “why should I focus on you??”"
7,lden52,"Black on Asian crime is not new in San Francisco but there does seem to be an uptick in the recent weeks. I suspect this comes from a number of factors. 

Firstly, the fear of Covid spreading led to an increase of people being released from prison and a clearing out of jails. Those folks have to go somewhere and make a living somehow even through violent means. 

Second, the seeking of social justice reform is seeing more repeat offenders being thrown in a catch and release pattern. The man that shoved the elderly Asian in Oakland did the same to two other people on the same day. And I would bet that the offender had been involved with other known crimes. I believe in second chances but not a third, fourth, or 20th chance if the offender has a proven track record of being a threat to society. 

Third, criminals believe Asians, particularly the elderly, are weak targets incapable of fighting back. Immigrant Asians are less likely to go to the police due to language barriers or a have a distrust of police in general. Older Asians also don't trust the banking system thus keep large amounts of cash on hand or at home. This perception makes them a prime target for thieves. 

Lastly, there are socioeconomic dynamics at play in SF. Over the past 10 years, historically black neighborhoods are undergoing gentrification from Asians moving in. This creates tension and resentment as these neighborhoods are the last bastions of affordability in San Francisco. 

I'm not sure what can resolve the tensions between the Black and Asian community as it's been around for as long as I've lived in the city. The difference is the increasingly violent acts and brazenness of crimes committed which is the only reason it makes it onto the mainstream English news. The Chinese news will report all crimes big and small and what you see are the most heinous crimes and the tip of the iceberg."
8,lden52,I don't know but all the articles about the (multiple!) attacks that get posted to the news subreddit are removed by moderators. I wouldn't have known about that situation if I weren't also on this sub.
9,lden52,"Glad this is getting much needed attention. Just my personal opinion but these type of issues are far more alarming compared to the recent stories of Kpop idols found saying the N-word when they were teenagers (see r/kpop, kpoprants, etc)
Not my intention to compare the two situations. It’s just funny that there seems to be more outrage from Kpop fans on stuff that happened years ago while Asians continually get attacked during this current pandemic."
10,lden52,*Weird* how the cops never do the job expected of them when it comes to minority-on-minority crime.
11,lden52,"not sure what leaning into the racial resentment angle is gonna do for us

I don't think the black assailants are uniquely ignorant or bigoted. The same type of white ppl just happen to live in the country where we don't

not sure how we can hold all black ppl accountable for the actions of their worst

invest in public education, social handouts. if these guys had a ps5 they'd be busy doing that lol"
12,lden52,"No one should be discussing “Black on Asian” crime without addressing how white supremacy and white America has been pitting Asians and Black people against each other for the purpose of white gain, nor pointing the finger at Black insult to Asians without acknowledging Asian insult and wrongdoing to Black people. 

There are lots of anti-Black sentiments in here, some covert and some overt, and it is highly disappointing."
13,lden52,Don't call it san fran
14,lden52,"I cannot stress enough how racist this is, and (I'm a new member of this sub) I hope this isn't the normal outlook. 

You said you've seen the data — have you seen how many Asians in San Francisco or Oakland (btw they don't share a Chinatown, they have their own) have been assaulted by Black people, and how that compares to the rest of assaults in those cities? Can you confirm these are, indeed, hate crimes?"
15,lden52,"I'm not sure of the exact answer on how to stop Black vs. Asian violence, but it probably involves the Wu-Tang Clan. 

Jokes aside, I think elderly Asians make good targets because they tend to be wealthier, still carry lots of cash, and won't contact the police because of the language barrier.

While there does seem to be genuine hate crimes happening...such as that elderly man who was murdered recently in the Bay Area, I honestly think most of the petty crime that occurs is based on opportunity due to the reasons listed above rather than some kind of race war."
0,hcfct4,"I also hate when I'm talking about something unrelated to China such as Coronavirus-related hate crimes, and someone brings up, ""but fuck the Chinese government."" Nah bruh, we weren't talking about that, stop trying to low-key justify people getting stabbed."
1,hcfct4,"It's pretty much the same situation with Muslim Americans where we get lumped with ISIS, Al Qaeda, Taliban etc. and have to explain ourselves as if we're a monolith. Individualism really only exists in White America where individuals are solely accountable for their own actions.

Edit: It looks like my comment has been somewhat misinterpreted into me saying that mainland Chinese are comparable to terrorists. Which is not what I was originally intending on saying b/c that's just utterly ridiculous to believe. What I'm trying to point out is the double standard that minorities in general have to deal with where we have to explain ourselves whenever someone else of a similar background does something wrong."
2,hcfct4,"""Why are your people doing this, tell them to stop""

Ah yes, good thing I keep the entirety of the country of China on speed dial. I'll bring up the issue at the weekly zoom meeting that every Chinese person, especially those from in North America, attend regularly. I'm sure if I bring it up and ask nicely, the Chinese government will stop, I'm sure that it's just never crossed their mind."
3,hcfct4,"I agree. Accusing asian AMERICANS of shit that happened in Asia makes about as much sense as saying that some white guy getting sucker punched for no apparent reason ""deserves it"" because of Nazi Germany, or accusing Black americans for what happened in Uganda. Except many consider the former acceptable, and the latter nonsensical. 

I saw alot of my peers' true colors when they all jumped on the whataboutism train talking about all sorts of evils of the CCP as asian americans were getting attacked. Many of them were the  ""progressive"" types too. Being able to finally express your xenophobia and racism under the mask of ""caring about human rights?"" That's every closeted racist's dream come true. Even worse, I've even seen people speaking up against anti asian racism be labeled as ""ccp supporters."" You know it's funny how all of the sudden everybody cares *so much* about the uyghurs and HK, but *somehow* they only bring it up whenever someone mentions anti asian racism. And none of them have actually done anything for the cause, donated anything, etc. Hmm I wonder why... 

I'm really sick of being blamed every time something happens in an Asian country. Just fuckin tell me to go back to China or call me a c---k or something, instead of wasting my time listening to you try to explain how you care so much about human rights violations in China and how being racist to asian americans will supposedly free the uyghurs."
4,hcfct4,"I feel like asians are the new middle eastern in America. Like how muslims has to constantly denounce terrorism. Asians have to denounce whatever is going on in China. White ppl can’t bully muslims anymore cause they basically destroyed the Middle East. Plus because of the constant attacks happening. Ppl aren’t scared of extremists groups like ISIS anymore. America always needs to have an enemy cause it’s easier to unite the American ppl. They did it with the black ppl, Jews, muslims and now Asians."
5,hcfct4,"**I completely agree with this. It’s one of the main reasons why Trump’s relentless insistence on referring to COVID-19 as the “Chinese Virus” is disgusting. People excuse this label, saying “they’ve named a virus after a place before” or “well it came from China.” First off, there are SO MANY practices of the past that we no longer do because we learned they are unethical/ignorant/etc.** So saying that’s how pandemics were titled in the past doesn’t even help the case in my opinion—why would it be okay now that we’re much more societally advanced? 

**Second, people will blame China all they want. However, their hateful words are affecting Chinese/Asian AMERICANS. These hateful posts and crimes are happening to people here in the U.S. and other parts of the world—not China. Trump does not care because his support of Americans is conditional.** He does not care about ALL AMERICANS. How could he when he is racist, homophobic, misogynistic, and a number of other things against many citizens of the U.S.? 

There have been so many hate crimes and many Asian people have been severely injured due to people’s violence and racism. I completely agree with you that people still see us as foreigners. I’m Chinese American and I’ve been told many times to “go back to your country.” 

I’ve also experienced the same thing as you with wanting to just disappear when people talk about the wrongdoings of China. Once, a teacher who disliked me purposely interrupted our math class to discuss how the U.S. needs to stop trading with China because they “are untrustworthy and provide bad products.” I was thirteen and this was only the beginning of uncomfortable conversations about China I sat through being the only poc in the room."
6,hcfct4,"Another thing that should be noted is that even Mainland Chinese are a huge and diverse group - probably even more stratified than Americans.  There's lot of variation depending on region, social class, generation, etc.  A young 20 something Chinese national from Shanghai is not going to be the same as say a 50 year old manual labourer working in Northeast China."
7,hcfct4,"same for any ordinary mainland Chinese. They don't choose their government and they are not responsible for any wrong doings of China and should never be put into shame.

But I think for American, if you voted for the current president (especially he showed early sign of wrong doing before the election, but you still voted for him). Then you are somehow taking a tiny percentage of responsiblity for the presidents and his governments wrong doings during the presidency"
8,hcfct4,Yeah I'm sick of that too. I'm exhausted from being a perpetual foreigner.
9,hcfct4,"As a mainland immigrant, I'm sick n tired of taking such responsibility too.  I bet the Foxnews' and CNNs had you believe that we are all spys for the CCP, and we eat bat soup and Uighurs for breakfast...

As a mainland immigrant, I'm also (and sometimes even more) sick n tired of you other Asians trying to distance from us, pointing fingers at us for any mistreatment received or attacking us for anything from Dalai Lama to Covid as if we're personally responsible.  In doing so, you're desperately becoming the people you accuse.

Bottom line is: we're what we are individually, and racism/xenophobia is solely based on treating people you never met or personally know by how they look or where they come from.  You don't deserve the treatment you get and you're not responsible for what China does.  Guess what?  We mainland immigrants don't deserve and aren't responsible for either!"
10,hcfct4,"I wish I could send this thread to every “progressive” person who uses their anti-CCP stance to excuse racism against Asian Americans and enable xenophobia. Asian Americans don’t support the Uighur camps or control the government’s decisions in any way. To be frank, Chinese citizens have limited say in elections; their control over the government’s decisions is not comparable to the US. I’m tired of people who think they’re woke just fostering Trump’s blatant xenophobia and attempt to shift blame.

Also, I’ve been told to go back to my country a few times. It’s stupid and makes me want to laugh because 1) I’ve been to China only twice and 2) the people yelling at me are not Native American, so they’re just hypocrites."
11,hcfct4,[removed]
12,hcfct4,"I mean...I get your frustration as every BIPOC deals with some form of this in one flavor or another. That said, you’re absolutely entitled to feel frustrated as this is normal to experience as an Asian American living in America. My recommendation would be to limit your social media exposure and definitely try not to read the comments section. That feeling of frustration can get to be dangerously toxic and self consuming so take care of yourself."
13,hcfct4,[removed]
14,hcfct4,"I find it kind of pathetic that EVEN in a post where you are saying that ""we should stand up for our heritage"" you go on to talk sh\*\* about ""mainland Chinese""/China. Instead of trying to differentiate yourself from them, grow some balls. Educate yourself on the country and why they do the things they do. Instead of trying to distance yourself, DEFEND your culture and heritage.

Americans' hatred toward China is not about human rights or intellectual property. It's \*pure\* racism.

Americans aren't gonna ask to see your passport before they start saying racist comments. If you look like it, you are it. You can't reason with ignorant people.

Americans love to say ""I don't hate Chinese people, I just hate their government"". But that's even worse! Chinese people \*support\* their government. It's working well for them. Why should Americans assume they know better what Chinese people need than Chinese people?

Americans simply hate to see that Asians are doing better than them. The first thing you should do is go visit China and actually \*understand\* the place, rather than just buying into the bullshit you see in US media. Then you come back and educate Americans who say stupid bullshit about communism, authoritarianism, etc. These people have been brainwashed since childhood to think that China is bad. You and I have bought into it too. Now it's time to stop letting this shit go on as if it's ok. Don't let people walk all over you and your heritage and just say ""but I was born here"". Learn about your heritage and be PROUD OF IT. Grow some balls and defend yourself and your people."
15,hcfct4,"I agree with this sentiment. The problem is, as you say, that people people treat asian americans as responsible for what other entities do. It's illogical and we should educate them on the difference.

Another issue that I would like to point out works against this. There is a movement among certain asian groups however, that promote the notion of ""you're either with us or against us"". These zealous asian groups refuse to accept that there are people who embrace Chinese (and other asian) people and their culture, while condemning the Chinese government. They often make satirical posts focusing on absolutely racist white people and a attach a mocking caption ""I'm against the government, not the people"". 

It has ingrained on them that criticism on the Chinese government is also a criticism on the Chinese people- Even going as far as pushing the mindset that criticism against the Chinese government is a criticism against all asians. They say ""They can't tell us apart. We asians must unite against the west."" And if you're an asian who disagrees with their viewpont (Or if you're an asian female who dates a white male) they label you as a self-hating asian."

They're always stereotyping, condescending, cold, spend too little time with me, and withhold information they'd give to others. They're even medical directors of these clinics, but their stereotyping and contempt is as severe as anyone else's. They're ok with being directors of these clinics without having any real knowledge or empathy for Asian Americans. And when I complained, the Asian staff didn't do anything but treat me as if I were a troublemaker. I feel Asian staff, both immigrant and US-born, are complicit with the racism of their white bosses, and they chose to hire them because they wanted a white boss - they felt more comfortable with that. 

And I'm not the only once who gets substandard, inequitable treatment in healthcare and elsewhere.

>Over the years, many regions of China have developed their own unique style of mooncake. When it comes to traditional mooncake though, the Cantonese-style is easily the most recognised and ubiquitous. Hailing from Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, it sports a golden-brown crust embossed with decorative patterns on top and filled with lotus seed paste which is sometimes accompanied with one or two salted egg yolks. Other popular fillings are red bean, mung bean, melon seed paste or the more extravagant five-kernel/nuts (五仁 wu ren) option.  
  
>  
>On the other hand, the Shanghai-style typically looks like a small ball with a crumbly, buttery crust for its skin and is commonly filled with lotus seed paste and an egg yolk in the middle. Black/white sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds or almond flakes would be sprinkled on its top.  
  
>  
>Hokkien-style, or nicknamed ""Scholar Cakes"", is regarded as good luck for examination students. During the dynastic period, these mooncakes were prepared as gifts for scholars sitting for the imperial examinations, and the largest cake would be awarded to the top of the cohort. Filled with a mix of candied winter melon, tangerine peel and melon seeds, the mooncake resembles a white disc and is stamped with red Chinese characters such as ""fu"" (福meaning good luck).  
  
>  
>In Yunnan, its most representative style is the Xuanwei ham mooncake (云腿月饼). As this area is renowned for its prized dry-cured ham, it combines this specialty produce with honey and sugar, delivering a signature mooncake that tastes both savoury and sweet. Occasionally, dried rose petals may also be added to enhance the flavour.  
  
>  
>Suzhou, or Su-style (苏式月饼), also offers something for savoury and sweet fans alike. Stuffed with either ground pork or sweet red bean paste, its crisp, flaky pastry is often stamped with edible red ink that writes the name of the bakery.  
  
>  
>In regards to the Beijing-style, one such tale described how Chang'e sent her moon rabbit companion down to earth with a cure after a mysterious plague broke out in the capital. The rabbit presented two medicines, one red and the other white, and these eventually became known as the mooncakes ""Zi Lai Hong"" (自来红) and ""Zi Lai Bai"" (自来白) respectively. The zilaihong in particular has a red circle stamped atop and is stuffed with osmanthus, peach seeds and dried orange peels.  
  
>  
>Chaoshan-style, otherwise known as Teochew mooncakes, can be identified by its flaky alternating, spiral layers and myriad of colours varieties. It is usually filled with sweetened yam, mung bean or red bean paste, with the occasional inclusion of salted egg yolk.Outside non-contemporary styles, Snowskin mooncake is a fan favourite that is less fatty, oily and requires no baking. Originating from Hong Kong, its ""snow skin"" exterior is made using glutinous rice, with a texture similar to Japanese mochi. Unorthodox flavours such as durian, lychee or even alcoholic-infused ones are commercially available and are best served chilled."

https://www.propublica.org/article/hate-endures-in-america-and-with-it-our-effort-to-document-the-damage

tl;dr - it's easier to charge a crime for whatever it *normally* would be charged for, like assault for example. To charge it as a hate crime, you have to *prove* intent. Having video makes this a tiny bit easier and you'd think it'd be open and shut but in reality it's a lot more difficult than that."

> Asian-Americans may be penalized for not adhering to racial stereotypes that peg them more as meek followers.

> The dominant East Asian employee was more disliked than the non-dominant East Asian employee, the non-dominant White employee, and the dominant White employee. A separate trial showed that participants held descriptive stereotypes of East Asians as being competent, cold, and non-dominant, while another showed that the most valued expectation of East Asians was that they ""stay in their place.""

> East Asians who don't conform to racial stereotypes are less likely to be popular in the workplace. ""In general, people don't want dominant co-workers,"" says Berdahl, ""but they really don't want to work with a dominant East-Asian co-worker.""

2,nzliw3,I understand what the C-Suite is but I don’t know what the C stands for
0,nqo1d9,"Sigh, yeah - the season 5 drop on USA Netflix is bittersweet knowing story loose ends won't be wrapped up. The news about a spinoff featuring Shannon was indeed puzzling to learn about back when that was announced. Like Shannon is an entertaining supporting character, but a whole spinoff series? Weird. 

The comment about how ""the characters never seemed to grow"" clicks for me in realizing why - despite really enjoying the show overall - something was ""missing"" to make it feel like a really satisfying show. Learning bout the lack of representation in the writer's room, guess it makes sense."
1,nqo1d9,"I'm currently reading Interior Chinatown and so much fo what Simu Liu writes about and experienced reminds me of the book.   
This is really unfortunate. 

I'm pretty annoyed that Shannon's going to get her own show... who is going to watch that? I feel like unfortunately KC's ultimately was still pandering/catering to the white gaze and even if a lot of Asians connected to it or enjoyed it, hearing about how this is unfolding makes me realize Asian voices weren't a priority."
2,nqo1d9,"I gotta say that after reading all the coverage of why the show ended, Ins Choi really comes off looking bad.  I know there's always two sides to every story but it really seems like he just dipped on the show and didn't even care to see it wrapped up nicely.  He deserves credit for the concept and for getting it off the ground, but I couldn't imagine creating something that became so important to so many people and then killing it for no reason, seemingly out of spite."
3,nqo1d9,Now I’m not so interested in finishing the show. I really wanted to see a Jung and Appa reconcile. It takes the teeth out of the show =(
4,nqo1d9,Canadian broadcast TV is crazy racist and non welcoming to PoC. I have a friend who worked for Bell and she told me how hard it was to even get her very practical ideas acknowledged by her bosses. She would point to the US and our (very slowly) diversifying network landscape and they would just nod and completely ignore her. It was really frustrating because she’s actually a really good writer with a lot of really interesting ideas that I thought would have been at least worth listening to. But they’re afraid of diversity.
5,nqo1d9,"Damn, reading that made me feel for him. It also exposed one of the fundamental problems with the show: that it lacked real Asian representation & female representation in the writers' room. It had no Korean writing & producing talent besides the show creator, and he also made no effort in nurturing other Korean talents either. When he left, there was no one to replace him.

I so badly wanted to like this show, but I just couldn't connect with it and couldn't put a finger on why. I'm an Asian immigrant living in Toronto, so I should love this! This show was made for me! I have friends who went to Janet's school, I recognized the neighbourhood where the store is supposed to be, and I've been on those damn street cars that drive past the convenience store. But it just never rang true to me. Now I know why. Compared to, say, FOTB, which had an Asian female show runner and many Asian writers (including Ali Wong), Kim's Convenience never felt right to me. It's so important to have representation behind the screen as well as in front of it. If we look at past works featuring POC main casts, the ones that succeed and resonate within the community are those made by POC, for POC (CRA, Always Be My Maybe, The Farewell, Black Panther, Moonlight etc.). Other works, like Mulan, with a fully white writing & directing team, ring hollow by comparison."
6,nqo1d9,Bummer but I hope this one ending paves the way for new shows to actually take a risk and let Asian characters develop.
7,nqo1d9,"I can’t believe they’re doing a spin-off with Shannon. I’ve only seen the show in passing but her character is so annoying! I skip all of her scenes. 

The treatment of this show versus Schitt’s Creek has been very interesting. The latter won Best Comedy at the Emmys and a bunch of other awards yet Kim’s Convenience has never even been nominated. Plus, the actors in KC were paid less despite having higher ratings. Besides Catherine O’Hara and Eugene Levy, all of the actors on SC were also unknown."
8,nqo1d9,"I watched something like 2-3 seasons before I decided I wasn't interested enough to keep going. The characters not growing is definitely true, but I'm shocked to hear that none of the writers were Asian."

2,evotxt,we're not a perfect place like other people claim.
3,evotxt,"I live in the US, and I have also seen a lot more racism towards Chinese people because of this. I don't know about Canada per se but a lot of US media has been focusing on this coronavirus story and constantly pushing out articles and news clips talking about it, using language that is frankly alarmist and racist. I know most of our media is owned by a few powerful interests and I think they are scared of China as a world power, trying to spread racist sentiment and fear in order to turn public opinion against the Chinese people. Not to say people are normally anti-racist towards us but it feels like many are being extra radicalized by the news coverage. I wonder if the Canadians posting here feel similarly about the situation? Or have a different take?"
4,evotxt,Coronavirus just gave bigoted people an excuse to be louder about it. I've been pretty disgusted by my local subreddit lately.
5,evotxt,"Here we go again. When Asians have a plague, non-Asians would become xenophobic and look at them under a bad light. This happened during the immigration movement when white people accuse Asians for bringing in disease (they just don’t have the standard medical care to treat it).

Looking back, I wish someone had said something to them (or even to me) about how wrong it was. But I was so concerned about fitting in and making friends, I didn't even think about the fact they were mocking me.  This is why we need representation and role models. Outside my family and our family friends, I didn't know any other Asians. It's not till now (like 30 years later) that I understand the importance of it and now I try to be an ally for all my AAAPI peeps around me."

On another note, it’s awesome that you take pride in being an Asian American. Self love is a beautiful thing!"
3,ttrqm2,"I definitely hated being Asian for probably 20+ years of my life. It makes me sad to think about now. In the 4th grade, I wore a yellow shirt and my entire class pretended that they couldn’t find me. In college, I was biking to class when some other students stuck a stick in my wheel and laughed “ching chong ching chong” while I fell to the ground. Why was my response to bullying to internalize the racism vs get angry? I have suspicions, but at least I don’t feel that way anymore. I’m happy to be living in a more diverse area now. I love connecting with other Asians."
4,ttrqm2,"Very similar experience. The experiences, both negative and positive, that I've had define me. Those experiences are a part of my collection and I hold them dear to me, even the negative ones. 

Without these experiences, I wouldn't be me. I wouldn't understand racism, and I wouldn't understand how to find growth and strength when faced with negativity around my identity."
5,ttrqm2,"Haha good one, love yourself! No one else can be you!"
6,ttrqm2,"I'm also a VietAm, we have very similar experience even if we are across the United States. I grew up in a mostly urban working class black and white area. There weren't many people that looked like me but in elementary school we bonded over Dragonball Z, Pokemon, Yugioh, and other Toonami stuff when Japanese Anime was hitting mainstream. It helped soften blow for the racism in many ways, and then we after elementary school we moved to a more liberal diverse area with a population that was about 10-15% East Asian, 5% South Asian, and a healthy mix in between of Arabs, Whites, Blacks and Latino where none of us really made a majority. But those Asian & White teenagers generally looked down on me because of what area me and certain black kids came from, it's left and awful taste in my mouth looking back on it, I asked my brother and he faced similar prejudice and attitudes and he just recently graduated from the high school & middle school in the area as well. In my college years, I've befriended quite a few black and white americans and we reflect on our own experiences in and I've garnered quite a bit of empathy, but these things take time."
7,ttrqm2,"I experienced some of this shit growing up too as a Chinese person, got in plenty of fights in middle school over it and also a confrontation my first year of college. 

All of it has only made me lean into my Asian heritage more. Making fun of Chinese? Too bad, guess you won't understand me talking shit about you to my friend in front of your face. I talk with the international students a lot at my school and it's great being able to converse with them in a language they're more comfortable with.

I had a lot of internalized self-hate growing up and it was a sticking point between myself and my parents when conversations of racial identity came up, but have been actively purging it from my system and we've never been closer as a family."
8,ttrqm2,"My grandma was really smart and had a lot of foresight.  She knew the importance of assimilating with American culture, so she only spoke to her grandchildren in English.  She babysat all her grandchildren while our parents worked, and she taught all of us how to read/write and do arithmetic before we even started kindergarten.

When I started kindergarten, I was the smartest child, and everyone knew it.  I would finish lessons early, and always raised my hand to answer questions.  My social skills were also better developed than most kids.  I tried to be friends with everyone, and was able to have long conversations.  I could also tell full stories like giving rundowns of episodes of my favorite tv show, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  But all of this changed the following year.

One day in 1st grade, everyone in class was given a copy of one of those Little Golden Books.  We went around the room, and each student had to read one sentence out loud, and then next student would read the following sentence.  I counted how many kids were ahead of me to figure out which sentence I had.  I don't recall the actual sentence, but I remember it was the longest sentence in the book, and it also had silent 'L's, like the words ""could"" and ""would"".  I was really excited, because I knew about silent 'L's, while most other students could only read phonetically, and a lot of them were struggling to sound out the letters.  When it was finally my turn, I confidently began reading my sentence.  However, before I could finish, my teacher interrupted me and told me that no one can understand what I was saying because of my Indian accent.  She then skipped me and my sentence, and went on to the next student.  I was really embarrassed about it.  Some kids started calling me ""Apu"" after that.

Before that day, I never understood the concept of culture, and I had always thought that I was normal just like every other kid.  After that day, I realized that I was different, and that something was wrong with me.  After that, I was afraid to talk, because I didn't want people to make fun of my voice.  I didn't have any friends because I stopped talking to others kids.  In class, I stopped raising my hand to answer the teacher's questions.  My social skills stopped developing normally after that.

What is especially fucked up is that I didn't even have an Indian accent.  I never did.  No one in my family did.  I started speaking English when I was 2, and exclusively spoke in English by 4.  I never spoke any other language long enough to develop an accent."

I’m Chinese-American, and I wasn’t fully comfortable with my identity until I studied Chinese history, listened to Chinese music, and read Chinese literature and philosophy. Doing these things made me realize that Western culture doesn’t even hold a candle those of East Asia, and now I feel far more reassured."

Given the way it's written, I suspect he might have been a Waishengren in his youth who did not have a great time among the Benshengren. I wouldn't expect LAPD to understand the nuances of Taiwanese politics but I wouldn't be surprised if this turned out to be the case. 

He also seems to have fallen on some hard times recently and apparently had a bit of a breakdown, not that it excuses what he did.

3,ur4bsv,"I wonder if his head injury changed his personality.  He went from pleasant apartment building owner to a mentally deteriorating homeless man after the injury:

>Chou had been a pleasant man who used to own the Las Vegas apartment building where he lived, Balmore Orellana told The Associated Press.

>But Orellana said Chou received a head injury and serious body injuries in an attack by a tenant and he sold the property. The neighbor said that last summer Chou fired a gun inside his apartment. No one was hurt but he was evicted.

>Orellana says Chou’s mental ability seemed to diminish in recent months, he was angry that the government didn’t provide comfort in his retirement, and he may have been homeless.


**EDIT:**  The timeline from another article seems to indicate the head injury was sustained about 5 years ago, but he was only evicted from his apartment building in February.  So it's hard to say if the injury contributed to his recent mental decline: https://www.1011now.com/2022/05/16/police-name-suspect-deadly-attack-california-church/"
4,ur4bsv,"So is this guy actually Taiwanese? It said he lived in Taiwan and his wife lives there, the last name Chou all pointing towards that. If he’s family is forcibly removed from China in the 40s, him being 68, that probably means he was born in/grew up in Taiwan? 

What actually identified him as Chinese?"
5,ur4bsv,This article gets a few basic things wrong. It says he has been a U.S. citizen for years yet his nationality is Chinese? His nationality is American then and his ethnicity is Chinese! Unless this is written by someone who conflates American with white.

7,ur4bsv,"After reading this article and having a better context about his motives, it all reeks of social media's emotionally engineered engagement coupled with mental illness due to his previous injuries. I'm not excusing his behavior whatsoever but I'm definitely putting much of the blame of this on social media and the hyper-targeting of people's emotions just so they can view more ads. Newspapers and magazines could also achieve the same thing during the print media heyday, no doubt about that, but the internet and the devices we use to access media now is way more targeted and insidious. Everyone involved, including the shooter, was a victim to that. Same could be said about the shooting in Buffalo, New York, the church in South Carolina, the Synagogue in Dallas and so many other relatively recent mass shootings involving hatred in the last several years."

> A gunman in deadly attack at California church was Chinese immigrant motivated by hate for Taiwanese people, authorities said. Orange County Sheriff Don Barnes said the motive of the shooting was a grievance between the shooter, identified as a Chinese immigrant, and the Taiwanese community. Barnes said the suspect drove to the Orange County church, where he was not a regular attendee, secured the doors and started shooting.
> 
> The shooting killed Dr. John Cheng, 52, and five others were wounded in an attack at a Southern California church, authorities said at a Monday news conference. Barnes said Cheng, survived by a wife and two children, heroically charged at the shooter and attempted to disarm him, allowing others to intervene.

I know Boston/Lowell has a large Cambodian community, but surprised to read from this article that the Bronx has a noticeable presence also. What neighborhood and how sizable is the population?"
7,8tw3r7,"The best part is our own “activists” buy into the bullshit and *insist* that, no, Asian Americans **are** privileged! The Model Minority myth isn’t a myth at all, it actually has some truth to it! 

We’re the white people of POC guys. If any of us try to talk about issues that negatively impact our community, we’re ignoring our *privilege*. What we *should* do is completely elevate the voices of *other* marginalized groups because they have it worse than us! That’s how we can make ***real progress***. The greatest issue in Asian American communities is **solely** anti-blackness, and if you disagree, you’re just another rich Asian who’s practically as white as Paul Ryan and can’t see beyond their own ***privilege***."
8,8tw3r7,"I'm an Asian American in NYC and have been following the SHSAT drama for quite some time. Had family members that went to Stuyvesant as well. Although Asian Americans are historically a minority group that receive little aid despite the highest rates of poverty, I want to urge other Asian Americans to NOT place blame on the Latino and African American community. I've seen it too often with my uncles and aunties. All minorities must involve ourselves in other minority issues to achieve true equality - we, as Asians, can't settle being second on the totem poll in terms of racial privilege (we must all strive to be on the same level).

A bit of history - when Italian and Irish immigrants came to America in the early 20th century, they were paid more than African Americans despite doing the same work. The reasoning was to segregate the lower class to avoid disruption of the upper class (the factor owners). Same shit in the seventies and eighties - the ""model minority"" myth was used as a sword against Black and Latino Americans during the crack era in NY. That type of discrimination is used to justify zoning laws, gentrification, and displacement. It's pressure to assimilate.

The lack of aid for Asian immigrants is the fault of the government and the silence of our political voices and political prowess. It is NOT the African or Latino community causing our problems. As a matter of fact, we NEED them in our fight for equality and justice.

Like, shit was infuriating with the Peter Liang case - where we learned that we weren't white the hard way lol. We shouldn't be expecting privilege - we should be expecting justice for the murders caused by the other police officers."

The example of ""hashtags for 3 months"" forgets the increase in hate crimes over the last year that was ignored and the whole history of government action against Asian Americans throughout this country's history.

Just remember, until recently we've been invisible. Civil rights has always centered black people when it has had other minority support as well as benefits. 

Unfortunately that narrative in that tweet is all too common and undercuts the fact that we should all support each other in solidarity instead of continuing to play the oppression olympics."
1,myb0j6,"Re this tweet: On a substantive level, it's also much easier politically to pass a hate crimes bill (more law enforcement, which is popular with conservatives) than it is to change the entire structure of law enforcement & possibly defund it. FWIW, hate crimes against South Asians, Arabs and Muslims were prosecuted after 9/11 and it didn't stop Islamophobia from making an ugly return in 2015, so I don't even really think this is an effective response to anti-Asian hate. More of a band-aid, in the same way that ""police training"" is a band-aid to the problem of police killings of Black people.

And while I think it's a dumb metric to judge how ""valid"" your BIPOC-ness is, South Asian-Americans, Muslim Americans, Sikh Americans etc. *have* faced heavy targeting by law enforcement. Law enforcement has been infiltrating mosques and brown communities since before 9/11, but increased drastically after it. In Canada, where enclaves of the South Asian community trend more lower income than in the US due to different immigration rules, these areas are heavily overpoliced. ([I would read this report on the issue if you're interested](https://www.issuelab.org/resources/14985/14985.pdf).)

6,myb0j6,"I think that some people don't consider AAPI as POC because their vision of who a person of color is is someone who is disadvantaged or in need of help. AAPI, while still facing social stigma and disadvantage, are able to go to good colleges and get well-paying jobs comparable to white people. For people with white savior complexes, the fact that we have managed to do well is a sign that we ""aren't struggling"" and hence aren't POC. 

The issues we face are real, and the issues black people face are real, as well. AAPI are still POC, though. It was us who were forced into ghettos because no one else could stand us. It was us who had legislature written to keep us from working and then from even immigrating. It was us who were sent to camps for treasons we never committed. Simply because black people face more adversity doesn't invalidate that which we have—and are—enduring.

tl:dr, some white people have this idea in their head that POC are people who need saving, and our relative financial success therefore makes us ineligible. Black people have a slew of race-based struggles that need to be overcome, *and* Asian people have race-based struggles that need to be overcome. Black people may face more inequalities, but we are still both POC."
7,myb0j6,"I second the comment by u/Migoreng_Pancit about the model minority myth. That myth/stereotype helps to keep us and our struggles invisible and make it so that we have a burden to *prove* that we are even being discriminated against in the first place.

8,myb0j6,"These people are racist. Period. Asians are definitely BIPOC. The reason why STOPAAPIHATE is so much successful than BLM is because BLM  takes aim at the white institution, which takes extensive research, open mindedness, and active participation to revoke generations of societal norms put on us. Whereas STOPAAPIHATE is a single-issue, easy to understand topic of simply stopping hate crimes on AAPI. 


Anyone touting that ""AsiAnS aReNt POC"" are just closeted racists who just using this as an excuse to finally find their hate against Asians. They are the EXACTLY same as all lives matter, with their moronic argument of ""what about us"" because they refuse to recognize that the elevation of any POC is the elevation of ALL POC. 


It's always heartbreaking to see my community have such terrible relations with the black community because I think both are victims of a white institution and I hope that these people will see that eventually."

11,myb0j6,"BIPOC don’t always face the same issues or have the same agenda. 

I just like to point out that trans people are getting murdered everyday and we don’t see a hashtag, and I’m sure that Latinos are not having the best time of their lives right now either. 

That being said, each community has its own issues. Black community is, I think, more concerned with the systematic racism in the police force and has the agenda to defund the police department and transform into a community policing model. The pressing issue that Asians are facing right now is people being assholes. The bill that passed the senate provides more tools for local law enforcement and adds an office in the DOJ. We cheered when NYDP assigned undercover Asian police officers and when they arrested offenders. That would not be BLM’s agenda."
12,myb0j6,Why are we signalboosting a nobody on Twitter?
13,myb0j6,"It depends how you define BIPOC. I've heard it as black, indigenous AND people of color, but also as black and indigenous people of color. One is essentially a rebranding of POC that highlights black and indigenous struggle, and the other is just a new, more specific subcategory, like East or South Asians and Asians."

16,myb0j6,"It's hard to tell, some people use it like it means black, indigenous, AND people of color (ofc sometimes we're not even POC), while others use it to mean black and indigenous only (as in only those POC count). Tbh those people really just use it as another word for black imo, because indigenous issues don't get brought up nearly as often.

Sometimes we're even white! We are Schrodinger's minority."
17,myb0j6,"I'm Black and to me BIPOC = anyone who is not white, which 1000000% includes the majority of Asians.

18,myb0j6,"Is this ""bipoc"" actually a thing outside of stupid twitter nerds?"
19,myb0j6,"In Ontario, Canada, the more official term for minorities is ""racialized group"" or ""racialized persons"" as it recognizes that people can be racialized on many dimensions."
20,myb0j6,"1. PROPORTIONS. Proportionally Asian Americans have suffered from exponentially higher rates of racial violence in 2020 and 2021. Black Americans have suffered from consistent rates of police brutality (if that's what he's hinting at) thus if the proportions don't jump then it wouldn't seem like anything's out of the ordinary. 
2. DIFFERENT PARTIES TO BLAME. The culprit in the spike in hate crimes against Asians are all private individuals. Reforming the police (which is the assumed culprit in police brutality against black Americans) is almost impossible due to systematic immunity for law enforcement. 
3. MODEL MINORITY. The model minority myth of Asians being successful and not having social problems of their own is shared not just by the white American majority but also almost everyone else including Blacks, Hispanics, and even Asian Americans themselves."
21,myb0j6,"I think people are evaluating this too much on ""asians got an anti-hate crime bill already?? before x race?"" without considering what it actually does... Many non-asian BIPOC call for reforming or dismantling policing. This bill does not do that, and instead is basically pro-police (which is why some asian activists dont actually like it). So it's no surprise that it got passed, and it's not rly a ""before"" thing either bc many similar bills giving more power to police have been passed in response to the height of protests last yr but without the ""anti-hate crime"" label. 

More broadly, i think it kinda shows how little people are aware of Asian American history... yeah we got 1 toothless bill bc people were lighting us on fire for a virus, does that actually address the systemic history of anti-asian violence domestically and imperialism abroad by the US? Asian activists have fought for decades for so much more meaningful demands w/o success. This wasnt just a 3 month hashtag thing. & meanwhile the state continues to spew anti-Chinese rhetoric so it's not at all like theyve totally rallied behind asians"
22,myb0j6,Yes. Wtf? Yes
23,myb0j6,"my take is that most asians are POC except for some russians and western asians who I guess can go either way

*some* asians are brown. some ppl got shit after 9/11 and others didn't. that's a meaningful difference

let's talk about the term ""indigenous"" tho because it's very confusing. If you're indigenous to some place, and you relocate (like a refugee) do you stop being indigenous? Or are you indigenous no matter where you go

Like


central americans in the US might have native american ancestry but they're no more indigenous to california than I am. they might not have anything in common with the native cultures of california

The Chinese have been chilling in those river valleys forever. Does it make sense to talk about them as indigneous people?

Are jews indigenous to israel? lok"
24,myb0j6,"Black, indigenous, and person of color? Does that mean black and indigenous people are no longer people of color but instead their own categories? Or does it refer to only people of color who are black and/or indigenous?

Either way, I certainly don't identify as BIPOC, and only consider myself POC in the same vein I consider myself a non-Zoroastrian or a non-golfer - sure, I guess technically I am, but that's not something I'd ever identify as. I prefer ""minority"" because it's honest and conditional on where I'm living. When I'm in the US, I'm a minority, and when I'm visiting family in China, I'm a majority. It'd be insane for me as a Han Chinese to move to China and then still identify as POC, as if the white - nonwhite narrative means anything in a 99.9% Chinese environment."
25,myb0j6,"Everyone should remember that there are Black Asians. So...racism is a cross-cutting concern.

As for BIPOC, I've heard the term defined as ONLY Black and Indigenous POC and also ESPECIALLY Black and Indigenous + POC. So it depends."
26,myb0j6,"I ignore those kind of people. There’s going to be those “Asians aren’t POC” or “Asians are basically white.” In every race and crowd. Focus on us. 

Also, if you’re thinking about blaming the Black community because of a small minority of them for saying this kind of shit. Fucking stop."
27,myb0j6,"NOT OUR FUCKING PROBLEM how anyone else feels about it, or what they want to call us - we have to just stand together to protect ourselves, efficiently and definitively. So we can go back to Japanese hating on Chinese and vice versa like it’s suppose to be. For now, stand together."

There are a lot of people who straight up have never seen people other than their own race before bootcamp. Hollywood had created certain expectations in their mind of people of other races and this is possibly their first encounter to see if people of other cultures really are like that.

That being said, most people are just curious and don't really know an appropriate way to ask questions to someone who looks different from themselves. Things like microaggressions you just have to accept as ignorance and hopefully one day explain to them when they get to know you more.

Anyway, I'd say that your experience will vary depending on what kind of people happen to be in your unit. I'm been in the Air Force for a little over 7 years and it hasn't been that bad. In Basic Training I experienced a bunch of racism from my fellow trainees and MTI. I didn't get physically abused or anything, but was subjected to comments like ""Welcome to America"", ""Your English is pretty good"" and ""Do they do this in China?"". I could tell some of the white kids from the South didn't like me, but oh well. 

There were instances at my first base where people would say ignorant things like ""Is it true that cats and dogs are served at Chinese restaurants?"" and whatnot. But honestly, I think my experience has been pretty good so far. I think racism towards Asians is probably more prevalent in branches like the Marine Corps since there's less racial diversity."

Mind you we were in a combat unit, very rough around the edge and cursed like hell.

Well, I *could* do that, but I'd be a colossal asshole, and that roommate could easily leave and go somewhere else and I'd be fucked.  At that point, who's actually paying for the apartment?"

Can't even trust the damn transportation these days
17,7h72r3,"Hey /u/quant18, what do you think about the comments in this thread? Or is everyone just being ""East Asian centric?"""
18,7h72r3,Things like this just make you wonder if the business owner wants to make money.
0,ta2tw9,"Had to deal with this very frequently, almost every day, growing up in Italy. Just have a good comeback to confuse them.

A comment I would get a lot is ""wow, you're Italian is really good"" to which I would reply ""thanks, so is yours!"" the looks of confusion are priceless."
1,ta2tw9,"Ugh. I'm sorry that happened to you.

I got a ""ping pong"" once when I was walking down the street in Marseille. I told him to go f himself in French, and he grabbed my neck and tried to scare me. Then he called me a stupid imperialist American. He let me go when I called him a murdering colonialist and reminded him that the French screwed up bad in Algeria. I don't know why he let me go then, but he did. A woman who saw the exchange rushed over and asked if it was a lover's quarrel. I didn't know how to politely ask if she was dropped on the head as a baby.

My friends also called me Jackie (Jackie Chan) when they first met me.

So yea, they have real messed up views on race. I'm glad I left."
2,ta2tw9,"Yep. Right of passage for any Asian American in Europe. Lived in Germany for 5 years and worked in the UK for a year. You just have to have a NY type attitude and be like, “you talking to me??” In those years and a dozen such encounters, I have never had one hold their ground. Deep down they’re chickenshit."
3,ta2tw9,Oof I've heard this is VERY normal in France. So frustrating.

5,ta2tw9,"As young as 12 walking around NYC, I’d have Latin males walk by me and say “Chino Chino”. I learned fast to quickly respond “puta madre”
I’m glad my kids don’t have to deal with that.  But at the same time, I kinda wish they did."
6,ta2tw9,"I was visiting French Canada with my mom when I was in highschool, and when we were just walking down the street minding our own business a group of teenage boys were yelling ""CHINA FASHION CHINA FASHION"" in a French accent to us. I stopped, turned to them and said ""I speak English better than you."" I was born in Canada. 

They were too scared to say anything after that."
7,ta2tw9,"I get that and “konnichiwa” enough here at home in the States that I guess it doesn’t even phase me anymore.  For better or worse, the more you travel the more experiences of all kinds you’ll get.  I hope it doesn’t stop you from exploring the world!"

9,ta2tw9,"Don't be embarrassed. I used to be like that because their actions put me on the spot, completely unprepared. This feeling is completely normal, much like a student randomly being picked by a teacher to answer a question in class.

Stand your ground. Grit your teeth if you have to. And reply with an emphatic Bonjour."
10,ta2tw9,"Welcome to Europe lol. Outside of the British isles, microaggressions and strangers staring will be constant. Happens in British isles too, but usually not as bad as continental Europe. People like to rib on North America, but for Asians, it's not as bad as Europe. There's a history of large immigration to North America from Asia. Europe has never had that same immigration wave from Asia (aside from Turkey and Middle East)."
11,ta2tw9,"Yep, I spent a year living in Paris and traveled a lot around Western Europe. Got plenty of ni hao and konnichiwa. It sucked because for whoever says it it’s such a thoughtless, throwaway comment, but I would feel upset for like an hour or more after it happened. This was about a decade ago :-/ it’s unfortunate that kind of racism and stereotyping still persists."
12,ta2tw9,You shouldve made some frog ribbit ribbit noises at him
13,ta2tw9,lmao this is normal in europe. grew up my entire life here as an asian looking dude. literally happened today. just ignore it or diss them back if you got some good comebacks. but dont bother too much.. not worth the time
14,ta2tw9,"I'm unoriginal, but I just say, ""fuck you"" and usually they get it (edit: I find this phrase very universally understood around the world). If they don't understand why saying nihao is racist, they're not going to understand a subtle comeback.

I'm sorry that happened to you. People (Europeans included) always like to think Europeans are so cultured and progressive. It's there, below the surface."
15,ta2tw9,"I was in Italy, and we walked past some heroin junkie panhandlers who hassled the white people for spare change, but not me. I heard them mutter, ""Don't bother asking the Chinese. They're stingy and don't give jack shit.""

damn right, i ain't giving you dumbfucks jack shit.

*Io capisco italiano, stronzo!*"
16,ta2tw9,"I dealt with this a lot in Turkey. The funny thing is, whenever I confronted people about it, they became super friendly and actually took the time to talk to me and get to know me. I remember I was once walking on a street and a group of dudes randomly started yelling “Konnichiwa! Playstation! Sony!” at me. I stopped and went up and talked to them and they were actually good dudes. One of them actually ran off to the corner store to buy some snacks for me. I once had some guy on the street actually take me to a restaurant and buy me dinner and then take me to hookah with his friends (I’m a dude, there was no creepiness involved).

It is certainly uncomfortable to be hyper aware of your own race like that but at least in Turkey, the comments were more out of ignorance and curiosity than malice.

I always wonder what people from China think when someone says “ni hao” to them on the street, like are they pleasantly surprised or annoyed? When I was in Thailand I would sometimes see local Thai vendors greeting Chinese tourists in Chinese, and they didn’t seem fazed by it, but I guess there is less of a racial aspect to it there. Likewise when white tourists go to Asia the locals routinely just greet them in English even if they might not be native English speakers. I guess it would be awkward if you were a white person who was a native speaker of an Asian language and people kept talking to you in English."
17,ta2tw9,"I've experienced similar things while in continental Europe as well. 
I grew up in the Midwest, which has its problems, but in the 9 months I was in Europe, I encountered way more racial harassment than in all my life in the US.

The only time I felt like I was in great physical danger was in Berlin (one of the most international cities in Europe). I was walking around the city (actually headed towards to bus station to leave Germany), and got stopped by a burly dude who just got in my face yelled at me in German for god knows how long as I muttered back to him that I was an American and didn't speak English. He just screamed at me for a bit, and huffed away. It was a relatively busy street, but everyone just passed me by. 

I had another incident in a bar in Berlin, where a German who had studied in Australia cornered me, and proceeded to tell me that Asians are the ugliest, immoral, cheap, pathetic people on Earth with examples of why he thought all that to be true. 

I really didn't expect such hostility in Berlin being progressive and diverse, but it was the worst city I've ever been in. Yes, worse than some small towns in rural Alabama and Mississippi that I stopped for lunch on a road trip.

Hope your friends are supportive, and good luck with the rest of your trip."
18,ta2tw9,"I think what I would do it is saying Bonjour back when he said nihao, but of course I understand at that moment, it’s hard to think about anything.."
19,ta2tw9,"Happened to me here in the States... I responded ""what?"" When he doubled down and said it louder, I said, loudly and slowly ""I'm sorry, I don't understand what you're saying"". 

Normally I'm more polite after asking ""what?"" (out of genuine surprise), but if they double down, I'll pull the ""Do YoU kNoW eNgLiSh"" pattern of speech... usually embarrasses them enough to think twice before doing it again to someone else.

I admire people for trying, but there's a time and place for that (like at a Chinese cultural festival or when visiting China or when hanging out with your Chinese friend or in Chinese clasd) and randomly in public is not it.

I'm a Korean adoptee, btw... literally learned ""ni hao"" in college because of that incident 😅"
20,ta2tw9,"This kind of casual racism is everywhere. I’ve had the konichiwas in France but I also had ch*nk in Boston. The common thing is that they’re usually dumb youth just f*cking around so I never took it seriously. 

I balance it with all the awesome people I meet. In France, kind people helping me when I was lost in the streets of Nice, an incredibly charming waiter in Rome, friendly B&b owner in Madrid, friendly cabbie in London. The positive experiences in Europe outweigh the dumb street kids who were rude by far."
21,ta2tw9,"I’m so sorry this happened to you. About 10 years ago I went on a girls’ trip to Paris with some of my relatives. We did all of the great things—ate at small little restaurants, baguettes and croissants every day, walked the streets for hours and hours. But the only thing I really remember is when some dudes yelled “Ching Chong” at us on our last day."
22,ta2tw9,Every culture has racists but this is why I prefer the polite racism we have in the USA as opposed to overt constant bullshit
23,ta2tw9,"Would you consider responding with humor and a stereotype French people hate?

They have different views on race there than in the states and Canada....

24,ta2tw9,"Once when I was in Montpellier, I almost got into a fight with a group of teenagers for precisely this. I’m sorry to hear what happened to you."
25,ta2tw9,"My response to 'ni hao' directed at me here in town (DC) is always: 'my knee's fine, how's yours?'."
26,ta2tw9,Combat reactionaries
27,ta2tw9,That happened to me and my family in freaking Quebec! I’m sorry that you had to experience that.
28,ta2tw9,"I had three black French perhaps mid 20s - mid 30s go full racist language and sound effects to me and my partner at the base of Montmarte. Something I don't forget. I even replied to them, ""why?"" with more words, but was pulled away before something bad happened - perhaps to me."
29,ta2tw9,"I have had people call me ""Jackie Chan"" and random kids yelling ""chino"" or making kungfu noises when I was travelling in Argentina and some countries in the middle east. I found it to be quite harmless back then but it gets pretty annoying since it's not a one off thing.

Most of the time I just wave and smile. Didn't want to cause any trouble, especially in foreign countries where I am not fluent in the language."
30,ta2tw9,"In England now, some random dude asked me if I was Chinese. I’m korean. Properly fuck off dude."
31,ta2tw9,Make sure you learn French swear words for these kinds of encounters
32,ta2tw9,Ugh I’m traveling there in a month. I expect things like this to happen but was hopeful I won’t encounter it but looks like it def will
33,ta2tw9,"This happened to me too several times while living in France. One time it was a young teenager on the street, and my friend tried to talk back at the kid, but it only ended up in the teen trying to steal my friend's phone. Another time someone passed by me on a scooter and yelled ""salope chinoise"" at me. It was so random and unwarranted. I was living in Montpellier at the time and worked in a public school part time to teach English. In one class, a little girl who must have been only 6 years old mocked me doing the slanty eyes gesture. I honestly was baffled and ignored it because I did not know how to react. It felt really awful. This was at the start of 2020, so once news of covid started breaking out, some kids would mock me more. Very reflective of their parents...Oh, and don't get me started with the nonsensical and horrible comments on Tinder lol. 
Sadly it is not a rare occurrence... I can't imagine what French Asians deal with on the daily."

35,ta2tw9,Sucker punch. Learn how to do it well and you won’t have to do anything else
36,ta2tw9,I mindfucked a guy to the shadow realm when I responded in fluent French that I was Vietnamese. They don't know how to react.
37,ta2tw9,"Traveled through Europe several times - people would mutter stuff, but it was never more than annoying. The racism in Europe was always more subtle or “passive” vs in America where it’s always been more aggressive."
38,ta2tw9,"I was born & raised in the states. SOOOO many times people say ""konichiwa"" or ""ni hao"" to me. They genuinely think there's nothing wrong with that. It makes me so livid. I'm not even east asian (i'm SEA) so for sure ALL asians look the same to them. They can't tell the difference between us. Makes me so mad that I'm an American citizen, yet will always be looked at as an outsider."
39,ta2tw9,Just wave your hand and move on. You will find ignorance everywhere in the world. I live in south america and deal with that shit at least once a week.
40,ta2tw9,What's embarrassing about it?
41,ta2tw9,I saw one girl do the slanty eyed gesture to me while I was traveling in Spain. This happened pretty recently (around 2018.) It’s sad that there are still plenty of ignorant people out there in this day and age. But sometimes racism works in my favor. I ended up hooking up with a Spanish college student during the same trip who was attracted to me solely because of K-pop lol. Sometimes there are fringe benefits of being an exoticized other haha.

43,ta2tw9,"When I was around 8 or 9 and visiting Las Vegas with my family in the late 1990s, this 4 or 5 year old white girl randomly came up to my family's table at the hotel buffet we were eating at and said ""ni hao"" to us. We're Vietnamese. My grandparents were amused but I was like ""tf?"""

0,t1fcf0,"It's weird because the flip side of this conversation is also occasionally problematic when people act like just any Asian would do to fit another Asian role because we're all the same. Not saying that people have to be limited to only playing their own type of Asian, but there seems like a balance needs to be in place.

I also notice Hollywood generally has more Chinese-American and Korean-American representation than most other Asians. Maybe I'm wrong, but I can sometimes see why that doesn't necessary evoke a sense of representation among some other Asian people because they don't necessarily see other Asians as the same as themselves.

Of course that doesn't mean I'm justifying whitewashing but the conversation is so much more nuanced."
1,t1fcf0,"A lot of time I feel like the people who ostentatiously tout those ""see, *they* don't think it's racist!"" videos/interviews are doing so deliberately in order to minimize and dismiss the concerns of PoC generally and AAs specifically."
2,t1fcf0,"to elaborate: cultural appropriation has an infinitely greater impact on the treatment of Asians who live in communities and countries where we are a marginalized minority, as well as our own relationships to our mother culture. 

Mainland Asians do not personally experience the vast bulk of the negative effect of cultural appropriation, both as people who grew up in a cultural majority and as people who do not witness the impact cultural appropriation has on diaspora Asians and the countries in which we reside.

EDIT: i have no idea where the term mainland asian being used to refer to Asians in Asia came from (including island nations like Japanese in Japan, Indonesians in Indonesia, etc.), but i didn't come up with it, it's a term used very frequently in my circles. i understand the confusion about it, the best alternative I've heard here imo is ""native Asian""."
3,t1fcf0,Succinct and hard hitting truth. This is a great clapback to whites trying to pretend Johansons whitewashing isn't a problem because the creator of Ghost in the Shell didn't mind it.
4,t1fcf0,"Very, very true. If a person has never experienced racism, it doesn't matter if they're non-white. They fundamentally lack the experience and their opinions won't ever have the same weight on the subject as someone who has. 

Saving this post for future reference."
5,t1fcf0,"From a Western perspective that might be true, but there is also cultural appropriation of various Asian cultures by other Asians, which is still problematic. There are still more and less dominant cultures there that have similar issues with appropriation that aren't really captured in this particular hot take.

Say for instance someone from China appropriating Korean culture, or someone in Japan appropriating Thai culture. There's still an effect on those whose cultures have been appropriated."
6,t1fcf0,"Sorry, what does Mainland mean?"
7,t1fcf0,"What is ""mainland"" Asian? This is a term I am very unfamiliar with. We talking FOBs? Those in the motherland? Mainland Chinese only?"
8,t1fcf0,"Where did the term “mainland Asian” come from? What do u call people in Indonesia or Malaysia, for example, if mainland Asian seems to be used to refer to Asians in Asia?"
9,t1fcf0,Isn't this just fact? Why would it ever start a fight?
10,t1fcf0,"I grew up non-diasporic and I highly agree with this. I hate it when they ask non-diaspora Asians about appropriation and they’ll of course be fine with it! It doesn’t affect their opportunities nor how they’re perceived. Not to mention, there is not a lot of awareness of how white supremacy is embedded into Western media and we grow up thinking white people are the ideal so what’s the big deal if we never see Asians? I see people who look like me all the time!"
11,t1fcf0,"it doesn't affect us either. moral outrage over cultural appropriation is the result of our weird american pathology where our identity is decoupled from expressions of shared morals, ethnic continuity, what we do etc. our identity is instead ""what we believe inside"", inner peace, which absent of shared morals, ethnic continuity can only be expressed as fashion, food, etc. if *anybody* can wear a qipao, speak thai, or make kimchi, what does that make us? oh. call my therapist."
12,t1fcf0,"Personally I think cultural appropriation is way overblown. For example, so what if a white girl wants to wear a traditional Chinese dress to prom? She isn't shitting on it in anyway. She thinks it's cute. 

It's gate keeping. Now is there harmful ways to do this? I can agree. But I don't think it's necessarily always bad and most of the time it's other people being interested in ours. And that isn't a problem and never will be."
13,t1fcf0,"Since when did people start using the term ""mainland Asian""?"
14,t1fcf0,Never heard of a mainland Asian…more made up labels I guess
15,t1fcf0,"Well, there is one thing I can say for this post and that's that this certainly complies with rule 2!

""Center Asian American experiences""

emphasis _American_"
16,t1fcf0,"This is too divisive for my taste. What is more disrespectful some one wearing a kimono or completely shutting up or ignoring the opinion of someone born in Japan. Mainly because their opinion may make it difficult to articulate why that person wearing a kimono offends you. Forget that, in this example the article of clothing being appropriated is from Japan and to follow this advice we have to dismiss the person from Japan. 

Also that t shirt this guy is wearing is a derivative of the Keep Calm.... which was a slogan created for the British in WW2 in response to air raids. If we were going to be intellectually honest this is a form of cultural appropriation."
17,t1fcf0,"I guess in a strictly western-centric view of it, it certainly does ring true. However, I think that cultural appropriation is used in this instance to point out how non-Asians culturally appropriate from Asians, but I think that mainland Asians can also experience cultural appropriation in different ways and not just from Non-Asians."
18,t1fcf0,… agreed.

0,l1z0v4,"A lot of these dim sum restaurants are like retirement homes for older Chinese folks like my parents. For my dad, in particular, going to dim sum was just about the only kind of socialization he'd get outside of the house. They knew everyone at the restaurant: the other folks who also came every day, the waiters and waitresses, and the managers. 

And I met a wonderful older gentleman who would sit at the same table every day because that was how he and his late wife would spend THEIR days. He passed on as well, and I hope that he and his wife are now at their favorite dim sum joint in the afterlife now.

1,fzitxv,"Bill Maher is a racist dressed up as a weed smoking progressive. People think he's a progressive only because he goes so hard on religion especially Catholicism. But he's as pigheaded as Republicans except with a generous varnish of being friendly towards WASP liberals.

Just look at how hard he goes on Muslims."
2,fzitxv,"Relevant: ""Bill Maher has been a public racist for a long time. Here are the receipts.""

https://archive.thinkprogress.org/bill-maher-racist-history-b1d9c74283cd/"
3,fzitxv,"He presents a completely false dichotomy. His argument centres on the fact that:

1. If we call if the Chinese Virus, we can hold China accountable and save lives.

2. If we call it Covid-19, we’re not holding them accountable and it will cost lives.

I don’t see why the name of the virus is particularly important for holding China accountable for its actions, especially when the reasoning for not naming the virus after China came from WHO guidelines set in place in 2015 (years before the virus came about). For god sakes, put sanctions, set higher tariffs whatever, naming the virus the “China Flu/Virus” is so pointless. It achieves nothing in terms of holding a China accountable and is basically akin to petty namecalling (the Trump special I guess). 

I also have no idea where Bill gets the idea that calling it the “China Flu” will save lives. If the implication is that playground insults will submit China into better health regulations as opposed to any other tangible actions then he’s wrong. If the implication is that health professionals will somehow benefit (?) then he’s super wrong. Having currently been placed at a hospital, I’ve not seen a single doctor struggle with the current nomenclature. 

It also annoys me to no end that people blame wet markets. Wet markets are fucking everywhere in China and are no more dangerous or dirty than some of the fish markets here in Sydney. It’s the regionally isolated selling of exotic wildlife in these wet markets which should be investigated. 

Finally, this guy seems to brush past the consequences as if they’re nothing. Completely skimming over the racist-fueled violence against ABCs in the past months as if it’s a necessary means to an ends. Someone needs to link him the incident of the asian woman doused with acid in NY. 

Bill just doesn’t understand the cost of aggressive names such as “China Virus” and can barely justify the benefits. What a joke."

We should blame China!* He acknowledges the possibility of racist ""idiots,"" like it's few bad apples we have to worry about, as opposed to widespread racist sentiment; he says we need to have faith that Americans will be able to understand that it's a criticism of *government* embedded into the words ""chinese virus"" and not the Chinese/Asian American population-at-large; and then he goes on whine about how liberal twitter has ruined words and language in 2020. Honestly, I wish liberal twitter would have done a better job ruining this..."
7,fzitxv,"Honestly, I suspect liberals only really liked this guy in the past because of his rants towards evangelical Christians. (Which, as somebody who used to watch them, were pretty funny) But besides that and his opposition to Trump, on cultural issues he has many similarities with conservatives. He was always one of those people who advocated for blanket smearings of Islam and masked them as ""cultural critiques."" Its no surprise now that he's set his sights on Chinese culture and no less over the issue that has already been debunked, ie. ""eating bat soup."""
8,fzitxv,"He get into a hissy fit because scientists, ""who are generally liberals"", didn't name the virus base on location.

Went on to say getting offended shouldn't stop people from reporting the facts.

His whole argument is just his racist opinion. He ain't a scientist. How the hell would he know what or how they name things? Spanish flu isn't from Spain.

He used liberals and pc culture to push his opinionated argument.


I'm all for criticizing the Chinese government failure to crack down on exotic animal eating. But if you're gonna use it's the liberal fault then it's a bullshit stance. Especially the bullshit part about scientist are generally liberals. What the hell does that even mean? Does that mean he'll believe his shit stained underwear over scientists?"
9,fzitxv,Bill Maher sucks donkey dicks.
10,fzitxv,HBO Cancelled. Thanks Bill
11,fzitxv,Is Bill Maher still relevant?
12,fzitxv,"Lol people need to reaLize not calling it a Wuhan disease isn’t about defending the CCP or how the Chinese government continues to do shady shit. It’s to stop ignorant racists from obtaining more fuel and for the people who want to use fear and anger to manipulate an agenda. 


Hate the CCP all you want but don’t be blind to what this is doing to actual people who have little to do or control over what the CCP does."
13,fzitxv,"The funny thing is that I've heard this guy call himself a ""progressive"" before.

This guy is about as progressive as North Korea is democratic."
14,fzitxv,Is anyone actually surprised? A conservative 'Liberal' wasn't going to have this take in this situation?
15,fzitxv,Oh please. He knows exactly what he’s feeding into. I can’t stand people like him.
16,fzitxv,"Bill Maher is not a liberal, may have been at some point in the past but is definitely not one now. He only labels himself ""liberal"" to attract a younger audience (and younger girlfriends for that matter).

The dude's just a boomer."

1,v7j6x6,"The sad thing is that he won because Asian people voted for him as a second choice. He spoke a couple words of Chinese and people loved it. I guess we have to be more vigilant and research the candidates. But who knew they would have such a dislike of Asian people. Boudin, Collins, and Lopez. They also double down instead of listening to us. They all seem to have this attitude of we know best and we are not going to change."
2,v7j6x6,"so I live in sf and um. I'm just kinda upset that London Breed is gonna pick our next DA. Like honestly, if sf didn't like this guy, fine! We don't like him. But.

7,v7j6x6,"I'm sure Chesa's a good guy with the heart in the right place to help out the disadvantaged and the less resourced, but his role and job is to prosecute crimes that overall society wants hime to.

8,v7j6x6,"nothing's going to change, just going to empower the most racist urban police department in the US to do less work and blame ???? for the lack of results. Anne Marie Schubert's ""tough-on-crime"" approach in Sac hasn't produced better results than progressive prosecutors in LA/SF. 

What will be fascinating is what San Francisco scapegoats next."
9,v7j6x6,"Progressives are gonna lose hard next election. I'm not american but I am seeing signs of republican trying to be less racist and seems to resonating with alot of the Immigrant population

The day the republicans actually stop being racist is the day they will win like a 10-20 year period straight due to most immigrants and minorities tend to be conservative. Republicans are winning hard with Latinos."
10,v7j6x6,"While I did not necessarily agreed with some of Boudin's policies, DA's effect on crime rates seem dubious to me and his recall seems more convenient than to address the more serious issues affecting SF."
11,v7j6x6,"I don’t hold ill will against Boudin, but he has a duty to follow and enforce the California Penal Code and California Criminal Law. Agree or disagree, we will follow exactly what is written in California law. No more. No less. Equal justice under the law."
12,v7j6x6,So proud of the Asian American community for criminalizing being black and/or homeless in SF. Super great job we're doing with the optics
13,v7j6x6,He looks so sad I almost feel sorry
0,swi5gr,"Todd joined in the planning with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) led by John Lewis, and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) led by Martin Luther King, Jr.

Even fifty years later, Todd remembers clearly what he heard yelled from the sidelines as he marched in the crowd in Selma, Alabama.

""Oh wow, even the J*ps are here.""

During their push for redress, Black politicians, including the late Rep. [Ron Dellums](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Ron_Dellums.jpg) and the Congressional Black Caucus, were also integral to the redress movement, said traci kato-kiriyama, an artist and organizer with the group Nikkei Progressives. In his historic testimony on the House floor in 1987, Dellums recalled watching his childhood friend, who was Japanese American, being taken away from his home.

“This Black American cries out as loudly as my Asian American brothers and sisters on this issue,” Dellums said, urging Congress not to strip key provisions from the Civil Liberties Act."

Demonstrating unity with other people of color and the many White folks who've been protesting against police brutality and racism by supporting them with sustenance is somehow divisive? In what world?"
0,cjlsuf,"I think it's frankly so shocking and unexpected people don't even know how to react, especially from such an established director and coming out with 90% RT score. The mockery of Bruce's karate yell is definitely racialized, if it was a mockery of somebody's foreign accent it would be more easily seen as offensive. But it's the exact same thing. Most people are not good at recognizing offensive portrayals of Asian people."
1,cjlsuf,"I’m still shocked by the people defending the movies portrayal of Bruce Lee, hopefully Shannon’s experiences can help them understand that we didn’t miss the point of the film. It was just in bad taste and in my opinion teetering towards racism."
2,cjlsuf,">“Given how sympathetic Tarantino’s portrayal of Steve McQueen, Jay Sebring, and Sharon Tate is, I’m surprised he didn’t afford the same courtesy to Lee, the only non-white character in the film...”

Is he the ONLY non-white character?? Wow, really? I wasn’t planning on seeing this anyway but that’s gross."
3,cjlsuf,Unpopular Opinion: I actually don't enjoy Tarantino movies that much.
4,cjlsuf,"From what I’m hearing it seems like Lee’s portrayal wasn’t intentionally written to be mocking, but non-Asian audiences certainly took it that way and cheered on gladly. 

So at this point all I have to say is, does the intent matter anymore? When the difference in effect is basically negligible? It becomes irrelevant."
5,cjlsuf,I can't believe people are defending it. It was a mockery plain and simple. Disappointed in Tarantino. A movie that claims to love hollywood mocked one of hollywood most prominent asian icons.
6,cjlsuf,"Way to put down a legend. It's obvious Tarantino yearns for the ""good old days"" of Hollywood - Racism, Sexism, and white supremacy. It's not cowboys and Indians anymore, buddy. The world is far more complex."

8,cjlsuf,"We probably need a remake of Dragon, a Bruce Lee story.  That movie succeeded probably in no small part because Lauren Holly as Linda was the natural ""White Copilot"" many POC actors needed."
9,cjlsuf,[removed]
10,cjlsuf,"Isn't the whole point of the film set in the eye of an unreliable narrator?

I love Bruce Lee too, but that scene was meant to be exaggerated for a reason. It really tells you how unreliable the protagonist's memories are."
11,cjlsuf,I'm confused as I thought the fight itself was more of a dream/daydream sequence of what Cliff thought might happen.
12,cjlsuf,"i watched after reading these comments. i actually laughed a fair amount during the scene too but i wouldn’t say it was so much laughing at the character as at the stupidity of the whole situation which i think the movie itself wouldn’t disagree with. so can’t say for sure all the laughter was purely racism. i agree this character really had nothing to do with the bruce i have been personally learning about. so for me it really doesn’t offend me because i think it really has nothing to do with bruce lee or even asians. it was kind of more a sequence by the auteur to develop the stuntman character in the film. however i think the disappointing part is no one really ever has a chance to learn about the real bruce lee because hollywood is dominated by people who don’t really know. i don’t think it’s their fault or they don’t want to know, they just can’t help but not know what they don’t. it’s always gonna be a chicken or egg, so hard to put that on people who don’t know to accomplish that."
13,cjlsuf,"I think that it's worth keeping in mind that you are seeing a depiction of Bruce Lee in the context of a **flashback** in the mind of the character Cliff. Cliff is seeing this guy who he (the character Cliff) perceives to be cocky, a guy who is claiming that he would destroy Muhammad Ali. Cliff doesn't care for Bruce Lee, and we are seeing how Cliff perceives him. I believe that if Tarantino were to attempt to represent Bruce Lee in an objective fashion with intent for it to be accurate to reality, that depiction would not come off in such a fashion."
14,cjlsuf,"So I was under the impression this whole scene was imaginary; made up in Cliffs mind. We already saw a brief glimpse of the characters racially insensitive side when he said “don’t cry in front of the Mexicans.”

That scene didn’t actually happen, at least IMO. It’s Dalton playing it out in his head and seeing what he believes would happen. In what movie would a Western stunt double be waiting around in a tux? None. It’s a made up scene with Cliff making himself feel superior to the legend. 

We literally see Bruce later as the endearing stunt coordinator who helped Sharon get her moment in that theatre, they literally hugged and we saw her gleefully experience the scene. 

Though I am betting a little bit of the writing is based on stuff he probably actually said. I’d bet money that Cassius Clay stuff is based on stuff he probably said to someone. That felt way too specific to not be a little nod to something.

My gut says that scene wasn’t a flashback, and was imaginary. Cliff giving himself an excuse not to camp out at Ricks set looking for work."

Let’s not forget Tarantino has been known for this. I respect many Asians here want to improve our problems here but the truth is you guys over exaggerate tons of this shit. For sure I rather be Asian than a black and Latino American. Also btw this Bruce lee shit doesn’t bother me cause a lot of Asians like me are Filipinos, Indians, Japanese,etc. it’s annoying the Asians that always cry are Chinese and Koreans who probably never been to their parents home country."

I was the only Asian in my grade. The Asians in the other grades were scared too and did not support each other out of fear.At the time, I wished I was born a different race. Over time to fit in with the Latinos, I acted out(did some thangs) and they invited me to join their gang. I still feel guilt to this day that I felt shame because I am Korean.

3,m9esun,"Then there's the other situation. I went to school in Honolulu and my high school had a student body predominantly of Asian kids.  There were a handful of White students.  One was a blond, blue-eyed guy who sat next to me in practically all our classes as we were sat alphabetically.  He was harassed constantly by the other students.  I found myself defending him a lot as I found him to be a decent, intelligent guy with no bigotry in him.   I was tagged a Haole-lover for that.  His father was in the military stationed in Honolulu and they were reassigned to another military post on the Mainland US shortly after high school graduation and I never saw him again.

Much of the cost increases in higher ed have been driven by an explosion of administrator pay as well.

0,ca8vs7,aaaaAAAAAAh!!!! The live action film seems to be more of a Wuxia take on the animated film. Although I'm gonna miss Mushu and Crickee. Also did they give Mulan a sister??? Where's grandma????
1,ca8vs7,"Cinematography looks pretty good. Overall seems different than the original Mulan, but it seems like a different and fresh take. I’m looking forward to it"
2,ca8vs7,"I'm excited! 

Also, don't look at the r/movies thread for this trailer. Most of the comments are asking why there isn't a black person in this or random comments about Sichuan sauce...

EDIT: That thread just got locked because of all the racist comments that were being made."
3,ca8vs7,I have not been excited about any of these live action Disney remakes. But this one? Holy shit!!!
4,ca8vs7,"I really wish  it wasn't Crystal Liu being cast as Mulan. I've seen her in both the 2006 Return of the Condor Heroes and the 2003 Demi Gods and Semi Devils, I'll give her a pass for being XLN in Return because that character is supposed to be mostly emotionless, but I've never been a fan of her acting. She is a capable dancer and I think will do well in fight choreo, but to carry a movie as a headliner, I'm skeptical."
5,ca8vs7,"The guy who plays Mulan's love interest, Yoson An, has less than 5,000 followers on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/yosonosoy/) right now. Guess it will increase a lot today."

7,ca8vs7,"Looks better than I could have hoped for.

But is anyone else having trouble with the fact some characters speak English with an American accent, while others speak it with a Chinese accent? Kind of a weird disconnect for me."

9,ca8vs7,"I am still not convinced that lead can act.

Nothing in that trailer showed anything beyond the emotional range of a potato.  Which sucks because I'm thrilled with literally every other actor in the trailer."
10,ca8vs7,"Looks nice but idk, the English dialogue seems awkward to me. As if they’re straddling the line between preserving the contemporary cultural values of the original animated Disney vs. trying out a Hollywood facsimile of ‘ancient Chinese gravitas’ but not really doing either all that well. Maybe I’m not the intended audience."
11,ca8vs7,"Pretty sold on the trailer. I've been out of the loop with the whole shang situation recently but let's just hope that has been fixed. Everything else looks pretty good tho especially all the badass Mulan parts.

My body is ready!"
12,ca8vs7,"serious question; do the costume and set design look historically accurate? I don't know enough about the period and would like to think they didn't just appropriate this and that from disparate asian cultures.  
If anyone can enlighten me, thanks! :)"
13,ca8vs7,"I dislike all of these Disney remakes, but the Wuxia aspect is intriguing."
14,ca8vs7,Was Mulan always Hakka in the original movie and the story it was based on?
15,ca8vs7,"I think some fans are pissed this is closer to an actual war film.  In no small part thanks to Disney for somehow disguising the fact that Mulan personally (part of the princess line) killed more people than the Terminator, Robocop, and Rambo out together."
16,ca8vs7,omg my queen yifei hell yeah
17,ca8vs7,"This reminds me of those old historical Chinese/Hong Kong films my relatives used to put on TV when I was a kid. I was skeptical about this not being a musical, but I think I can change my opinion based off of this trailer."

21,ca8vs7,"The display of the Hakka Houses (the round fort) is quite interesting. It seems the story was set in the First Hakka Migration during the Western Jin Dynasty.

&#x200B;

The story of Mulan originates from a folklore from the Southern and Northern Dynasty, which includes Western Jin. Obviously, Disney has done their homework to make sure everything is culturally accurate and solid - so no more Samurai or weird Qing Dynasty hairstyle here.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now I'm really looking forward to this."
22,ca8vs7,I was very pleased with it. Still remember the first time I watched the cartoon with my sister. It looks like it appeals to both eastern and western cinema.
23,ca8vs7,I hope there’s some decent humor.

""It is my duty, to... Defeat the huns🎶🎶"""
26,ca8vs7,"Should have gotten Justin Lin to direct. But I looked at the cast and they got Jet Li, Donnie Yen, and Jason Scott Lee casted, pretty cool!"
27,ca8vs7,"The teaser doesn't look bad, but I've already read the casting call and have a feeling this is going to suck.  I really, really don't want Mulan to be another Rey...  I prefer the Mulan who has to grow in skill and work for the recognition she comes to have by the film's end.

&#x200B;

Casting call for Mulan:

 to  play 18, must be able to speak fluent English and Mandarin Chinese,  lithe, athletic, quick, tougher than she looks, Mulan lives in rural  China in 630 AD, and her country is besieged, under attack by the  Gokturk invaders, when her aging father volunteers to join the Army,  Mulan sneaks out by night and takes his place, strapping down her  breasts so she can pass for a man, there is a mysterious power inside  Mulan, a power of speed and coordination and sheer force that places her  at the peak of her unit- where no one suspects her secret.

Ethnicity: All Ethnicities

Required Media: Headshot/Photo

&#x200B;

Casting call for Chen:

 in  his 20s, must be able to speak fluent English and Mandarin Chinese,  strapping, cocky and handsome, Honghui is another recruit who joins  Commander Tung’s unit, and he’s determined to be the best soldier in  human history, full of himself, with a mean, bullying stream to him, he  quickly realizes that Mulan is his chief rival, but he does not realize  that she is a woman, grittily determined to be simply the best at  everything, Honghui is increasingly peeved by Mulan’s ability to match  or out-maneuver him, but after learning that his rival is a woman, his  intense feelings of rivalry turn into something very different,  something like love.

After his audition for The New Christy Minstrels, he did not hear back from them for a few weeks. When they called him back, they explained the delay was because they had to clear him with the show's producers, since he would be the only non-white person in the group.

Larry went to watch the Association while they were in the San Francisco Bay Area to get a feel for their music, but after the bass player injured his fingers in a firecracker accident, Jules Gary Alexander asked Larry to go on as the lead guitarist with a few hours' notice. Ramos learned the chords after listening to the band's two albums for two hours. As a member of The Association, he had to confront suspicious whites when groups toured the South. 

He reunited with the surviving members of the Association in 1979 as its leader. His brother, Del Ramos, will take over leadership of the group.

1,ng6205,Thank you for Linsanity and inspiring next generation of Asian American players. Also for that sick burn on K-Mart lel
2,ng6205,"He's got so much to be proud of. Even making a 10 year career at the highest levels of pro basketball is an accomplishment, I'd argue that Lin's impact on the game, its fans, and the world around basketball has been outsized. Not just for his advocacy but also for some of the shots he took and made. 

Not many people can claim status as the patron saint of ""asian-american guys obsessed with pickup basketball"" and as a member of that cohort, i'm so grateful that J. Lin showed that we belong on the floor. (And I think it's remarkable/important that J. Lin is Asian-American--not that I don't love Yao Ming or Yi Jian Lian but it's different)"
3,ng6205,"Yeah, as predicted the dude wasn't going to get a fair shot. He's an older PG though who had injuries in the past. He deserved a shot but the NBA is more like a lottery when it comes to a certain level of players."
4,ng6205,"I feel for him because he was never given a fair shake in the NBA: from the league, from other players, and from some ""fans"" of the game. I hate that from his last post he posted ""I didn't get it done"" and that he feels that way but I feel that he did more than he realizes. How many young Asian kids saw him during his Linsanity run or even just seeing his face on TV and thought ""He looks like me. I can do that!"", we'll never know. Living in NYC during that time, it was **electric** and there was a buzz among the Asian community. I still remember Chinatown Ice Cream Factory selling out of his shirts and it just felt like everyone was talking about him. I was really hoping he'd get called up by the Warriors (I think he deserved playing time over the rookie Manion), but it never happened. If this truly is it for him in the NBA, I think he had a good career. Maybe not in the record books but for what he did for the game outside of them."
5,ng6205,"Posted this in the other thread that was up  but I was really hoping to see him play at least once in an NBA game. Sigh... I'm super cut up and sad about this news.  

Most fun I had watching basketball was probably that 2015-2016 season. Following Lin on the Hornets, and then the 73-9 warriors team. 

I wonder when the next Asian-American baller is gonna pop on up? Even when it does happen, I don't think it'll have the same type of magic that Linsanity captured. It was literally insane."
6,ng6205,"I'm not denying JLin did -- and certainly still does -- face a lot of stereotyping in the league, but people are forgetting his really bad injury history: meniscus during Linsanity, the patella and hamstring stuff in Brooklyn. He did look great in ATL, bad in TOR, good in China, good in the G-league, but if you're a GM, you probably want to opt for someone with less of a serious injury history -- and who is younger. A lot of the teams that also have room for a PG are capped out."

2,lbew0v,"Black on Asian crimes in big cities have always been an issue since ages ago. However, mentioning it is somehow racist against Black people. It’s so sad to think that this will be swept under the rug by most people, including the Asians who fought so hard for George Floyd. Asians are so hard working and contribute so much to the American society but we constantly get ignored and even punished for working hard with things like violent crimes, affirmative actions, etc. It baffles me that mainstream media and social media constantly told Asians that we’re a part of the problem during BLM when in reality, we’re more victimized than most races."

Recruit Black and Latinx allies from outside of Asian American community (this only works if you helped out THOSE friends during BLM like I did), make it clear you're not pretending we have it the worse, just want safety for our own families.  Contrary to what white supremacy tells us, I find that they are able to empathize with me better than most Asian Americans (since they experience oppression as a matter of human suffering that must be resolved than something that's debated academically).  Unfortunately, many of our own will care too much about saying the right words than doing the right things that will not only actually help us, but also other marginalized communities as well.

3,d231ae,"This has been on my mind for a while now. 

Chinese-American girl chiming in here. When I was younger and so naive, I didn’t see a problem with being a “model minority”. I thought it was a good thing. I didn’t realize until much later that that concept just pits all minorities against one another. It’s dangerous how insidious that concept is. My family was also rampant with white supremacy. My own mother would talk down about other Asians (specifically Chinese and Indian people) in the Bay Area and how there are “too many of them”. I pointed out that she, myself, and her then unborn granddaughter are one of the ones just taking up too much space, so what does that mean? 🤨

Racism towards Black people is prevalent for sure in my family. I feel like I don’t have the vocabulary in Cantonese to really discuss this with them. It also doesn’t help that most of them are horrible listeners to begin with and also don’t think that the younger generation has anything insightful to offer. 

I’m doing my best to educate myself on Asian-American history. I’m currently reading The Making of Asian-America by Erika Lee. I see now that Asians are privileged but it’s all part of an ugly system that only serves white supremacy. My former coworker who is a middle aged Japanese-Chinese-Hawaiian lady told me super matter-of-factly that “Asians are basically white.”  I died a little that day! 😵🤢"
4,d231ae,"It’s a little easier for me personally — my parents are pretty well-assimilated Chinese-American immigrants who don’t let their frustration over affirmative action affect their views on other racially sensitive issues *that* much, and I have to usually have to consult Google Translate to put Chinese characters in my writing.

But in general, yeah: Asian-American communities — and perhaps Chinese communities in particular — do tend to be pretty ethnocentric, and I’ve personally heard “那个地方没有黑人” (“That place has no black people”) or a very close variation (with the 👍 implied) on at least half a dozen occasions among my grandparents and their friends.

There’s definitely a large and heartening generational gap, though: second-generation Asian-Americans on down generally grow up in a pluralistic environment where interacting with those of varying melanin concentrations doesn’t cause one to faint on sight."
5,d231ae,"Yeah I agree with you on the part about Asians who really only care when it negatively impact Asian people. Some Asians can be really racist against black and hispanic people, even other asians like indians. I generally don't really hang around with those crowd though. 

In terms of others understanding racism against Asians, it can be tough to discuss because racism against black and hispanics are more obvious and severe where as racism against asians are more subtle and can be written off as ""maybe you just thought he/she was being racist to you""."
6,d231ae,"I like how this has 50 upvotes and few comments so I'll throw my two cents. 

Non-Asian here. Graduated from college in LA with a liberal arts degree and took a handful of classes on race/ethnicity. 

I do remember discussions of internment camps during WWII, Asians as a model minority, and a legal case, People v. Hall. BUT the two classes on race/ethnicity focused a ton on African Americans. I loved those classes but I felt like I didn't know enough about my own people so I took a Latinx studies and California Indians class.  

When you're a minority, I feel like you have to go out of your way to learn about your people. Not sure if others feel the same. Even if you're black, you'll probably only learn about the African American experience. Unfortunately, I didn't learn much about the Asian diaspora in college.  

That's why I follow this subreddit to learn more. I'm also a fan of [/r/blackfellas](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blackfellas/). Not sure where my people are at... probably too busy with memes on /r/latinopeopletwitter"
7,d231ae,Racism comes in many flavors. Too bad we can’t taste them all huh.
8,d231ae,"In the 1950s-1960s when I moved from Hawaii to the East Coast of the Mainland US, I ran into a whole lot of racism in the form of discriminations as to what businesses I could do business with whether they were restaurants, movie theaters, department stores etc etc.  I was in the military in the 1950s and remember once going to a very popular amusement park in Maryland along with a few of my White buddies.  They were allowed into the park but I was barred from entering.  My buddies demanded refunds of their admission tickets if I wasn't allowed in.  We all left the park.  I was even barred from entering a church for Sunday services.  It got so that I simply refused to go into town to do business except to go to Chinatowns for meals and sundry purchases.  I still reside in the same area after all these years and there are absolutely no barriers to encounter when doing business anywhere in the state."
9,d231ae,There are even some users in this subreddit who will dismiss racist microaggressions against Asians and seem to bring up oppression olympics when it comes to other POC.
10,d231ae,"I feel the same. Pretty much given up at this point. I'll discuss it with some Asian coworkers from time to time if I feel like they are ""woke"""
11,d231ae,Asians side with whites people. That’s our whole deal now
12,d231ae,Where do you live?
13,d231ae,"I always remind to my fellow Filipinos and other minorities that the freedoms that we're taking for granted here in the USA was fought by mostly African-Americans and sympathetic Caucasians.  There were other minority activities of course, but not as large and influential as African-Americans did to pave the way for the rest of us."

16,d231ae,"Between the massive amounts of wealth circulating among us and the sheer amount of antiblackness and misogyny in Asian communities sometimes it’s hard even for me to give a shit when someone gets barred from something or discriminated against. Like past a certain point it isn’t a disenfranchised group against the system, it’s just two apex predators duking it out. 

The fact that most AA “activists” only seem to be in on this for money, fame, or chicks doesn’t help make the conversations more meaningful or even entertaining."

Night Shyamalan; and, well, Paul Giamatti — an idea that particularly tickled \[Randall\] Park. “I thought that would be really funny,” says Park. “But Ali was like, ‘No, that’s not the direction I want to go in.’” 

Tony Leung is so fine. I could get behind that. But yikes at the optics of casting Paul Giamatti -- Randall, bby, why?? So glad that Ali pushed for her vision:

>“**It was very important to me that it be someone who was Asian-American who would also be Marcus’s worst nightmare,” explains \[Ali\] Wong.** “Because if Daniel Dae Kim” — Sasha’s fiancé in the beginning of the film — “showed up, you’d be like, *Ahh!* if you were Marcus. It’s got to be even worse than that. So it’s got to be someone who’s internationally iconic, and someone who fits those two Venn diagrams is basically Keanu Reeves.”

Her being a native Korean, we watch a lot of Korean dramas/variety shows/movies together. And as much as I love watching them, I can't help but always feel some sort of disconnect; little nuances and subtleties that I'll never get as a Korean-American. So getting to watch a movie about Asian-Americans in a completely relatable story has me giddy."
7,bv8344,Keanu Reeves being Chinese-Hawaiian makes a lot of sense. No wonder he has an affinity for more martial arts heavy roles. It’s him exploring and honoring his heritage. He takes those roles very seriously. That’s pretty cool to me.

9,bv8344,"Is Keanu Reeves half Japanese too? Or was he just cast to play a role that was made up to be included in an adaptation of a story about 47 ronin none of whom were Chinese or white? Is taking that role the kind of thing a person who represents Asians would do?

I don’t hate Keanu Reeves. But I have a difficult time accepting someone who would take that role as a representative of Asian men in acting. If actions speak louder than words that seems like a very loud action."

5,hip3mz,"I should have gotten into an argument about my experience... It wasn’t directly with a stranger but me (Chinese-American) being used as a token for my ex in a situation he was in.
My white ex had trouble at the beginning of one of his more difficult classes, and he was actively trying to get on better terms with the white male prof who was kind of stoic and not very friendly. One day, that prof had mentioned his Thai wife. So my ex went to this guy’s office hours to sort of talk class and casually, and he somehow used that minuscule bridge of relatability of having as Asian female partner. They joked about how “we” spend a lot of time and energy “taking care of them.” Like how we were “obsessed” with cooking and cleaning... “for them.” The truth was that my ex was lazy and made excuses about not keeping his new apartment clean and trying to maintain a healthy and conscious diet. I thought it was school that was tiring him out, but I was managing attending university full-time better than he was, so I took it upon myself to be the “supporting girlfriend.”
I should have taken that as a big red flag. I didn’t speak up for myself when he told me that. I’m Chinese-American, born and raised in a very white and rather affluent Midwest suburb. That conversation of two white men talking about their “coddling Asian women partners” was racist, and I wish I knew what I know now to have identified that. It was ignorant to the diversity and global phenomenon that is “Asian,” and it was incredibly misogynistic to me and that guy’s wife. They basically succumbed to this toxic idea that submissiveness is inherent in Asian women. Disgusting and false. I should have been angry, but at the time, I didn’t know any better. I think I said something along the lines of, “that’s interesting...”

TL;DR - if you’re a WOC token of conversation your partner uses you to “relate” to others “like them” by generalizing your “personality”/relationship to them, speak up and BREAK UP."
6,hip3mz,"Edit: also just wanted to say that, your situation totally sucks and I think you dealt with it as best you could. Sorry you had to deal with that

Not an argument but have been in conversations where the other person jumps to asking me about my Asian heritage and background. It makes me uncomfortable because I don't if they have ""yellow fever"" or are obsessed with Asian culture or genuinely getting to know ME first and not my heritage. I'm happy to talk about my heritage but not if I get weird creep vibes from someone. I guess you could say I'm pessimistic about people's intentions but that's ok with me because they are definitely creepy people out there. 

For example, I was sitting with my (white) husband outside on a patio area at an indoor/outdoor museum awhile ago and we were approached by an older couple (maybe 50s). He was white and explained that his wife was from China (they recently got married I think). And proceeded to encourage me to ""talk to her in Chinese"", which was really awkward for me because (a) how can he assume I knew mandarin and (b) my primary language is English and (c) my mandarin is about as good as my neuroscience knowledge (which is practically zero). The whole time he had this vibe of ""you're Chinese too so you can talk to my wife"". We basically sat there in silence as her husband seemed to force conversation on us. Maybe one of the most racist and awkward moments in my life."

Back in college and at work it’s entirely very easy but online seems especially challenging. I just enjoy chatting with people from everywhere but I realize there is so much distrust in general.

Edit: People “fetishize” other races based on what’s happening in popular culture especially in movies. With that said some will ask inappropriate questions which may seem ignorant like when Slum Dog Millionaire came out. Same with the Korean Parasite movie. But nothing excuses the examples listed here."
12,hip3mz,"I totally feel you. When I was a barista at Starbucks, this drunk guy was having a problem with his credit card.

I should’ve said something more but he was totally hammered so I just let it go.

1,bmsjrq,"**Nearly half of white Republicans say it bothers them to hear people speaking foreign languages**  
By [**Christopher Ingraham**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/christopher-ingraham/)  
**May 8**

A new survey finds white Republicans are far more likely to be put off by foreign language speakers than their Democratic counterparts.

[According to Pew Research Center](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2019/05/08/americans-see-advantages-and-challenges-in-countrys-growing-racial-and-ethnic-diversity/), 47 percent of such Republicans say it would bother them “some” or “a lot” to “hear people speak a language other than English in a public place.” Eighteen percent of white Democrats said they would be similarly bothered.

Aside from politics, age and education are the major predictors of linguistic discomfort. Eighteen percent of whites younger than 30 said they would be bothered by a foreign language being spoken, compared with 43 percent in the 50-to-64 age group, and 45 percent among those 65 and older.

Among all racial groups, whites (34 percent) are most likely to be bothered hearing foreign languages, followed by blacks (25 percent), Asians (24 percent) and Hispanics (13 percent). Among Americans overall, 70 percent put their level of unease at “not much” or “not at all.”

The study follows a number of high-profile confrontations between English and Spanish speakers. Last year, a [U.S. Border Patrol agent detained two women](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2018/05/20/a-border-patrol-agent-detained-two-u-s-citizens-at-a-gas-station-after-hearing-them-speak-spanish/) — both U.S. citizens — when he overheard them speaking Spanish at a gas station in Montana. In New York, a [man launched into a rant](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2018/05/16/my-next-call-is-to-ice-watch-a-man-wig-out-because-workers-spoke-spanish-at-a-manhattan-deli/?utm_term=.c8990c19d4fa) after hearing deli workers conversing and threatened to call immigration authorities.

The United States has no official national language, although a number of states have declared English to be theirs. More than 1 in 5 U.S. residents speak a language other than English at home, according to census data. In many regions of the country the percentage is much higher than that. The data show that the majority of those foreign language speakers are also fully proficient in English, meaning they are bilingual by choice.

The new report comes on the heels of a [Pew study ](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2019/03/21/views-of-demographic-changes-in-america/)on the nation’s demographic shifts. When asked about the projected makeup of the United States in 2050, some 37 percent of Republicans said that “having a majority of the population made of up of blacks, Asians, Hispanics and other racial minorities” would be bad for the country — the highest share among any demographic group surveyed. Nearly 60 percent of Republicans said that a majority nonwhite population would “weaken American customs and values,” while an identical percentage predicted it would lead to greater conflict between racial and ethnic groups.

Republicans also stood out in that survey for their skepticism of interracial marriage: One-third said “the fact that more people of difference races are marrying each other” was good for the country, while 16 percent said it was bad.

Other questions in the latest Pew survey shine a light on what’s driving Republicans’ displeasure with foreign language speakers: For one thing, Republicans are more skeptical of racial diversity in general. Thirty-nine percent of Republican respondents said it was “very good” that “the U.S. population is made up of people of many different races and ethnicities.” Among Democrats, 71 percent hold that view, as do 57 percent of Americans overall.

More than 1 in 5 Republicans support the view that having a population comprising “people of many different races and ethnicities has a negative impact on the country’s culture.” That compares with 12 among the total population.

Meanwhile, solid majorities of every demographic group — blacks, whites, Democrats, Republicans — would prefer employers not take race into account when making hiring decisions, even if doing so resulted in less diversity within the company."
2,bmsjrq,I wonder if the Native Americans are bothered by people speaking English on their land????
3,bmsjrq,"“Bothered” reminds me of how (when I was going door to door on behalf of a Democratic candidate), and people would tell me “I just don’t trust him,” and that would be code for “I am racist.” I would ask them to provide me with more details, what is it that they don’t trust, what issues are important to them and maybe I could try to discuss with them what exactly it was, but it was always that vague response."
4,bmsjrq,"I find this both baffling and troubling. It's a blatant example of how the term White Republican has become synonymous with racist.

In large swaths of the world, speaking more than one language is the norm. It is and has been the standard for many, many areas, even if you're just counting dialects. I find that in predominantly English-speaking countries - UK, USA, NZ, AZ, CA - white people don't grow up with a second language. Canadians can kind of claim French but none of them really use it except the Quebecois, who all grow up with it. Otherwise, they are stuck speaking only English unless they study it in higher education.

In Europe, it's not uncommon to speak upwards of 3 languages. The same goes for India, China (more for its dialects), several African countries, and the Levant."
5,bmsjrq,"This would probably vary depending on what foreign language it was. If it were Spanish, Arabic or an Asian language, the Republicans would definitely disapprove. But they might feel differently about French, Italian or any other language primarily spoken by white people.

This reminds me of an incident that happened in a SF Bay Area Starbucks (Walnut Creek, I think). This young guy was teaching a young woman how to speak English and when another patron (an old white lady) heard them speaking Korean to one another, she flipped out and started screaming at them to go back to their country and accused them of talking badly of her. That's another thing, they're always convinced that people are talking shit about them in another language! So narcissistic, the world doesn't revolve them."
6,bmsjrq,"I think the fact that American is an island nation with 2 buffer zone (Mexico&Canada) play a huge part in our citizen attitude.  Where as Germans, Dane, Fin, Swedes it's very common for people to be  tri-lingual or more.  This is both out of economic and culture necessity.  In place like SEA or Africa the same thing is  true.

&#x200B;

I think one of the way to combat this is to have more celebrity showcasing their ability to speak and learning other culture and language.  Almost all of the celebrity I follow on social media are from oversea and they will often flex the fact that they are multi-lingual as a pride.  I don't see alot of Hollywood A-lister doing it here in the U.S.  It's almost like they are afraid that they would be shun if they do it."
7,bmsjrq,"Oh man this actually reminds me of when I lived in Arkansas and would witness people's faces change when they'd hear something other than English. Or oh god, the ""jokes"" people would say that were really a cover up for insecurities or something.

As an American I think I have had a somewhat unique experience of being exposed regularly to languages I didn't understand at all and therefore have grown comfortable being around people who aren't speaking my language. I'm sure this is a pretty common experience for people from NYC or other large cities with a highly diverse population but rare elsewhere. A lot of people, even bilingual people, don't feel comfortable when people start talking in a language they don't comprehend.

(Btw, calling non-English languages ""foreign"" seems super anglocentric and not very factual. I am very supportive for the move away from English being the default language in America and the move towards America becoming an English/Spanish bilingual country.)"

Apparently, being brown means that I must've come from another country...  Oh, I forgot to mention, I was born and raised in Sacramento, CA"
10,bmsjrq,This is paywalled could someone copy paste it in the commetns?
11,bmsjrq,crybabies
12,bmsjrq,what's wrong with being bilingual or polyglot? It's cool to know many languages.
13,bmsjrq,"While I'm definitely left-leaning and not a fan of the current GOP, I think the title of the article gives the impression that this is a uniquely republican phenomena, when it's really just a white phenomena. Democrats are slightly more open-minded, but are also very unnerved by hearing foreign languages.

For anyone paying attention to news outside the US, Europe has already started to fall to alt-right (Poland for example has already fallen politically to nationalists). People everywhere feel threatened by the mixing of cultures and people through globalization and refugee migration. The fear is usually irrational and exaggerated, but it's real. It pays to try and understand it beyond simple racism/hate if we want to stop the spread of alt-right beliefs. 

Any developed nation with an ethnic/cultural majority is going to feel uncomfortable and fearful of growing populations (and thus growing influence and political power) of people who are ethnically and culturally different. It can feel as if their native culture is going to be replaced (cue the Charlottesville tiki torches) by that of the immigrants. The false assumption of course is that there isn't enough space/resources for multiple cultures to co-exist."
14,bmsjrq,This is why I'm learning the language from the old country.
15,bmsjrq,lol insecure and insular. sounds right.
16,bmsjrq,How much do you want to bet that the 30% of people in this survey also are limited to a 4th grade vocabulary? I'm guessing these are not people who have taken the SAT.
17,bmsjrq,"more like it bothers them to hear people speaking foreign languages that isn't French, German, Norwegian, Czech, or whatever white European country their ancestors came from because white European immigrants who come here don't get treated the same way as POC immigrants."
18,bmsjrq,~~because it reminds them of their sheer inadequacy~~
19,bmsjrq,There's an estimated 6500 languages that exist and America's official language is NONE of them. Racists are bothered? Good. Go die mad about it.
20,bmsjrq,"As a kid I decided that I would travel and see as much of this world as I could.  So I've travelled a lot and found jobs in Europe, Africa and Asia using those jobs as the base from which to travel around nearby countries.  I also took classes in several languages in the countries where I stayed for at least a couple of years.  So I'm multi-lingual which, I suppose, would bother Republicans a whole hell of a lot.  Sorry."
21,bmsjrq,That's terrible. There's nothing wrong with speaking multiple languages if one desires to do so.
22,bmsjrq,"What's astounding to me is that when I encounter this if you really look at why people are concerned it is because they are worried the people are using the language they don't understand to talk trash about them.  As if there were no other reason why someone would want to use a language you don't speak, such as a reason that has nothing to do with you.

As a kid I learned early on that a surefire way to piss off the front office lady at my school who hated when I would speak another language, was to speak that language while glancing over at her, snickering, and then continue speaking it."
23,bmsjrq,Nearly half of Duke faculty also say it bothers them to hear people speaking foreign languages.
24,bmsjrq,"As a white American who speaks other languages, I _love_ doing this to them, especially with non-European tongues."
25,bmsjrq,Never stop talking shit about them to their faces!
26,bmsjrq,I recommend they visit Europe.
0,aztrk7,"Logically, I agree with most of your points. In fact I find I’m quite pessimistic with the prospects for race relations in america in general considering how minorities are otherized and the way general white supremacy is threaded into western civilization.

I think 2 other huge factors besides the ones you’ve brought up contribute to our disunity. First is the absence of a collective memory. That is, we immigrated in waves, so the fucked up shit that happened to Asians in the west didn’t really happen to the people we descended from. Unlike most african americans who are literally descended from slaves, asian americans in large parts have no direct connection to, for example, the chinese railroader builders. We don’t have the collective memory to contextualize the type of oppression that has been and still is being leveled against us.

Part of catching up with this is made harder by I think the second complicating factor: invisibility. It’s often not clear that we go through shit at all. Part of it is the model minority. Part of it is that we’re not known to make a fuss about things. And part of it is the complete absence of the asian-western experience in the vast majority of historical education. This invisibility makes it unclear there’s stuff that needs to be changed about our place in the west, whether it be from the outside looking in or vice versa.

All this said, I still think it’s a bit redundant to fixate on the impossibility of a united front (not that I’m saying you are). I think it’s important to be aware of, but only in the approach to ultimately pushing the needle forward. I’m totally with you worrying about asians who aren’t in the right place with their intentions, but I think it’s really a matter of either helping them along or directing my attentions elsewhere. "
1,aztrk7,"There was a web series ""Yappie"" that addresses these issues you're discussing. You're right, it's not being talked about.   
[https://youtu.be/iOntet85kBw](https://youtu.be/iOntet85kBw)"
2,aztrk7,[deleted]
3,aztrk7,"can you give some specific examples? I can't really speak to latinx experience but I think black people have just as many internal fractures, but maybe they present differently. 

And what's the ideal you're working against? Is it to have AAs agree on all issues all the time? That doesn't seem realistic to me and it's even problematic to assume we would. It's okay for us to disagree, so I'm curious to see if you could expand."
4,aztrk7,"So this will probably be an even more unpopular opinion, but I absolutely love the fact that Asians aren't unified under one voice. Asians and Asian Americans are a diverse group of people, and even though we are less populous than blacks or hispanics, we can't be corralled into becoming single issue voters. Asia is the largest continent on Earth, both in population and geographic land mass, so it would make sense that we are also the most diverse people on Earth. 

I don't think we need to agree with each other on all the issues all the time because that'll take away our individuality. "
5,aztrk7,1000% agreed. fuck the model minority trope.
6,aztrk7,"There is a great article by Iimay Ho that touches on some of.the issues you talk about in this post (the article is called Confessions of a Wealthy Immigrant). I highly recommend reading it! I also emphasize with you on this-- Asian American issues often get overlooked in Western media, if only because there are more graphic or violent cases of racism and discrimination occurring in other communities of color. That isnt discounting our marginalized experience, though. It is difficult to speak out about something that seemingly doesnt matter, but I keep thinking about the next Asian American or Asian person who feels fractured or hurt and confused about their identity, and finding the resources and support that we put out. I think that is what keeps me going. Idk"
7,aztrk7,"But do Asians themselves consider other Asians to be Asians?

I mean, Asian Americans mean just Chinese or Korean or Vietnamese etc and not really all the ethnic groups it encompasses"
8,aztrk7,"I saw a post that said east asian activism is primarily focused on feeling left out of white supremacy and doing everything they can to be apart of it. Our beef is not that the system is oppressive and we need to tear it down, but that the system is fine until it hurts us specifically. They interviewed some anti Affirmative Action Asians for a harvard case article once and a lot of the Asian genuinely thought america wasn't racist except for affirmative action. One of the criticisms of Asian American activism is that we fight for proximity to whiteness rather than  the Affirmative Action case and the peter liang case where the chinese american community are examples of this to me. a community that rarely goes to bat for any political issues got mad that Liang wasn't being treated like a white cop. Not that the police as an institution is fundamentally racist but they got mad at the idea that if a white cop did this, he would be treated better by the justice system. They weren't trying to deny Liang didn't shoot anyone, but that he should be treated like a white cop. Kinda wild considering that one of the cops that shot Stephon Clark Was black and Black Lives Matter showed up to his pre wedding dinner to confront him while recording it.  People who are passionate about asian issues are never gonna see eye to eye cause the community is split between People who think the system is fundamentally fucked up to people who are just mad they're not currently benefiting from the system and would be fine with racism towards other groups otherwise. The Liang case is such a thing for me because of how journalists really made it a point to be like ""one of the few times asians are mobilizing politically"". I think about the criticism of asian activism via ""there's a lot of talk about Diversity in Hollywood and such but issues like mass deportations of southeast asians don't get much juice"". And its kinda true. like you see the amount of posts a thread about a hot asian dude in media vs a thread about the administration deporting Cambodians and that will get posts but not nearly as much as for CRA. The community is fractured between people who care about very different issues. Often times one group will Mobilize against a specific issue and come directly into conflict with another group that is against what the first group is doing. Like everytime I read an article that's like ""One of the few times asians are mobilizing politically"" its about us uniting for the worst possible issue that usually is at odds with the black and latinx community.  Everytime we speak out it somehow will benefit whites, I can't rock with those dudes. Also I'm sure the latinx and black communities have their fractures, we're not apart of those communities so we don't know about it or know enough about the nuances of it. Like we have MRAzns they have hoteps. "

2,v3c7ov,">crustier Ben Kingsley 

How you gonna be crustier than a dude that already looks crustier than a mf. 

Good on you standing up for yourself.

I also like to hoop and have run into racist situations numerous times. I usually start by explaining what they said is racist, and to not judge all Asian people based on stereotypes. Most of the time they get it after an explanation, at the very least to my face they act fine, but sometimes you really gotta put your foot down like you did here.

What city are you in btw? Philly I'm guessing since no one else says jawn lol."
3,v3c7ov,"Wasn’t there a trend of like making videos or sharing stories about white people in Asian countries being “discriminated” against because Asian people apparently insisted speaking in English to them. I think there was a video which included a an Asian American who only knew English but was being spoken to in Japanese. I guess it’s to help illustrate some point that white people are the REAL oppressed people? As if a) Asian Nationals wouldn’t understand the concept of Asian diaspora (they do) or Asian Americans and b) AsAms don’t deal with a completely different set of struggles when they travel abroad.

I wouldn’t be surprised if this guy is living out this crazy fantasy in his head. He thinks this experience was some kind of example of Asian people discriminating against white people. In reality, the entire situation is reversed. He feels entitled than you should validate him by speaking in the language HE wants, and because YOU’RE Asian, YOU have to speak in an Asian language.

Unfortunately it’s… I guess not *uncommon* to see white men turning situations where Asian people are treated badly around to somehow being about them and how everyone is being racist to them. It’s almost a talent really."
4,v3c7ov,"I was working on a film set in a scene that was mostly Asian. The extras that had speaking roles spoke broken Mandarin and couldn’t deliver the lines naturally and that caught the director off guard because they were older. They explained they were 3rd/4th generation and mostly spoke English. The writer on set, who is Chinese American, quickly re wrote it so the extras line were in English, which still made since because it was set in San Francisco. 
You never can tell who speaks what."
5,v3c7ov,"My sibling and I are ABC, but rarely speak Mandarin to each other except around our parents or primarily Mandarin-speaking family. Why? Because English is way easier for us in most cases.

I've also hung out with a mixed group of native and diaspora Taiwanese, and the language would flow in whatever direction was most comfortable depending on who was talking to who. 

It's super awkward to insist on steering the language of a conversation in a particular direction without just saying something like ""hey, I prefer to speak in X language for this reason"". This guy probably could have saved himself a ton of grief by just saying ""hey, I'd like to practice my Mandarin if that's okay with you"", and then accepting your answer one way or the other."
6,v3c7ov,"Ewww he honestly sounds like a fetishizer who views the Asian people around him as props to make himself feel superior. Creepy as hell, as an AA woman I avoid dudes like this like the plague"

10,v3c7ov,Would normally never believe these kind of stories if only it wasn't so common. Some white guys make having an Asian wife and being an ambassador to her culture their whole personality.

12,v3c7ov,"Gross. I hate it when the whites gatekeep our experiences as AAs. If English is what you’re comfortable with and prefer to speak to him, you shouldn’t have to justify your reasons to anyone. Sounds also like he has a bit of a identity crisis too, bordering on Sino-philia. Double gross."

14,v3c7ov,"The opposite end of the ""This is America. Learn to speak English."" It's not about the language. It's someone trying to impose their will on someone else."

My dad is a white dude who used to worked as a translator. He is fluent in Mandarin, Japanese, and Korean. You will never hear him boasting about it in public places. 

Hell, my Chinese mom would be the one encouraging him to use an Asian language, almost flauntingly, whenever we are at a restaurant or interacting someone who spoke Chinese/Korean/Japanese. I remember him being pretty shy and reserved about it, but would eventually do it. He never came off as a weird ass creep like the guy in the story tho."
16,v3c7ov,"lmao this old white guy on the bus that used to work in china told me his whole got dang story about his life and how he used to live in china and how Filipino people are so nice to him and I'm just like, ""okay buddy."" and idk he's just a white dude that lived in china forever and never had to learn chinese lmao now he's back in the states and not everyone likes him and blah blah whatever dude. 

idk I was tired from work, so I just let him say whatever racist ass shit he wanted to say lol he literally only started talking to me bc I offered a seat, not even my seat, to someone that was carrying a lot of bags. You show the smallest amount of kindness to anyone and these kind of white folks expect the same from you to them.

So tired lol so sad."

20,v3c7ov,Everyone always talks about reganmian when you're from Hubei but nobody ever talks about the ou tang. Hubei lotus root is the best around istg.

26,v3c7ov,"What a weird position for him to take. I’m really trying to empathize with him, just to make sense of the situation. Did he expect the fobs to speak mandarin with him? Did they speak English to him by default?"
27,v3c7ov,He wants to fit in. He probably wants to practice his Chinese. That's awesome that he's so cross cultural and clearly speaks the language. I do see it's frustrating for him to want to be seen as a Chinese speaker but to not be treated as one. But... all he had to do was ask to speak in Chinese instead of passively forcing a conversation.
28,v3c7ov,He felt intimidated by you and wanted to test you by crossing the line and seeing how much he can get away with by disrespecting you. It’s good you stood your ground. Next time avoid scums like him at all costs.

0,uicc0c,"It’s a supply and demand issue.  Nigel and Steven He can speak perfect English with no accent, and have done so in the past on their YouTube channels, but received no significant views.  

They put on the clown hat and then all the views start coming as they normalize “foreign Asians speaking in funny accents.” 

It’s a systemic issue that stems from the very cultural identity of western countries."
1,uicc0c,"On a top game show where you answer questions to get a million dollars, the Asian contestant introduced himself and had a western American accent. The host was startled and said , "" I didnt expect that from you"" the Asian contested looked uncomfortable and said, "" well thats where I was raised. I had this accent my whole life"".

 The whole crowd broke out in laughter. Yes asians being joke fodder is so wrong and tiring.we need to say, "" This is not ok"""
2,uicc0c,"I have similar feelings about Ken Jeong's characters. While I support Asian actors, it feels like some non-asian viewers ""like"" him because his characters fit into the negative stereotype. We need more characters like Simu Liu's Shang Chi, Henry Golding's Nick, Tom, Jessica Henwicks' bugs..."
3,uicc0c,"The London accent is considered ""posh"",  the French accent is considered ""romantic"", and some other accents are considered ""sexy"" ... but the Asian accent is considered "" laughable""."
4,uicc0c,"I just find it weird when Asians who don't have an accent make jokes by mocking Asians who do have an accent. Feels like punching down on people, especially your own people"
5,uicc0c,"It's a tricky thing and reminds me of the old situation dave chappelle faced with his show.   If I'm with my Asian friends or back in Hong Kong with my childhood homies, then it's all good.  Because it's contextually appropriate, whether I'm doing an exaggerated accent to impersonate my parents or dip into a very passionate aeeiyah, as we HK-ers do.



It's when the audience is broader that morons think it gives them license to do the same or—and this is where the Chappelle reference comes in—the question arises internally: Are they laughing *at* me or *with* me? Do they have the context to even laugh with me?"
6,uicc0c,"I like how comedian Henry Cho has gone with the angle of being an Asian American with a southern accent, and what that meant when he was visiting Korea and White tourist asked for directions using Western pidgin-speak."
7,uicc0c,"Out of all the most prominent Asian voices, I think Ronny Chieng's is the most accented - but even then, it's quite American sounding.

Part of it is the Western-Eastern poshness thing, as others suggested, but I also think it's about the contexts that Asian accents are heard in. Accents can be associated with a wide variety of things - geographical origin, obviously, but also social class, occupations, familiarity. We laugh at Uncle Roger because his accent is familiar to Chinese diaspora (we hear our uncles and aunties talking that way and about similar things) and it's a good impression. But for non-Asians they tend to encounter those accents through interactions with recent immigrants occupying particular (often lower) positions in society, and so when they laugh it feels like punching down.

I struggle with code-switching myself. I generally have a watered-down Asian accent that I use when I talk to Asians, but when I talk to non-Asian Americans I find myself talking in a much more white American way. I find it funny when I do impressions in a strong Chinese accent, but I also find it funny when I do impressions of stereotypical American accents (like Valley Girl or East Coast accents). Perhaps we just need more people making fun of all accents equally?"
8,uicc0c,"There's just gotta be something smarter and better than JUST using our accents to bring about comedic commentary on our experiences as Asian Americans. I just find accents to be such low hanging fruit, especially if it's your main shtick. I liked watching this German guy channel who speaks perfect English and German but makes lots of videos as a German person with an accent that funnily show the differences between German culture and American culture. The accent is authentic and it definitely adds so much to the character but I'm never laughing at him because his accent is ""funny"" it's the cultural differences that are the focus. 

It's hard a line to toe for us since our accents have historically been the brundt of the joke for decades."
9,uicc0c,"I don't think the accent thing is bad in any way. Racist people are gonna be racist, and it's not because of the accent, they are just racist or hateful.

I get it a lot of people grew up in non Asian countries and get bullied because of their accent or their parents accent or even the food we ate.

Besides a lot of people in Asia dig the accent because they can relate with it."
10,uicc0c,I find Steven He annoying as hell because of his constant accent jokes. EmOtIoNaL dAmAgE.
11,uicc0c,"Nigel Ng has addressed this in a LADBible interview on YouTube. His point is basically that the accent is largely authentic - there is nothing derogatory or demeaning about it. Many Asians including myself find his Uncle Roger character hilarious because we see ourselves or our relatives in it. But the other point is that nothing that Nigel ever says as Uncle Roger puts down Asian culture - in fact, he celebrates and elevates it."
12,uicc0c,"Accents identify, but it's the content that matters.

Look at Trevor Noah before he sold out, he uses accents plenty but the accents are never associated with content that is derogatory towards race. Eg 'you want some tacos' vs 'have you *ever had* AIDS'

Specifically, OP is tired of people using Asian accents to identify a negative portrayal of Asians.

This distinction is important because otherwise it is easy for critics to claim we're being overly sensitive and cite examples (eg Trevor Noah) on how accents can be used without problems."
13,uicc0c,This better include Indian accents; I was none too pleased to find a trending sound on tiktok being started by an East Asian. We can’t be hurting each other like this.
14,uicc0c,"I'm actually annoyed at their content cuz of the fake Asian content. Problem is a lot of Asians support them. It's probably no surprise that their audiences are primarily Asian but support for their ""jokes"" have definitely shot up from other race demos."
15,uicc0c,"> Because they're not laughing at the jokes, they're laughing at us.

Based"
16,uicc0c,"I think it’s fine for Asian comedians to use it as material when the content is expressly for an Asian audience. In some ways it’s refreshing because for so long we were outsiders and always the butt end of jokes. The accent is part of the material, whereas before mostly white mostly male comedians used it as the material itself. I can laugh at Jo Koy making light of Asians using our fingers to measure making rice. I can laugh at Russell Peters taking about the interactions between Chinese and Indian deal makers. That said, there is definitely a fine line, and after you reach an larger mainstream audience the question becomes one of responsibility.

If we look at Asians in media, and the historical struggles trying to get decent roles, we can see a clear trajectory of how we are treated and seen. It goes back to the history of media itself. (Anna May Wong was too Chinese to be cast as a Chinese lead in a movie, like wtf?) The Problem with Apu” is a great documentary that touches upon when white people decide to use accents as a joke, and the pervasiveness of racism in the industry. 

Personally I have less of an issue with someone like Nigel Rogers who uses an exaggerated accent in context to gain an audience, (and then used his platform to promote Asian businesses and YouTubers) than someone like Rob Schneider who as a Filipino puts on slanted eyes and buck teeth in movies for laughs.

Also wanted to add that not everything we do is for white consumption."
17,uicc0c,"Uncle roger is so cringe, and the fact that he has 'risen' at all is really telling of how non-Asian people think of us and the level of racism they tolerate."
18,uicc0c,Jo Koy is probably the most guilty of this bullshit
19,uicc0c,"I think it depends how it's done. If I see an Asian comedian overuse it, then I just see it as low tier joke. 

I love Russel Peters and he nails some accents down, at least to my ear. His Chinese accent is something very relatable to me, and he goes all over the place with accents, and doesn't just focus on one.

But then I see hot trash like Uncle Roger and I cringe. I am very split on this. If that's your entire shtick, then it's lame, but I think there is time and place for it. I mean I sometimes do a Canto accent with my friends for fun, and we aren't necessarily mocking our culture.

It seemed like for a while in the early 2000s, every Asian comedian was doing their parents' accents. Nowadays it still is very much present, but we see a lot more Asian comedians not relying on it."
20,uicc0c,"I disagree with your last sentence.  The ones who are fans are laughing at the content.  I really like Nigel’s content and am seeing him live in October.  I don’t really think about the accent on his videos.  The fuiyo and haiya don’t really register to me anymore.  I just love how well he can improv, and how he can pull off so many clever jokes.  

I’m also a purist to an extent, and prefer authentic cuisine over the mcdonaldizayion of international food.  I really like his cooking videos, and would rather watch him review a YouTube video instead of watching the video on my own."
21,uicc0c,"I like Uncle Roger's accent. I think we need to normalize making it an accent just like any other for characters, not making it a negative thing. I don't think white people should be doing Asian accents because I don't trust that they will do it right, but what if doing a Singapore accent was just like doing a British accent and there were no poor connotations? Also there are lots of Youtubers that use/capitalize on their real accents. For example the cooking channel Asian At Home has a ""Nuders"" shirt because that's how she says noodles and she thinks it's funny. Another accent I love is Margaret Cho's impression of her mom's voice mails. It matters to me where the accent comes from. The bigger problem is no normalization of accents. More Asian actors should be allowed to have their authentic accent without being the butt of a joke. For now we mostly have ""authentic adjacent"" people using their relative's accents. But there are those I can think of that can be proud of their real accents. Ronny Chieng, Kumail Nanjiani, Aditi Mittal."
22,uicc0c,"I understand some comics think “using the accent is empowering/some Asians do have that accent, it’s nothing to be ashamed of” but if you can’t get a laugh or an audience without it, do something else. You’re not doing the accent for Asian Americans, you’re doing it for your wallet and your non-Asian audience. A thief feels empowered, guess what, they’re still doing something wrong and harming their victims and making people who look like them look bad. I’m not gonna say they should or shouldn’t do it. End of the day, you should look out for yourself first. But I disagree that it is empowering for anyone."
23,uicc0c,Nobody realize that Nigel basically copied Peter Chao back in the days
24,uicc0c,My 7 years old daughter told me that a white girl said she has Asian accent at gymnastics camp. I feel shocked and start to worry about the her future in her own home country. Damn it.
25,uicc0c,"Why? It’s just a joke… literally what is there to joke about in the 21st century moving forward? This is too woke, man."
26,uicc0c,"Accent jokes are done on all countries, Irish, Indian, french, Chinese, etc. If you are offended by them you're a pretty sensitive as a person. The great thing about comady shows is you don't have to go if your easily offended."

7,kiibtk,2020: the year filipino americans saved america.
0,j6omjr,"I think you have a unique opportunity to give your peers insight into a different kind of experience growing up in America. This club is exists to bring people together, and by taking on the mantle of leadership, you could attract other young people, not just Chinese Americans, to learn more about something so integral to your life. Food is always a draw. Try organizing a Chinese snack tasting or a cooking class! University life is about broadening one’s horizons, and being in the minority does not automatically mean you don’t belong."
1,j6omjr,"You're fine.  Don't worry too much. Keep doing what you're doing because you enjoy it, and not because of others' opinions.  There are folks like you.  Be patient, be understanding.  You don't have to fit into any neat little category.  You do you. Find people who appreciate your experience and knowledge.  不要怕慢慢來。"
2,j6omjr,"I don't know how useful is my advice, but college is a ""bigger"" world than high school, but the world after college is an immensely larger world. There is a place for all of us, and strong fluency in mandarin + Chinese culture is certainly a great thing. 

Don't spend too much time worrying about this. Just be yourself and you will find people who like you for you."
3,j6omjr,"There are a lot of great thoughts here already. I'll only add a couple things:

1. Your ""value"" to any group isn't necessarily based on how alike you are to everyone else. As some have pointed out, your different upbringing and perspective is something others can benefit from. You can take advantage of that.

2. I understand it's important to find people you relate to, though. Such a group can be a safe space for you. *However, don't limit yourself to exploring groups of people that look like you.* The best friends I've made in my life were those with whom I shared interests and had personalities compatible with mine. These friends are of diverse backgrounds - Indian, Iranian, Israeli, Chinese, Taiwanese, American, etc., and I find that I relate/belong to these friend groups more than anything else. In this vein, I suggest pursuing your interests and growing your friendships with people you meet along the way. It's a great way of exposing yourself to diverse opinions but also growing yourself as a person, too."
4,j6omjr,[removed]
5,j6omjr,"You belong to yourself. Don't get sucked into this group identity bullshit and let it define you. Your experiences can complement and enrich their experiences and their experiences can likewise complement and enrich your experiences. Don't see the club as a way to reinforce your group identity, think of it as a launching point from which you can develop new relationships."
6,j6omjr,"If you want to widen your social circle of Chinese people (rather than Chinese descent), there's also typically an association for Chinese students & scholars at most universities -- check online or around campus for flyers advertising social events in Chinese. Of course, depending on where you are they might not be doing much at the moment. There might be some initial awkwardness from the Chinese-ABC divide, but if you're fluent I don't think it should be a problem once you've gotten to know people on a personal level."
7,j6omjr,"I can relate to this as I had a similar upbringing to you as an ABC. One thing I had the privilege of learning when growing up around other Asian kids is the spectrum of an ABC (or any other second-gen Asian kid) is HUGE. Everything from as white washed as you can get to still being very in touch with their roots. Heck, I can even see it within my own family. My brother left home at 18 and got super integrated into American culture and white washed in my eyes compared to myself. 

The experiences of ABC alone vary so much, there's millions of us out there! When it comes to finding the people you connect with, you'll find it may not have to do so much with being Chinese. It may be an initial point of connection or the cherry on top, but in my experience, the long lasting friends I remain close with is due to many other reasons. There's some great advice in the thread - try out some different clubs and expand your circle. You'll find your niche!"
8,j6omjr,"Why do you have to be a perfect peg in one group?

Embrace your inner hipster and revel in your differences. They don't know the dragon festival story? Be happy you get to explain it. 

ABC's got a similar division with ppl who can speak Chinese and the twinkies that can't, no biggie."
9,j6omjr,"Like the other comments have said- you are a bit luckier in some ways because you were included more in the Chinese culture, taught more, etc. Now you can perhaps be a bit of that person that they needed to teach them the ""inside story"" about what it is to be Chinese and what certain traditions and foods are. Your group mates are lucky to have you!"
10,j6omjr,"Welcome to the club, friend. I'm an ABC but spent a few years in China for middle/high school so in college I could mingle pretty easily in the Chinese international student crowd. I made friends in both groups but never truly felt like I fit in with either, for the same reasons you described. In the end I just stopped trying and came to terms with the fact that a dual identity was something that will be a part of me for the rest of my life, and that that was not a bad thing. Same with you, you can hang out with both groups, but don't feel pressured to have to ""fit in"" with either group."
11,j6omjr,"As someone who is in the ""super ABC"" category I can tell you that you and your background are appreciated. I grew up in an area with very few Asians and even fewer Chinese people. Learning about Chinese culture and improving my Chinese skill always came hard, especially when my parents were trying to ""Americanize"" me so I would fit in. So now when I have friends who are super in touch with their Asian/Chinese side, I value their perspective and knowledge. 

Please, continue hanging around those people. It might be a bit weird not not fit cleanly into the designated categories especially in college, but don't worry we appreciate you."
12,j6omjr,"You might find you have more in common with them than you think. I find that in comparison to white ppl I feel very drawn and related to all Asians. Shift your frame of mind from just the club to your entire life. What do you and these Asians have in common that you and others don't? Focus on those similarities.

On the flip side, spend more time with people of other cultures. It will give you a wider range of experience to recontextualize your mental framework. The comparing mind is a tricky thing. I think we all too often as Asians have a negative and critical comparing mind. Exercise your positive comparing mind and look for similarities rather than differences. Even between seemingly unrelated things and people.

You're going through a lot it seems. I know how you feel. Finding community and feeling connected can be difficult work. But if you can open your heart enough. It can be worth it."
13,j6omjr,"Being Asian-American is a spectrum. If you only spend time with people entirely like you, you’ll get tunnel visioned. __Their experiences growing up as an ABC is just as valid as your experiences growing up as an ABC.__ America is a melting pot of different races, ethnicities, and backgrounds. Stop labeling people and start listening to people’s stories. 

Culturally it may be hard for you! American culture is very individualistic whereas Chinese culture is all about making people uniform (erasing personal identity). But there is a lot to learn through personal connection and there is a lot you can too provide. Don’t be that person living in a bubble until old age. Chinese people tend to feel comfortable in the bubble but it’s not sustainable and unrealistic at times. Get out of that comfort zone, while understanding that you are not better or more special than anyone else."
14,j6omjr,I had the opposite problem whereas I'm ABC and the Taiwan and Chinese clubs are mostly for FOB groups that spoke Mandarin. They kind of exclude you if you don't read or speak mandarin fluently.
15,j6omjr,"Hey, that's me! I was too Chinese for ABC groups, too American for CBC groups. Honestly, it's still hard to find where I belong between those spectrum ends, but it's OK. It used to bother me when I was younger but at this point I'm OK with that. I have a close knit Asian American group that spans a lot of east and south east Asia. We are all pretty much 1.5 generation immigrants, trying to figure out who we are and how we fit here.

We all like to draw, play video games and watch anime, and we all know what it's like to straddle two cultures, so it's been all kinds of fun bonding over every aspect of our lives.

You'll find your group, it might not be a Chinese specific group and that's OK too. I love a lot of things about my culture but over the last several years I've come to love learning about my friends' culture too."
16,j6omjr,"I feel like I’m inbetween as well. I’m not fluent but not helpless in Mandarin (2 gen removed from China), grew up being proud of our heritage and have a good grasp of much of the traditional culture. I can’t fully fit with the immigrant Chinese because I’m not that fluent and wasn’t raised in Asia. But I’m too Chinese in a lot of ways for many ABCs. I don’t know why but I feel a mix of disappointment, loneliness, and embarrassment when ABCs think I am too “___” compared to them. There’s a type that would sometimes estrange themselves from me in group settings. Like they won’t talk to me but will happily chat up anyone else in the room. Ultimately I relate pretty well to immigrant Chinese that have been here in the US for a while, like a decade or so. 

Sorry OP. I just have a little commiseration here. It’s not easy and it’s kinda lonely. But there are others like you and you’ll find each other eventually, so long as you stay social. It doesn’t sound like you’re clicking well with this group at your school, and that’s okay."
17,j6omjr,"There’s no group you can fit in 100% because everyone is a special individual.

If the core purpose of this club is to letting people complain about racism together, that’s probably what you should expect to gain by joining it. 

If you want friends, there are a lot of other options: go game, martial art, sports...

If you want to learn more you know about Chinese culture, you can take real classes from nearby schools."
18,j6omjr,"Thats the diaspora for you. Try to find things that aren't Chinese that you can connect on (food is an easy one usually) and then use that as a way to teach them more about your experience. The Chinese American community spans a century and a half at this point, so there is a lot of variation and a huge range of ways of being Asian American. 

You should try to start a book club or get involved in leadership. That way you can all get on the same page about things. My suggestions for the book club would be Asian American Dreams or Last Boat out of Shanghai. As far as films go you should watch Better Luck Tomorrow and Love Boat: Taiwan. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better\_Luck\_Tomorrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Luck_Tomorrow) [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10335096/](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10335096/) Even discussing episodes of Fresh Off the Boat, Nora From Queens, or WongFu would be a good way to open up the discussion. Remember as much as you don't understand the way they think, they don't understand you. So you have to find a way to listen to each other and respect and celebrate your differences."
19,j6omjr,"They want to know you. I’m an ABC but I lived in Taiwan for a year after college and it changed my life. Share with them your culture. They are likely dealing with an identity crisis. I know I was living one before I experienced Taiwan.

Edit: my college didn’t have a Chinese club, only Korean, Indo, etc."
20,j6omjr,"From my experience, ABC == American. I noticed this a lot too among other ethnicities cliques, which kind of make sense since they grew up in America but just happen to have Asian parents and roots. So I stop expecting to join say Chinese club in university or Korean club for there to be real native Chinese or Korean anymore. When I wanted to make friends with the real natives, I just sought out language exchanges in universities or through some kind of international student organisation"
21,j6omjr,"sounds like a good time educate your peers on those things. for example the question about zongzi is an opportunity to teach them.

also, find a club that you're having fun in. if the chinese club isn't working out, find another club of interest"
22,j6omjr,"Our college had like three Taiwanese clubs and the difference between them was basically how fobby you were. The website for the most fobby one was all in traditional Chinese and included instructions for how to get a visa at the top of the page.

So...safe to say there are people with the same level of Chinese-ness as you. Just gotta find them."
23,j6omjr,"I had the exact same problem in college. I joined both the ‘ABC’ club and the international Chinese students club. After 2 years I accepted that I don’t fit in any neat box and I never will. 

I’m too Chinese and too in touch with my culture for the ABCs, who deep down are still wrestling with a hate for their own skin color. They felt exactly like what they called themselves, bananas. I had no interest in bonding over anime, ABG culture, or just boba tea. I grew up with an understanding of the richness of my culture and I didn’t feel their insecurities on the same level.

Even worse I felt most of them were only friends because they were asian looking. That felt cheap. 

The international Chinese never felt like I was Chinese enough. I am fluent and can read maybe 500 characters, but that’s less than elementary school. I couldn’t keep up with the trendy slang, puns, and games. I also didn’t go through gao kao, the high stress country wide tests that determine your entire future. So I couldn’t really relate and was too American. 

You don’t seem to fit in either box and that can feel lonely. I’ve always wondered if there could be a different name for people in this category.

I disagree with the posts saying you should teach the ABCs. This is exhausting to be the ambassador for an entire body of culture thousands of years old. 

I did it and it wasn’t rewarding in the way you might think. 

These days a lot of my friends are Singaporean or international expats from Japan or Taiwan. They are bilingual or trilingual. The crux of the problem is about culture. 

What you need to look for are groups of friends who bring the richness of their own culture with them. Look for friends who are more like salads than a mixing pot. Individual cultures distinct but together with harmony.

For me there were two choices: 

1) Embrace ABC culture where my heritage is diluted and learned only through the lens of Westerners. Such as just watching Mulan, drinking boba, or listening to the occasional Chinese song
2) Travel through asia, research my own traditions, go to museums, pick up a hobby my culture commonly embraces,etc. 

What you do attracts the kind of people who are similarly into those things."
24,j6omjr,"Embrace your knowledge and the amount of exposure you've had to your culture. I felt the same way as you, and my other advantage was that I am fluent in Cantonese, meanwhile most people I knew had very limited Chinese-speaking abilities. Use your knowledge as an advantage to educate people—people will start going to you for advice. After all, it is a club where people want to immerse more into their heritage and you have the upper hand of being more exposed to your Chinese heritage."
25,j6omjr,"I'm not Malaysian, Indonesian, Taiwanese, Japanese, or Vietnamese, but when I was in college I joined those student organizations and participated fully. I learned a great deal, and I am still very close to many of the people I met then. Without going into my own experiences too much (best four years of my life), you can join them without being like them. As for the feeling like an outsider, you're still ABC - help the ones who want to learn more about their heritage to learn the things they never did. Be the odd one out! and jump in with both feet!"
26,j6omjr,"I think it’s important to recognize that Chinese American / Asian American experiences are not monolithic. Everyone varies in terms of language fluency and knowledge of customs, foods, and traditions. Some people grow up being the only Asian student at their school, while others like yourself grow up among many Asians.

My advice to you is to try to be open to making friends with people who may have different experiences than your own. Try to embrace those differences as well as find common ground. 

I have friends who speak Cantonese and friends who speak Mandarin; friends who are fluent but aren’t as familiar with customs/traditions, whereas I myself can’t speak the language but comparatively might have more knowledge of customs/traditions; friends who were born outside the US and friends who were born in the US. We’re all able to hang out together and learn from each other.

It’s also important to recognize that people from China aren’t monolithic either. You mentioned that people from China say they can’t relate to you because you’re an ABC, but not everyone is like that. Find the people that are open to connecting with you, and be sure to convey the same sort of openness in return."
27,j6omjr,"Find where you have the most fun.  As most said, you don't need to pigeon hole yourself into one group.  That said if you're looking for asian cultural group, find out where all the international students groups are hanging out.   Also check if there is a club around asian tv dramas, there seems to be plenty of those and I think that might fit what you're looking for."
28,j6omjr,"I have both intl and the farther removed ABC friends. I usually speak mando with my intl friends and Eng with my ABC friends, but it's nice to just be able to relate to more kinds of people in different ways. They're not a monolith either. I have intl friends who went to hs in the states and ABC friends that might have other similar interests to me (shows, gym, idk man), and it's great to be able to hang out with both. I think you'll find your people:)"
29,j6omjr,"This speaks volumes to me. I was born in Canada and my first language is English. I'm ethnically Korean. My family decided to move to Korea and I've been here for 7 years now.
It's not easy cuz I don't 100% fit in with Asian Americans -- I'm too ""Korean"" for that crowd becaude I'm somewhat more familiar about Korean culture and I'm pretty much fully fluent in it. A lot of Asian American friends aren't.
And don't get me started on Koreans who lived in Korea their whole (of majority of their) life. They think I'm ""not Korean enough"". Some think I can't speak a word of Korean no matter how many times I tell them I can. 

I think it's always going to be difficult because there aren't that many American-born Asians who are in touch with their Asian heritage. But I still think it's so valuable to be bicultural -- it just gives you an open mind about different cultures. And for me, I'm bilingual, which I've always liked."
30,j6omjr,"Take it from an ABC who has been accused by other ABCs of being a total Banana...they can be just as insecure about their identity as you are so don't hold it against them or yourself. I grew up with a lot of ABC friends but probably more Vietnamese and Filipino (and friends of all types, really) just because of the area. So when I had opportunities to connect with bigger ABC groups (or other AA groups), I found out that I never understood the need to force myself to fit into something just because of the circumstance of birth or where my parents came from.

I am an individual whose experiences are unique but has overlaps with other people. You can embrace being similar and unique at the same time, I know the world makes it seem like that is impossible but it's not. It's not like I'm a total blank slate when it comes to my own culture either, I immerse myself in educating myself on things especially culture, food, literature, film, music, history, regionalisms, language, art etc. at least I'd like to think. I seek out things I don't know about and that isn't limited to Asian stuff. I found a lot of ABCs tend to extrapolate their own experience as being what everyone experiences. I don't need to tell you, Chinese people are as diverse as anything, just by sheer numbers and places people are from, it's impossible that everyone is the same. Many ABCs (like I was growing up) are completely unfamiliar with the cultures of Chinese people outside of a couple of provinces. Not blaming them, that is THEIR experience. 

But are your group members open to hearing YOUR experiences? I'm not saying to give up on these clubs. I think they can be good! But don't think you have to blend in like a chameleon or something. Maybe encourage the group to be more about sharing experiences rather than echo-chambering them? If you get pushback, find other individuals or groups that want to connect in the same way you want to?"
31,j6omjr,maybe try to join a Chinese international student club instead?
32,j6omjr,"I was in the same boat. At my school they had two diff groups, one for ABK's and one for international Koreans. I joined both and promptly dropped out, but I met literally one person from each group, and we formed a larger friend group that consisted of so and so's roommate, so and so's church buddy, so and so's acquaintance from orientation, so and so's acquaintance from hardcore Korean international student drink nights, etc. 

Hang in there and forge your own friend groups. Even though it's an effort, I can't be happier with the communities I've formed. It's probably better because you actually have some say in the community's culture/values as opposed to having to blend into one that already exists!"

It would be a far different story if someone used a title that liberal Democrats overwhelmingly reject closing educational opportunities to PRC applicants, despite geopolitical tensions.

7,qqyjjd,"This is an instance of the inevitable conclusion of efforts to downplay, minimize, and/or erase the POC status of Asians, such as the pushing of the replacement of ""POC"" with ""BIPOC"" (in its most common definition as ""Black, Indigenous, and \[other\] People of Color"" rather than its significantly less common definition as ""Black and Indigenous People of Color"", which doesn't have the same issue of relegating Asians to ""other"" status among POC)."
8,qqyjjd,"It really sounds no more different than the violent parents at baseball and football games, who then get their kids into fight on the field.

The only difference here is that it's a minority against another minority. 

Maybe people should stop taking GAMES so seriously as to assault others. Grow up."
9,qqyjjd,"This is just awful. I don't know why the police haven't done anything so far. And the mother should honestly be separated from the kid completely because she's very clearly a bad influence. 

Not only do I feel bad for the child injured and her family but honestly I feel like the more stuff like this happens and is publicized, the more racial division will happen in the US and abroad. I've already seen plenty of very disparaging remarks about other people of color (particularly black people) and vise versa in the replies to this video in other subreddits and I feel like the issue of racism will probably never go away. 

Part of me feels very guilty about typing this as a black man saying all of this stuff about possible racism against black people in reply to a horrific crime against an Asian girl, but honestly, it's been on the back of my head for a while and I feel like poc/poc racism is very much overlooked. This is especially the case in the black community and racism towards Asian people among us. I truly want to and have been learning more about other groups of people in the US and their struggles against bigotry and racism.

I'm sorry if this sounds very disjointed and weird because it's basically all of my thoughts being thrown out. I am very privileged to have faced minimal amounts of racism throughout my life but when I hear about others suffering such attacks I honestly just feel awful for them."

>The woman’s daughter attempted to defuse the situation, and apologized to Sue for the outburst. But the woman continued taunting Sue. Finally an employee removed the woman from the line after Sue asked for the store to deal with the situation.

Good on the daughter for standing up for Sue."

0,8x7mt0,Good for the Asian guy.
1,8x7mt0,"Jealous white dude couldn't handle the fact that someone had a car that he couldn't afford so he lashes out and kicks it... Then some other dude decides he's going to ""break up the fight"" by full-clip sprinting towards the Asian guy and fucking jumping on him like a flying squirrel. Then he has the nerve to go ""Dude I'm just trying to save you, I swear!""

Can't tell who I'm more angry at, the jealous loser who kicked the car, the pussy who decided to just jump tackle the Asian guy without any context or all the people who didn't let a justified beating take place. Im most cases violence is never the answer, but in some cases it is. This is one. You let the guy get his ass kicked for kicking a stranger's car out of pure hate and jealousy and then everyone moves on. Actually now I know who I'm the most angry at. That little bitch in the blue button up who decided it was his responsibility to jump-tackle the dude giving a justified beating. If you're going to break up a fight do what the dude in the blue t-shirt did and try to actually break them up by pulling one guy from behind or getting in between and separating them. You don't just pick a side and full on flying squirrel some dude.... if the Asian guy banged his head on the concrete after getting tackled like that it would have been SERIOUS damage. He needs to press charges against both of them but IMO moreso against the dude who just fucking sprint tackles him with complete reckless disregard. Easily could have killed him if his head hit the ground hard. Also is Mr. White Knight going to ignore the fact that the dude in the black tanktop decided to throw his first punch while the Asian dude is on the ground faced away, trying to get up? Total bitch move. If that punch would have landed it could have done serious damage. Asian guy was on the ground, faced away and stumbling to his feet moving in the direction of that punch. If it connected it would have been lights out.

And to those saying this wasn't about race... this was definitely about race. He wouldn't have kicked the car if it was a white guy driving it. The blue button up guy would not have jump tackled a white guy fighting. You can tell he's a little bitch by the way he tries to cover his ass at the end by going ""I was just trying to stop you bro I promise"" right after he realizes his original plan to jump the Asian dude wasn't going to work.

Edit: Also turns out the Asian woman yelling ""STOOOOP"" is the white dude's wife. He was walking with her and his kid and decides to kick some Asian dude's car for ""being too loud"" right in front of his infant son. Amazing parent and a true role model. But sure, let's deny that any sort of Asian male hatred was the source of that kicking. "
2,8x7mt0,"I like how that one guy was telling the brother about not throwing punches and holding him back only after it’s evident that he could kick their asses one on one. I bet if he didn’t fight back they would have tried more shit.  We need more of this, don’t take any shit from these racist ass mothers.  Just like that Asian-American guy on BART who was being slapped by some racist.  No one did jack, just filmed it, but when the Asian-American dude got up to defend himself and was about to fight back, people finally got up to hold the Asian-American guy back saying,”you’re bigger than this.”  It’s like people want to see the Asian guy go down to mock him."
3,8x7mt0,How any in way would tackling someone de-escalate the situation?  Fuck the blue-shirt guy for not trying to just put himself in the middle between the 2. Could've severely injured the Asian man if he hit the floor too hard or wrongly.
4,8x7mt0,"Other dude who was trying to tackle was being too self-righteous for his own good. Seriously, there are better ways to break up the fight than just lunging at a person."
5,8x7mt0,"Two against one, but dang is he fit and did he hold himself pretty well considering the other dude just blindsided him. I myself am decently strong ever since I started working out in college. But I'm not toned or anything like that, and I haven't taken any fighting classes, so I doubt I'd hold up as well in these kind of situations. Well I guess if I have time I might as well get started. Especially since we've been seeing more of these incidents in the Bay recently, which I always thought was a chill place. "

0,tcomj8,"I didn’t have to be a girl to connect with Mei’s discovery of her attraction to the opposite gender.  Nor did I have to be a girl to understand the embarrassment of going through puberty.  I wasn’t thinking about being Chinese when I cried at Mei and Ming voicing their struggles with hurting their parents.  

I’m a bit out of the loop and it seems it was one review that is getting all this flack, but all the same it’s annoying that somehow (a) white critic(s) can’t connect with what are perfectly normal parts of growing up just because it happens to be female or a minority."
1,tcomj8,"Funny how no one said anything of that nature re: Encanto, Disney's Latin American musical. So that couch critic found that movie more relatable than Turning Red? Please.

To me, the implication is clear. He, subconsciously or not, still sees Asian-Americans/Canadians as ""Other"". So, he felt emboldened to write a review that had the effect of dismissing efforts to give greater representation to a group that makes up an important part of the social fabric of these countries. These kind of people think they can dissect Asian-Am/Can experiences without backlash, but will keep their mouths shut when it comes to media featuring black or latino/a leads and casts because doing the latter is politically correct."
2,tcomj8,">For many in the Asian community, O'Connell's review felt all too familiar, and still deeply frustrating.
>
>Nancy Wang Yuen, a sociology professor at Biola University and author of ""Reel Inequality: Hollywood Actors and Racism,"" said the review didn't match up with her perception of the film at all.
>
>""She's just this average 13-year-old girl who has this puberty issue, so I think it's funny right? Because it's actually probably the more relatable representation of Asians, the most humanized version,"" Wang Yuen said.
>
>For O'Connell to say that the film was made for a narrow group of people, it's ""the centering of whiteness,"" Wang Yuen said.
>
>""If it's not white, it's somehow marginal,"" she said, ""The global majority is Asian, so there are a lot of people who can relate to this.""
>
>She also points out that most animated movies are ""strange"" in some way, and that a film doesn't have to reflect her personally, as a straight, Asian woman, in order for her to connect.
>
>""It's not like I could relate to Ratatouille... I didn't even know Ratatouille was a dish,"" she said. ""It's not like we're not exposed to things that don't speak to us personally.""
>
>""It's uncomfortable for people who are used to a white male-centric perspective, not understanding that there are other ways of storytelling... There's emotions in 'Turning Red' that are absolutely part of a human story,"" she said."
3,tcomj8,"If there were any questions about whether some folks still view Asians as 'perpetual foreigners', this is an answer."
4,tcomj8,One critic called it a very sexual film... There's nothing sexual. Asians have also been accused of drinking sharkfin and birdnest soup for sexual powers. Isn't that odd.
5,tcomj8,"Hey remember how when Finding Nemo came out and everyone could relate to being a dad who lost their only child? Or, you know, being a fish? 

Or when Cars came out and no one struggled with identifying as a race car finding their competitive nature?

Oh yeah how about that classic, and average experience of being a French chef in Paris and finding a magical mice who can pull on your hair to cook micheline star meals? 

You know, just stuff us average joes all go through?"
6,tcomj8,"It's unrelatable because a lot of Americans think everything that exists, they are the center of the universe. Racism and socioeconomic dynamics that is portrayed in say China or like India doesn't matter to these people because the only racism is white and black.

And as a result you have stupid people thinking racism is purely about power and white supremacy and say stuff like you can't be racist to white or white adjacent aka asians rather than expanding the scope and including the different types of racism and racist issues differing cultures and nations face.

And it also doesn't help actual white supremacists use this reasoning if racism existing outside USA as an excuse to justify their own prejudice."
7,tcomj8,I had to watch the movie in two sittings because Mei’s mother’s lack of emotional intelligence was so relatable it started to remind me of my own mom and piss me off. I enjoyed it though
8,tcomj8,Could it also be because it's tailored around the experiences of a Chinese Canadian girl from Toronto instead of the Southern California (and to a lesser extent NYC) as-a-default experience that pervades Hollywood storywriting?
9,tcomj8,"Aside from the problems that other commenters have addressed, the review also makes it seem like Toronto is the only place in North America or even the so-called ""West"" with large Asian populations. As someone from the Bay Area, this feels so ""othering"". I haven't yet watched the movie but from what I've seen from reviews/Wikipedia/etc., it already feels very relatable to me, from the diversity of Asians presented (Chinese, Indian, Korean \[which is incidentally literally my close friend group\]) and the normalization and humanization thereof. Here people like us are the majority so this reviewer in one fell swoop completely invalidated my life, relationships, and experiences, as well as those of my friends and family. I'm really happy to see a *major*\-major film company make a film that validates Asian Americans/Canadians/etc. who live in places like Toronto, or Cupertino, or Ontario, where there's not only many of us, but also many different types of people like us. Usually in movies there's the Asian character who either conforms to the stereotype or blatantly rejects it (which basically means that the character is still built around the framework of the stereotype), or often, these days, the binary where two Asian characters just serve as opposites. We're starting to finally see normalization, humanization, and nuance especially (*Always Be My Maybe*; *Never Have I Ever*; *Kim's Convenience* \[ehh, kinda\]) where Asian-ness is portrayed in its fluid, ever-changing malleability, and where Asian Americans are actually beginning to be portrayed as Asian *Americans*, not as Asians in America; but of *course* as soon as we make some progress white people want to immediately take it away."
10,tcomj8,Honestly calling this movie unrelatable is like saying Cars wasn't relatable because only talking vehicles can understand it kek
11,tcomj8,"No spoilers, but the 3rd act has a beautiful combination of Mei’s Chinese and Canadian culture both being necessary to finish a task together.  I wanted to cry"
12,tcomj8,Because no one else turns into pandas?
13,tcomj8,My 9 year old white American girl loved this movie. She related to it on all levels.
14,tcomj8,interesting that my black friend from another country found it very relatable.. it’s a personal choice someone’s making to not relate to something. i don’t particularly like the artistry of this cartoon. They make the child look kinda ugly imo but i’ll try to watch it.
15,tcomj8,"Because her name is Meilin. A Hollywood chinese name, not really a Chinese name. I don’t know anyone named Meilin."

Second Degree murder and 1st degree murder in the end is still murder. It's just the sentencing structure which is different.

At that time the number was closer to 30%."

1,aorag3,"I think this issue is a little more complex than is represented here, and really difficult to navigate because the government of China does of course have some quite serious human rights issues, but at the same time reddit is quite irrational and biased against China.

I will just say that I find the usage of Tiananmen on reddit highly distasteful. It seems to me very disrespectful to the people who died to use their deaths to score points against a corporation which is minority stakeholder of a social media website, especially when reddit so often exhibits contempt for Chinese people. If redditors truly care about the freedom and rights of Chinese people, then they should become journalists, lawyers, or activists for human rights in China, instead of engaging in lazy, hate-driven slacktivism that is more likely to harden Chinese opinion against values such as human rights as it is to help."
2,aorag3,"Disclaimer: I am not a supporter of the Chinese government (I’m actually not a huge fan of any major power government).

Something really stood out to me when I saw pictures of the Tiananmen massacre posted on /r/pics and then later someone else posted pictures of the My Lai massacre (by someone presumably trying to point out that the US has also committed horrific atrocities in the past). 

I have a really big fucking problem with the white Reddit response I saw in that post. Top voted comments were pointing out that at least in US the My Lai massacre is not censored (which isn’t entirely the truth but that’s another rant). My fucking problem with these people is *you don’t get to pat yourself on the back for being marginally better when it comes to the killing of innocent men women and fucking children*.

Yes, I’m glad that we can share pictures of US atrocities on the internet. You know what would be even better? TO NO LONGER COMMIT FUCKING ATROCITIES. All this circlejerking about how the west is better than China based on freedom of the press, while technically true, is a textbook example of missing the forest for the trees.

In the 40 years since My Lai has US aggression been curbed in any way? When we invaded Iraq (and funny enough I’m old enough to remember the absolutely massive propaganda effort before the invasion) and caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocents how much solace should I really find in the fact that I’m free to talk about how bad the war makes me feel?

Edit: some words and spelling.

Edit #2: [oh good they’ve turned the massacre of my people into a giant joke. These privileged little pricks don’t give a shit about chinese lives and their hypocrisy is apparently endless.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/aovpnq/lego_version/?st=JRYKI0AO&sh=55ccad31)"
3,aorag3,"Reeducation. 

On reddit the response against China is overwhelming, they seem to be blind to the fact tht many western countires have done similar atrocities and yet no one is reciting, REMEMBER, RUSSIA/UK/AMERICA/GERMANY/AFRICA/INSERTAFRICANCOUNTRY DID THIS. 

I feel like our fears of how asians are being marginalised in rl are being reflected in the way only a minority of people are making the distinction between the Chinese Government and China the place/people.

Also, i think people are using this opportunity as aan easy karma farm.

Fuck those guys..."
4,aorag3,"Its just stressful. There was racism before of course, but now with Trump in power and the policies he's pursued I feel like Chinese Americans and by extension Asians, every week have been playing a game of musical chairs with Hispanics and Arab Muslims for who is America's most hated minority. The shitty thing is that the Chinese restaurant attack in New York was not even a Trump inspired hate crime. I'm still waiting for the Trump inspired hate crime and considering that Chinese New Year parades will be happening soon, I'm just biting my nails thinking that an alt-righter will commit a terrorist attack around that time. The thing that makes me lose hope is that while Arab Muslims have the protection of the Democrats, Asians do not have that luxury and are thoroughly seen as outsiders by both ends of the political spectrum. It may be shitty, but best thing to hope for is Trump starts a war in Venezuela or Iran, buy Asians probably at least 8 years. "
5,aorag3,"I wouldn’t be too concerned about stuff happening in real life; this current bout of sinophobia is purely a reddit thing ‘cause of the recent 5% investment from tencent. They’ll soon lose interest and move onto the next karma-whoring topic. 

Although, I’ll agree that it’s pretty concerning that people are so easily swayed into absolutely hating something like that. /r/pics is filled to the brim with anti-China posts right now, many of which are at least misleading, if not outright false. "
6,aorag3,"The first thing people should stop thinking is: all Chinese have affinity with *mainland* China. Chinese people are more complex than that. There are many ethnic Chinese in Southeast Asia that have loyalties/affinity in Southeast Asian countries, and there are Taiwanese and HK citizens who are not thrilled to be lumped with the mainland Chinese."

10,aorag3,"I’m a bit out of the loop, can you guys tell me what recent threads have been showing this racism? Is it the Huawei stuff?"
11,aorag3,"To be fair, most of the anti-Chinese sentiment in Asia seems to be regular xenophobia, the kind that is rooted in history more than cuurent politics. In the West, yeah, anti-PRC sentiment will make this get ugly."
12,aorag3,"They are psychopaths and they are in racial war against us, there is no way to escape this. Whenever we try to defend ourselves they will accuse us of being attacking them, only castrated and brainwashed people dont understand that they never had and will never have any form of honestity or coherence.

The only realistic way to win this war is to play the same game and attack them 10x more than they attack us, all other approaches are as effective as pigeons of peace."
13,aorag3,"I’m thinking the average person can logically understand that there is distinction between extremists in China and an average Chinese American and Chinese citizen, the same way we can logically understand there is a distinction between extremists in the west and the average western citizen (or maybe I spoke too soon because some of you seem to not be able to tell the difference between the latter). 

So I personally don’t really think, “Oh this is dangerous for us Asians.”  Maybe I’m naive but this is just everyday life in knowing shit government and shit people are a cancer in a lot of countries. "

18,aorag3,"Eh.. I could not be less concerned. Unless you live in bumble-fuck-town USA, people generally understand the nuance between the Chinese government and Chinese-Americans. Yes, there are some of us who are brainwashed CCP-loyalists, but everyone else is just trying to carry on with their lives.

Long story short, don't let some keyboard warriors and/or trolls intimidate you. They are powerless until you give them your attention."
19,aorag3,"Do you guys know how awful tencent is? Have you used their products?

I have talked about Falungong and Tiananmen square massacre when I and my friend were both in US, on their instant messenger (QQ). And later I found out some of my massages just disappeared, my friend never received them. They were censoring my private messages for fucks sake. And god knows who they reported these messages to.

They've also been purging accounts from WeChat just recently. Feminists, LGBTQ rights activists, environmentalists or people who merely live abroad, their accounts were shut down or stripped privileges.

Yes there is racism among people on Reddit. But I'd still be very concerned companies like Tencent gaining influence in US companies without any ressistance."

7,7wydni,I missed her performance (but recorded it) but saw the interview with one of her teammates talk to about how they were both sad that they missed out on being included on the last Olympic team so I'm so happy for them now.

0,pvxb6r,"Yeah, this happens. And it is also in part that we don't get included in the statistics. I remembered I approached a professor about the demographic breakdown in CS, where it only included Whites, African American and Hispanics; then went into the specifics of Asian American and how there is a great divide in educational access (i.e. Chinese vs Hmong). She just rolled her eyes at me and didn't even reply.

And when I worked in Diversity things in college, it gets the same reaction because there is the idea of the rich Asian immigrant, but there isn't the recognition that in the populace, there are people who are refugees or sponsored, etc."
1,pvxb6r,"Basically, Southeast Asians.

There's an overrepresentation by East Asians when it comes to Asian.

I mean, just look at how many East Asians are in Raya, compared to Southeast Asians and Raya was supposed to be a ""Southeast Asian"" representation.

Even ""Crazy Rich Asians"" is East Asian (though technically, the novel is a representation of Southeast Asian Chinese)"
2,pvxb6r,"This is a convenient time to remind y'all that ""Asian-American"" is a *political* movement united primarily by a shared struggle in the United States, including as subjects of racism, imperialism, systemic discrimination, etc. So it is meaningless if it doesn't place special focus on the concerns and interests of historically disadvantaged groups, in particular communities disproportionately affected by the effects of American imperialism and systemic racism, e.g. those from south/southeast asia, the pacific islands, indigenous groups (e.g. Hmong, Okinawan, etc.). 

A solidarity movement that doesn't practice solidarity with the unique issues facing its particularly constituent groups is fundamentally worthless"
3,pvxb6r,"This was actually a very dope read. Thanks for sharing this here. As a Hmong-American pursuing a Bio degree, I related to many of the sentiments in this article. Even though a lot of Asian-Americans face many of the same obstacles and struggles, the entire experience is definitely not uniform for everyone.

I definitely saw that growing up around other Hmong, Thai, Lao, and Karen people. It was very very different from how Western media portrays the nerdy geeky Asian lmao."

6,pvxb6r,"Hah, Fil-Am (no Chinese in me) that tried to force myself into STEM to appease my family. Couldn’t do it at all. I like calculus I suppose. Had zero desire to do it and sometimes I’ll be like, damn this starving artist style kind sucks. Unfortunately, I don’t get data structures, and I don’t like random bodily fluids."
7,pvxb6r,">”The analysis debunks the widespread perspective that Asian American students have uniformly high academic performance,” says Kang. “Further discussion is needed on the trajectories in the STEM job market for Filipino, Vietnamese and Thai students. Opportunities for relatively lower-paying STEM careers and access to two-year colleges are predominantly offered to particular subgroups by virtue of high school math and science course availability. This is in sharp contrast to the more demanding and advanced-level opportunities offered to other populations.”

>**Having parents with a graduate degree raised the odds of students selecting STEM majors as well, according to the study**. More than 70% of the parents of Chinese, Indian and Sri Lankan students attained a graduate degree, which was double the percentage of Vietnamese and Thai parents who received graduate education, says Kang.

I personally always felt like Vietnamese (and to a slightly lesser extent Filipinos) have a leg up compared to other SE Asian Americans when it comes to STEM representation. Definitely noticed that Vietnamese Americans have relatively high upward educational mobility from 1st to 1.5/2nd gen"
8,pvxb6r,[deleted]
9,pvxb6r,Is nursing considered a STEM major? I know a lot of Filipinos work in nursing. And it’s interesting that Filipinos don’t fare as well as Chinese students in STEM when Filipino households have a higher median income than Chinese households.
10,pvxb6r,"One thing to consider is that a lot of the immigrants from India and China are already in the STEM field prior to emigrating. You would expect that would make their kids to more likely choose STEM degrees. And in my experience, immigrants from Vietnam, including some of my family are generally starting off outside of STEM."

0,kse7n7,"Venting.

I'm tired of ""individualizing"" White people. Why do White people get to differentiate and not us? Why are we-- people of color-- forced to always turn the other cheek when Whites never have to come to any sort of accountability? Don't we have to question ""White culture"" as the problem in the same way many Whites see ""Rap culture"" or ""Black culture"" as the problem? Isn't there a better case to say that White people ACTUALLY are dangerous?

I'll say it: White America, YOU are why this country sucks. You have the power to make the rules whatever you wanted to and THIS is what you've chosen.  YOU chose McConnell, Trump, and Bush.

As an 1.5 gen Asian Am, I feel like I've always had a philosophy that White people were always going to get the better deal in the US. It was implicitly accepted. I don't know if that's the right way to operate but, even now, I'm like, ""OK White people, we're willing to split the pie 60/40 in your favor as long as you do policies that help everyone (e.g. healthcare, free college, etc.)."" No matter what, I reason, it's always going to be (at least) *slightly* better for them in this country. Yet, that doesn't seem like it's enough. IMO, Whites want/need to DOMINATE. It's not enough for them to have major advantages, they need to have major advantages and NEVER have to earn any of it. 

FUCK OFF! I'M DONE!"
1,kse7n7,Ted Lieu always been a real one for sure
2,kse7n7,"Nothing to do with race but with political bipartisan silly games.

People with BLM and such were openly burning and looting mere months ago, yet it took forever to label them as terrorists. Governors fiddled as cities they were charged with safeguarding burned. Now pro-Trumpers do it and it's instant. Some consistency would be nice; arrest everyone from both sides who does crap like this and prosecute them all for the same destructive behavior supporters of both sides engaged in. And, hopefully, we all realize that police are actually important. Calls to defund them months ago and now this happens and the very same people making those calls yell for more officers. Hypocrisy.

I'm no Trump fan, either, but what exactly is this call going to do? There's evidence the storming was openly planned online before Trump even made his speech. If they would've done it regardless, it wasn't incitement.

Here’s what he said: ""And after this, we're going to walk down there, and I'll be there with you, we're going to walk down ... to the Capitol and we are going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women…and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them. Because you'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong.""

Incitement or sedition beyond reasonable doubt? Hah. No. 2/3rd majority vote even with this stunt? No, politicians are still too caught up in bipartisan bull. Despicable and stupid words disgracing the office of president? Yes. 

Also, he's gone by this month, so why spend more taxpayer dollars on this uncertain garbage when he's just going to leave. Makes no sense. I like Ted, but I don't agree with him on this one."

0,upyf3f,That behavior is racist. You are not being sensitive.
1,upyf3f,"She knows you’re Asian, like duh.  Regardless of your boyfriend’s race, her saying “ew, Asian,” to your boyfriend is a clear and direct power play over you (or over you and your bf if he is Asian). 

Regardless, she’s a racist bitch.  Unfortunately, there are things your boyfriend cannot help you with and will not help you with.  He may not be as “woke” as you are.  This is probably part of his charm, maybe one of the reasons you’re attracted to him is because he’s not as perceptive as you.  Perhaps he has other redeeming qualities.  I get it.  Anyway.  She’s obviously racist.

I don’t know how willing you are to be petty, but this girl should not be in your boyfriend’s life. 

It’s up to him to make that happen, but as an older gay man who has had to stand up for myself and also be petty to remove these kinds of people from my relationships, I can say 
it’s also up to you to do it.

Edit: also, somebody pointed out your bf may be trying to gaslight you.  Yes, he is complicit.  Perhaps he is trying to exert control over you by proxy.  Who knows.  Maybe he’s an idiot."
2,upyf3f,She's racist and your BF is complicit. Guessing he's a white dude
3,upyf3f,"She's racist and your bf is being dismissive of your sentiments. It's pretty disgusting, tbh. Being dismissive of small matters like dirty socks in the middle of the room is one thing. But in regards to racism... He's trivializing your observations

You are your own person, so I won't tell you how you should date. But with a big matter like racism, I expect my partner to be on the same team as me

Edit: changed gaslighting to trivializing"
4,upyf3f,You should dump your bf for trying to gaslight you. Disgusting.
5,upyf3f,"In your face racism and your BF is like, ""no biggie, stop being a snowflake"". 

That your BF may be okay with racism directed against other Asian people and not you, but honestly the mentality that the friend has begs the question whether she thinks the same of you."
6,upyf3f,"It's not a big deal to him because he's not Asian. Definitely racist behavior. Just switch out Asian for white or black or any other ethnicity. 

Plus, you were disrespected to your face and he thinks that's alright? Heck no. Sorry you have to be around scums."
7,upyf3f,"For some context, is your boyfriend Asian or white?"
8,upyf3f,">My BF just says I'm too sensitive.  

You have other problems on your plate. His friend is the least of them."
9,upyf3f,Ya BF sucks.
10,upyf3f,"Uh, are you Asian, and BF is white? Whatever. 

This, ""you're too sensitive"" bs simply minimizes the daily trauma of not being white in a eurocentric world. 

Having a preference, isn't inherently racist. We're all shaped by culture and implicit biases.

You're BF is a dick for not acknowledging your feelings, and the Ukraine is racist. Their attitudes simply enable racist behavior, like the shooting in Buffalo, by a white supremacist."
11,upyf3f,Nah fuck that. Don’t let them make you think differently or feel differently about it. Racist is a racist. We don’t let that shit fly out apologize.
12,upyf3f,"No you’re not sensitive at all and your BF’s reaction is a red flag. 

Next time you see this behaviour, question her racism. “What’s wrong with a city that welcomes Chinese immigrants? What makes an Asian guy gross?” Ask your bf why he thinks you’re being sensitive for calling out on her behaviour too."
13,upyf3f,Skate on your man and this racist
14,upyf3f,LOL she's racist and your boyfriend is problematic. For your sake I hope you move on from both people down the line. Good luck
15,upyf3f,"That’s some next-level self hate if an Asian dude doesn’t care that his own friend is discriminating against him, jfc"
16,upyf3f,"How is this even a question??? Yes - this is racism - you call them out on it or dump this person from your life. If your BF is in agreement and continues to be in agreement then thats a tell tale sign of what to expect going forward (and an indication of what you will tolerate - which gets worse from here on out).

Every person I've known who's had this ""ew he's Asian"" attitude tends to look down upon Asians as second class citizens and will stab you in the back, gossip, control or leave you high and dry. In other words, they don't care about you and think that they are superior to you in every which way. This is a clear tell that this person looks down on you and somehow thinks that that is fine. This person will most likely not change so its none of your business to care about her going forward.

I have some Slavic friends (Ukrainian, Russian, Belarus, Hungarian, Polish, etc.) growing up in NYC who are cool with asians - they would never date an Asian dude like me but they are fine with being around asians and treating them with respect which I'm 100% okay with. I do know some Europeans, however, who are just downright racist (and completely oblivious to the fact that they are) and you've definitely come across one for sure with this person. Avoid.

Tell your BF to stop being friends with this person. If he disagrees then you know exactly what to do next..."
17,upyf3f,"Shes a definitely racist and your bf calling you too sensitive is a major red flag. Anyone that dismisses your feelings is not a good candidate for a partner, imho."
18,upyf3f,"No, she's racist against Asians."
19,upyf3f,tell she can go FOUK herself yeah you can like who like ...by when you this place too many asians then someone needs a foot planted in their \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  you decide
20,upyf3f,"No you aren't! There is a ton of racism against Asians and Chinese people from...basically everywhere including eastern Europe. Doesn't make it ok, cool, or acceptable."
21,upyf3f,"Your bf definitely gaslighted you, that it self is a red flag."
22,upyf3f,"There’s a difference between saying “No, he’s not my type” and “eww, no he’s Asian!” I’m not going to harp on taste, but that delivery is ignorant at best and racist at worst. As for that first statement about Vancouver, well there’s no getting around the intent."
23,upyf3f,"literally dictionary definition of racism.

you fail to mention your bf's race. if he is asian, then this girl is also basically telling him he's not good enough for her.

if your bf is white, then this is just a white person accepting/excusing racism in another white person. that behavior is disgusting and  should dump him."
24,upyf3f,"You're not overly sensitive, eastern Europe is racist against Asians I was told"
25,upyf3f,"She is racist. You’re not being sensitive and your BF is an asshole and complicit to the racist behavior of his friend. 

I would tell your boyfriend that I would never want to see that girl ever again. Or dump him if he calls you sensitive one more time."
26,upyf3f,"The dating this is her personal choice, but the mocking of those guys in front of you and your bf and saying eww, and saying Vancouver is shit cause it has too many Chinese.. those are racist and obnoxious

Don’t even question yourself and your feelings, they’re always trying to minimize our anger."

28,upyf3f,"You deserve to be with/around people who won’t mock your identity. Don’t hang out with people who are okay with casual racism, I hope those 2 jerks grow up someday."
29,upyf3f,"Definitely Racism, and tbh she just sounds like an awful human being."
30,upyf3f,The fact that you even have to ask is a huge yikes. Please develop some self-respect...
31,upyf3f,"Girl, please just get away and not deal with this. It’s too much bs. It’s not love. If who you thought  was your love can’t stand people as they are then move on."
32,upyf3f,"Not overly sensitive, that’s messed up.

I think people are used to being racist against Asians and feel like it’s okay to say things about us that they wouldn’t dare say about other POC"
33,upyf3f,No you are not being overly sensitive and your feelings are completely justified. She’s a racist simple as that. Where her feelings about Asians comes from we may never know.
34,upyf3f,"Yeah.. it's racist, but for some reason that fact that she's eastern European might make it at least less of a character flaw on her part (although if she is going to live here longer that had better change), and more a reflection of her own country's insecurities that she grew up with. Also,  as an Asian guy, I'd almost say this friend is just saying out loud the part that many people here don't say but think...I mean you can usually see it in their face.

anyway, I feel like a lot of my closest eastern European friends at some point casually say things they thought were obvious that are not only not true but kind of odd to believe--  i have also found that when corrected, many are usually receptive about acting more sensitive. 
Some comments that have taken me aback are things like  ""Asia doesn't have culture, Europe is the center of all culture"", or some cringey comment about Jewish people or Gypsies... Or this seems strongest in people from countries that have more of a complex about national identity or their importance (ie eastern Europe, the Balkans, Greece etc).

Maybe I'm giving her too much credit and she really is just racist in which case forget her, but having had many friends from Bulgaria, Ukraine, Russia and the various SSRs this seems more often the case than not."
35,upyf3f,Nope. She's racist and he's not sticking up for you. Time for a conversation.
36,upyf3f,"Yuppppp. For some reason, open micro-aggressions towards Asians seem to be ok (this however is very much a macro-aggression). Sorry you have to go threw that:("
37,upyf3f,Absolutely racist and I am annoyed AF that your bf (boyfriend or best friend) can't see it. I assume the bf is white which would explain the cluelessness to this.
38,upyf3f,"Your BF is probably a little racist, too. For him to dismiss your concern is no bueno. TBH...I feel everyone is a little racist."
39,upyf3f,Your partner should care about what upsets you. I think it's best let him know what's wrong and why he shouldn't ignore it. It's a big red flag and long term engagement with this type of neglect will not be healthy for your psyche.
40,upyf3f,"Uhh no that’s the definition of racism. 

Generally if you can imagine a black person getting angry about a similar comment, that’s usually racism. Black people are used to standing up for themselves over the years."
41,upyf3f,Is your bf AsIan?
42,upyf3f,[removed]
43,upyf3f,[deleted]
44,upyf3f,"I think the answer is quite clear from the comments here, but I also really don’t blame you for asking - the fact that *all of us here* have gone over this question in our heads speaks to the gaslighting and intentional racial doubt cast over the Asian American diaspora."
45,upyf3f,Dump him.
46,upyf3f,"It’s fairly normal for Russians and Ukrainians to think like this in their home country. But once they travel outside and live in western countries, you expect them to gain an appreciation for other cultures. This Ukrainian girl has not done that. She seems racist and close-minded. Your BF should be defending you and your culture, but tbh it seems like he doesn’t have an appreciation for your culture either. So basically, this situation kind of makes him look bad."
47,upyf3f,"You're not being too sensitive, and that behavior does seem to be racist, but she probably just doesn't know many actual Asian people. I don't think confronting her about it will necessarily fix anything."
48,upyf3f,"The bumble thing is fine imo, people are allowed sexual preferences and taste. The criticism on the city is racist fucked up though."
0,qah1jv,Niece had learned it from somewhere unfortunately.
1,qah1jv,"How old is the niece?

Edit: My spouse suggests ""Based on your SILs response, I think there are other issues in that family besides the one-time actions of a small child."""
2,qah1jv,"I think it would have made sense to explain to the kid what she was doing wrong BUT also, that mom sucks - making it about her and centering herself and her feels in this. She should be appalled by what her daughter is doing and instead of making it about her, ask you or figure out what she can do to help her daughter be better. Instead, she's just doing what white women are a good at - making themselves the victim, and making her child feel like she's a victim too."
3,qah1jv,Get Out (2017)

Also lol at white women tears, classic. 

Don't have anything constructive to say, but yeah that's a crap situation. Glad (and continue to hope) your spouse has your back."
7,qah1jv,"Well... don't really think you should have yelled at the kid without even explaining why what she did was wrong. The kid probably has no idea that it's offensive. You could have at least explained why, even if it is her own parents' job to do so (they clearly failed)."
8,qah1jv,"I’d be interested to see this in r/Amitheasshole if you don’t mind posting it there. 

I don’t know how old the niece is but I might have said something along the lines of “please don’t do that. It’s not a nice thing to do”"
9,qah1jv,"I agree that the SIL has some red flags. She's also overreacting and playing victim because you called her kid loudly and told her to stop.

> crying all afternoon

Oh come on.

As for the kid (calling her name loudly), it depends on how old she is, but you maybe could've handled this a little better if she's super young. Sometimes pre-Kers and young kids copy things and they don't know it's offensive.

If you explained to the kid why it's wrong and the mom *still* has an issue, then you'd know 100% and expose her."
10,qah1jv,"You could have taken her to one side and explained that what she did wasn’t very nice and it was hurtful. Be specific. Tell her what she did and why it’s wrong and that she shouldn’t be doing that, it’s serious. Tell her she’s a big girl and you’ve heard she’s a kind and caring person that people can trust so you’re really disappointed that she would do that. Explain that you don’t want to see it again or you’ll have no choice but to have a chat with Mom about it."
11,qah1jv,"Nearly every response is “you should’ve done this or that” but I honestly think I would’ve responded the same way. You had a right to be upset and that kid obviously learned that from somewhere. It *is* the responsibility of the parent to explain why something their kid did is wrong. 

And then for your SIL to cry and make it about her? Lol. I’m sorry OP, I would not have the patience for that either. Hang in there."
12,qah1jv,">Yes, Mom has all the right yard signs.

God I fucking hate fake-ass ""woke"" Karen's."
13,qah1jv,"I am horrified by all these comments saying it is on you to teach white people what racism is, whether they are a child or not. You are completely right that this is pure white fragility coming from Mom. She is also blatantly using her white privilege by saying that it is not her job to teach her kids about what it means to not be white. Somehow it falls upon POCs to teach white children how to not be racist?! Hells no. That is the white parents' job, unless they want or don't care if their kids grow up to be racist adults...in which case, keep doing what you're doing, Mom. You did everything right by intervening in the moment with the child and catching it in real time. After that, the parents need to take over, and Mom massively failed in that moment."
14,qah1jv,"Your SIL making it all about herself reminds me of how many lynchings began with a white woman doing the same thing, and is a red flag for continuing to have a relationship with this person, on a go-forward. 

I'd 86 this dumb lady from my life post-haste."
15,qah1jv,"You were in your right to do that, but without hearing your tone/volume, it’s hard to assess. The niece was certainly obnoxious but it sounds like a kid playing based on what she saw in a cartoon."
16,qah1jv,"These other comments on this thread are right in that you should explain to the child.


But I must say, the snowflake family deserved it."
17,qah1jv,"What makes a good parent isn’t just treating their own child extra special, it’s treating them how you think every kids deserves to be treated. Just my thoughts.

I think you made a mistake by telling her kid off without explaining why to the kid. You wouldn’t do that to your kid, right? But I also think how the mom handled it was a mistake too. Playing victim and teaching her child to play victim instead of owning mistakes.

The niece definitely learned it from somewhere and could totally not know why it was wrong."
18,qah1jv,"That SIL talks as if it’s totally fine for her to see other adults parent her children. I have encountered people within my family who are NOT okay with you giving a lecture to their kids or trying to teach them any manners. The same push back would’ve been said even if he made the kid’s actions “a teachable moment.” 

You’re fucked if you do and fucked if you don’t."
19,qah1jv,"That last sentence makes me sad 🥺

Ideally I wouldn’t *hope* for my SO to stand up for me and our child. I would want to *know* they’ll do so"
20,qah1jv,">Yes, Mom has all the right yard signs.

i'm sorry for your situation, but this made me chuckle."
21,qah1jv,The mom crying all day sounds like white tears. I got yelled at for far less as a kid and *I'm* white. You have every right to be offended. It's disrespectful of the child even if they're just imitating. Racism is traumatizing.
22,qah1jv,"It’s good you told her to stop but the kid needs to learn why what she did was wrong. You have to explain and make things real for children. 

As for the grandma. She’ll be okay."
23,qah1jv,"Good job, fuck them haters. We have been passive for too long. ppl expect us to fight back with hands tied, and consider everyone's feelings (except our own) at the same time. You probably prevent a future Karen."
24,qah1jv,This is so tough but you absolutely did the right thing.
25,qah1jv,I don't think you did anything wrong.  Hopefully that kid will learn that there are consequences for her actions.  Some people on this thread are thinking that asking nicely gets people to stop things like that.  It doesn't.  People are used to making fun of Asians and having the object of their mockery bow subserviently and say sooo solly.
26,qah1jv,"You turned what could’ve been a teachable moment into drama. If this was AITA, I’d say ESH. You’re an adult male losing it at a child who didn’t know any better. If your SIL was the one to do it, feel free to lose your shit, and I wouldn’t think you were an asshole at all. But idk, losing it at a child when you could’ve explained it at that very moment so your niece could connect the situation and doing silly faces like the one she did as offensive, are you really happy at how you treated your niece?"
27,qah1jv,"It depends on how old your niece is. If she's young then you can't talk to her like she's an adult. Of course, this doesn't mean being condescending but it does mean you have to make an extra effort to explain why. In her eyes, she believes she did something bad/wrong and that's going to sit in the back of her mind until she gets a reason or think of one herself (which isn't always a positive eval of herself). 

Plus, what do you mean she ""pulled her eyes""? Do you mean the thing that EVERY person does (using hands to stetch skin UNDER eyes and making funny faces)? If so, I definitely think you were too harsh esp if she was just trying to be a good cousin. But either way, communication is key. It doesn't matter who's right or wrong (doesn't matter tbh) you need to validate her feelings, offer your side, but be willing to accept that you may have been too mean... bc if the dust doesn't settle there will be more family in-fighting, hard feelings, and picking sides (esp for your wife). Glad you reached out here too bc tbh partners will almost always support/back you so not always impartial."
28,qah1jv,[deleted]
29,qah1jv,"The Mom being over-dramatic doesn't really make me want to side with her and I do think she has more fault than you simply because she's made it all about herself...

Although obviously you both are just being defensive parents, that's just natural parental instincts. You don't want your kid made fun, especially not in a racist manner, which is understandable. She doesn't want her kid yelled at doing something she probably just didn't know was bad, which also is understandable.

Switch shoes and see it from each other's standpoints.

Like you wouldn't want your kid to be yelled at for something he just didn't know. You would hope other adults can be kind in teaching him, even if it is a sensitive topic for that adult. 

And Mom probably wouldn't want her kid being made fun of for their features either, and she probably wouldn't like it if the parent didn't apologize about it to acknowledge how it could make her daughter feel regardless of the intent.

If you both would be able to see it from each other's shoes a bit more then you'd probably be able to come to a consensus...although again I feel like the Mom is going to be more of the issue here than you are."

Unfortunately also read that the episode had pretty low ratings, even compared to the rest of the season so far.  I know BTS fans are probably more into clips on YT and such and it also had to compete with NBA playoffs (I think?) but it's still unfortunate for their debut on SNL to be a ratings dip."
1,bd23uf,This is amazing but I still feel so weird seeing them all over the place because I used to get bullied for even mentioning their name a few years ago lol

I can't tell if it's just a particular niche of people or not, though, and whenever a BTS fan tells me that they really are huge, I still find myself questioning how true it is."
5,bd23uf,"People keep saying BTS and Blackpink being mainstream is good for AA's but I don't really see it. If anything, I've noticed an uptick in koreaboos and fetishization. I doubt many AA's look anything like kpop stars or want to. I don't understand why kpop is even on this sub.

Meanwhile, Andrew Yang has his CNN Townhall yesterday, his biggest MSM appearance yet, and it's not even mentioned on this sub. I mean this is the first time in my life I can remember seeing an East Asian-American on TV running for president, and it's less talked about than kpop, CRA, and To All The Boys I've Loved. Like what is the point of this sub?"

She goes to their bingo events and has so much fun. Isolation is a huge thing for older adults right now because of COVID, but to add the increased violence against Asian Americans, language barrier, and lack of knowledge of resources, makes it extra isolating."
2,tq8vvn,"Probably also a language barrier thing in terms of staying social and having hobbies besides work. I see it in my aunts and uncles who have retired in the last few years and besides work and playing cards they didn’t have many hobbies. Coupled with not having outlets for socializing with others, I can imagine it gets pretty lonely. I’m honestly concerned about my dad who doesn’t know any English and only knows about working hard. It’s fine going to be tough for him when he retires."
3,tq8vvn,"Asian Americans don't have generational wealth. I'm talking wealth as in money as well as other forms such as social capital.  

While the current generations may be relatively high achievers. We don't have legacy. How many of you have parents or much less grandparents who reached the level of success as yourself. How many of them have broad deeply rooted networks of rich social capital. If your family personally does then look around to your Asian American peers. There's no way all of their family has this deeply root generational wealth too.  

We're seen as rich but in reality we're not. It's a very shallow look at the state of affairs. It will take another few generations for Asian Americans to establish real old money type capital. By extension support systems for Asian elders."
4,tq8vvn,"The higher the expectations, the lower the satisfaction?"
5,tq8vvn,">Among Asian Americans, Korean elders reported the lowest level of life satisfaction, at 40 percent. Less than one-third of Korean participants said they received needed social and emotional support, compared to nearly two-thirds of Chinese and Filipino respondents.

This is interesting - I wonder why. haha I can't help. but think of my fellow Koreans and just never being satisfied with anything in general   
Are our elders expecting/wanting support from us, their children, or from social services and peers?"
6,tq8vvn,Asian *American elders. I imagine Asian elders on average are more happy than American elders.
7,tq8vvn,[deleted]
8,tq8vvn,"Part of it is definitely because we, younger generations, don’t protect them and fulfill our filial duties. There is no repercussion for someone to attack them. New York Asians mobilized against the new prison being built in Chinatown though, so I believe we can do it for our elders!"

On the other hand, I know a lot of gay Asians that have preferences for white dudes. In fact, I've only seen two types of queer people that specify that they prefer white or don't date Asians: white dudes and Asian dudes. Discrimination in gay dating is a real problem, but I'd be lying if I said that Asians don't perpetuate it either. White gay dudes think that being oppressed cancels out their racism and too many gaysians go along with it. What I'm getting at is that there are some internalized beliefs that the gay Asian community needs to examine.

2,vgywjx,"I had the exact opposite turn. I was very conservative before the trump era/covid. A self proclaimed ""libertarian.""

The trump era really opened my eyes to how a lot of conservatives really don't fucking care about me, not to mention how much of a joke the president was. He literally speaks like he has brain damage, and yet people suckle his cock like he is the second coming of christ.

Had one my conservative friends get mad that ""the Georgia shooting was deemed a hate crime."" This guy is pretty intelligent too, but he just can't see past his own biases. If a relatively smart guy has an attitude like that, the average Trump supporter scares me even more."
3,vgywjx,I’m for whoever can provide better mental health for the country.
4,vgywjx,"Fuck Democrats, but fuck Republicans harder."
5,vgywjx,"Democrats, from what I gathered, have lost their ways. Based on what is happening in San Francisco, it isn't hard to see why Asian Americans are leaning towards being politically moderate.

At this point, I do believe that democrats are, unfortunately, the lesser of the two evils. From experience, the GOP pushes out more racist rhetoric than democrats."
6,vgywjx,What other choice do we have?
7,vgywjx,"I see this ""canary in the coal mine"" assessment every election year about how Asians are becoming less Democratic but I have yet to see this bear out.

Obviously Asians are not a monolith and it is difficult to draw trends from our diverse population. But already I knew without clicking the article that CNN was going to talk about the Chesa Boudin recall, which was a local election with specific local issues that isn't broadly generalizable to the wider country. Those Asians in SF are more or less still voting Democratic. This is SF. People who aren't from the Bay Area and don't understand the local fundamentals need to stop drawing trends from this recall.

The second argument CNN makes is that Biden's polling among Asians is lower now than in 2020. Well guess what folks, it's a midterm election and Biden's polling is down across the board.

CNN compares it with the electorate overall, but as a tiny slice of the polling respondents, they are more prone to wild swings.

Democrats DO need to pay more attention to the Asian community. That message is fine.

I just get very annoyed because every election for the past decade has had these kinds of pieces proliferate about how Asians are conservative and Asians don't vote for Democrats and I can't help but fewl it's some wider narrative to establish Asians as white adjacent.

In 2020 Asians voted for Biden by 70%. It will probably be less this year in the midterm, maybe the swing will be even larger than the general population, but call me skeptical that this is indicative of any trend."
8,vgywjx,"There are a lot of candidates and republicans wives who are Asian so it makes sense for this to skew republican. Some of my aunties love Elaine Chao and are getting more into politics as a result. All Asian Americans should have to vote, our political voice is too small."
9,vgywjx,"I can sympathize with things like the SFUSD board members recall.  They epitomized what I dislike about radical progressivism within the Democratic party.  

Stuff like renaming schools based on information they found on Wikipedia, denying a potential Parent Advisory Council volunteer because he is white, dismantling merit-based admissions at Lowell High School in the name of defeating racism, and a general narcissism in the way they conduct their public communications.  

Given that the SFUSD board members were recalled, that gives me hope that the Democrats can become a more ideal party that is more representative of my views.  I do not have this same hope for Republicans.  The best Republicans are anti-Trump and no one in the party supports them."

Though I'm not a Republican the GOP seems to be better at innovating and changing political strategies with the times much better then the Democrats.  I voted for Biden but he will lose this next election 100% bc the Democrats have become a one-trick pony."
15,vgywjx,"Despite the increasing appeal of the Republican Party, the vast majority of Asian Americans are opposed to them as they are a vehicle for White Supremacists in advancing their sinister agenda.

On top of this, the values of the Republican Party represent almost everything wrong in society:

* Letting tens of thousands die a year by standing in the way of substantive healthcare reform
* Encouraging lax attitudes in the fight against the pandemic, killing thousands of Americans.
* Amplifying hate against Asians, Hispanics, Blacks, Muslims, the LGBT community, etc.
* Reversing critical progress in the fight against climate change
* Etc, etc, etc.

My hot take is that Biden is actually doing close to as good of a job he can with his role. The issue is more with local democrats and the senate/house. The worst of worst are dems like Manchin or Sinema who torpedo the dem's ability to anything. The political gridlock prevents any actionable change from happening, even as Dems control the house.

When early voting begins Tuesday in Texas, Linh Khong plans to set aside her schedule to fulfill her top priority: casting a vote in the 2020 presidential election.

The 42-year-old Houston optometrist said she has been a Republican since immigrating to the U.S. from Vietnam in 1980. But on Saturday afternoon, she clutched a poster and wore a face mask that were both navy blue.

“For the first time, I feel the need to vote for the party that stands for integrity, that stands for humanity,” Khong said. “I’m going out of my zone in order to vote for Joe Biden.”

Khong was among roughly 30 people who gathered Saturday afternoon at a parking lot on Bellaire Boulevard in southwest Houston for a rally organized by the grassroots group Vietnamese Americans for Biden.

Five similar rallies took place across the country, said Alex Le, a co-founder of the organization’s Houston branch and 23-year-old graduate student of public health. Vietnamese Americans have been left out of the national political conversation, by both Democrats and Republicans, Le said.

“Our votes are critical,” Le told the crowd. “So many of us are middle class working Americans and we are suffering from the pandemic. Our small businesses are closed or we have been laid off and we’ve been the victims of anti-Asian American hate crime and xenophobia. But our voices matter, we matter.”

The ralliers cheered, holding Biden/Harris signs and American flags alongside the yellow and red flag of South Vietnam. Traffic roared on the busy street. Some cars honked or yelled in support, others shouted in opposition with rude hand gestures. A block down the street was blanketed in Trump signs.

Asian Americans are the fastest growing voter group, said Rep. Gene Wu, D-Houston. He urged people to show up to the polls and vote for Biden, “the one candidate who is going to respect our community and protect us.”

The rally took place beneath a now-controversial billboard. Local businessman Le Hoang Nguyen posted a Black Lives Matter message this summer. In response, some community members called to boycott his businesses and sent death threats.

Now, the sign has a new slogan painted in white letters on thick red and blue stripes: “Lifelong Republican for Biden. Country before party.”

Le, who led Saturday’s protest, said he wanted to rally beneath the billboard because its message of unity echoes that of his group and the Biden campaign. It is also situated in the heart of Houston’s Vietnamese neighborhood.

“We’re not just Democrats or Republicans or independent, we’re all human beings,” Le said. “Everybody has a stake in this election, especially within the Vietnamese community.”

Many supporters of President Donald Trump are very vocal, Le said. He hoped the rally would demonstrate that there is a place for members of the Vietnamese American community to support Biden, too.

Vietnamese Americans were more likely to vote for President Trump than other Asian Americans, according to the [results of a national survey](https://aapidata.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/aavs2020_crosstab_national.html) published in September.

The survey, conducted by APIAVote, AAPI Data and Asian Amerians Advancing Justice, found that 48% of Vietnamese Americans were inclined to vote for Trump, while 36% were inclined to vote for Biden.

Meanwhile, 30% of Asian Americans overall supported Trump, while 54% of respondents preferred Biden.

Multiple rally attendees said their parents were staunch Republican voters, but noted that that there is a vast generational divide among Vietnamese Americans.

“There’s an attitude among the older members of the community that America is fine the way it is, but at the same time the younger generation brings with it a different perspective shaped by our growing up here,” Le said.

Thu Dinh, an engineer who came to the U.S. roughly 30 years ago, said she supports Biden because he is an honest and kind man. Meanwhile, she said she thinks Trump is a danger to the country.

“He try to suppress the press and try to attack anyone that go against him and he try to gain power as much as he can,” Dinh said. “Yeah I mean, very similar with those communist countries.”"
1,j9rjzt,This makes me feel hopeful. There’s so many Vietnamese communities that are blindly pro-Trump because they think that equates to anti-communism.

I’m used to us getting bullied because we’re perceived as weird and weak. And this year, COVID tacked on another reason for others to be nasty to us. Fantastic.

For Kamala (and Andrew Yang) to do this knowing the real impact they can have makes me incredibly grateful.

0,m7qb87,"As an Asian-American who is already deep in the firearm hobby, I just want to note/remind any fellow Asian-Americans who are looking into buying their first gun(s) to be sure to learn the basics of firearm safety as soon as you can, even if that's before buying your first gun!

Also, be sure to train with what you buy and what you plan to use for self-defense; not knowing your weapon and/or your setup as well as not being well practiced with them can be just as dangerous as not knowing your gun safety!

-----

Purchasing notes: 

If you're looking at lower cost/high-value semi-auto rifles, I'd advise taking a look at brands like ~~Palmetto State Armory~~ Aero Precision and the Smith and Weston M&P series. They might not be the cheapest rifles on the market, but they are tough rifles without un-necessary flares that just exist to increase the price.

As for pistols: Glocks, Springfields, and Sigs are popular but I would also recommend taking a look at other brands too. As personal preference, I know that Glocks and Sigs great guns, but I don't like the feel of them; Glocks feel a bit too blocky and flat in my hand and Sigs feel like they're made of people with much bigger hands than mine.

One pistol brand that I would highly recommend is CZ. CZ's feel and work really great for me; they're balanced in the hand, fit in the hand very naturally, and are very easy to upgrade. They're also (usually) not as expensive as many other brands despite being arguably equal or better in quality and finish at their price levels."
1,m7qb87,"As always when guns are mentioned:

1) Treat every gun as if it were loaded;

2) Never point the muzzle at anything you do not wish to destroy;

3) Keep your finger away from the trigger until you are ready to shoot;

4) Always be aware of your target and what is beyond it.

But for the love of whatever people consider holy, don't use this moment in time to live out your counterstrike/CoD fantasy. Or because you wan't something ""tacticool."" I yelled at my brother in law the other day because he wanted a Desert Eagle. 

As someone who is pro-2A, let me say this. Guns aren't a fucking joke. They aren't toys. They're a tool and a very dangerous one. I've been shooting for 20 years now and while I love guns, I'm still afraid of them. That fear is respect. 

If you're serious, take a safety course, and buy something reliable and easy to maintain. Treat this like buying your first car. You don't start with a Lambo, you start with a Civic or a Corolla. No you do not need a .50 Desert Eagle. No you don't need a Sig Sauer because the Navy Seals use it. No you don't need an AR-15 with Magpul accessories and Trijicon Scope. No you do not need .40, a fucking 9mm is fine. You don't need kevlar with ceramic plating. 

You need a basic, straight shooting, reliable firearm that can protect you. That being said, I suggest a Glock for handgun and a Mossberg 500 as your first shottie.

Edit: Let me clarify by stating that there's nothing wrong with getting cool guns or upgrades. I do it also. Just take it slow and know your way around the basics of a firearm care, safety protocol and properly shooting before you go off in the deep end."

I do see a lot of people commenting on Warren's admittingly embarassing gaffe with her ""Native American heritage."" And it just overall makes me worried about the Democratic lineup. Kamala Harris was the recent big name that dropped, but if you think Warren has skeletons in her closet. Actually, nevermind Warren, Hillary's reputation was massively damaged by the ""Superpredators comment"" she made in the 90's. Harris actually put that into practice when she was Attorney General, levying heavy sentences and ruining the lives of African American males some of whom either didn't even deserve a heavy sentence or were straight up innocent. 

If Bernie ran then the other candidates wouldn't even have a chance. At the same time, Bernie has that sexual harassment thing going for him. And the most important factor which is the fact that by the time the elections role around, he'll be 79. I mean its no secret that being President is the equivalent of the accelerated ageing in Metal Gear Solid 4, I myself a Bernie fan wonder if he could handle it. 

Beto O'Rourke has a sketchy voting history as well, but his sins aren't as extensive as Warren's or Harris's, and as evidenced by his presence in El Paso, he is still massively popular. But of course there's a still a low chance that he even wants to run. 

Joe Biden would basically be the vanilla bet, but even then I don't know how he'll fare in winning over people who voted for Trump. 

Andrew Yang's been to the DNC and he has already stated that the DNC won't be as stupid as to do what they did with Hillary again. But I seriously hope for the sake of the country they could get their shit together. "

> Barker will reportedly be placed under The Women’s Project (TWP)], a community that seeks to permanently decrease the number of women in city jails and state prisons. According to its website, TWP is part of a larger partnership between nonprofits Wildcat and The Fedcap Group, public defenders and district attorney offices in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx.

Also:

> While on release, Barker will be under strict electronic monitoring. She will also receive “supportive housing so that her location will be known, regular check-ins and accompaniment to each court appearance to ensure her return to court,” according to Bragg’s office.

The DA didn't release her, he remanded her to a program that aims to rehabilitate her. If you think that this is deserving of significant jail time, you're messed up. 

We already have one of the if not the most prisoners per capita because of our punitive carceral system. Studies show that prison actually increases crime instead of deterring it. We need more alternatives to prison, not less.

And if you think you can find alliance with the people who really hate Bragg and want to roll back parole reform, think again - they don't believe violence against Asians is a thing. I know, I canvassed these people in the lead up to the June Assembly elections. They're not our friends."
10,walida,"The justice system won’t punish criminals for hurting you, but if you dare to defend yourself then be prepared to be scrutinized and punished in a way that these criminals never will be."
11,walida,"I honestly have no problem with this. This woman is a hateful Karen. Publish her name, get her fired, fine her, that's all good. Punishment should be proportional to the crime, which, by the way, IS NOT THE ISSUE here as she still has to go to trial. 

For the West Coasters:

If she had been rich she would have walked out anyway, every time bail comes up there's all these stupid articles. 

What some posters seem to want is to change the law so that an accused for certain crimes (violent?) CANNOT get bail. This is closer to a Napoleonic system of law and not the innocent before proven guilty we're supposed to have. 

I lived in a country where it was military law - the cops would arrest you and you had to languish in jail until trial. Remember that our courts are so backed up trials are months in the future - false arrests can and do happen. 

I know a guy who was handing off the child in a police station with the ex wife. They had been fighting for custody for years. They are both pieces of shit but that's beside the point. The woman accused the man of lunging and attacking him so the cops arrested him. He had to sit in Riker's for the weekend before he was processed out.

The judge yelled at the cops because they could have seen the security cameras for the precint clearly showed he did not approach her."

1,taiz71,It’s open season on Asians.  Protect yourself and be careful out there.
2,taiz71,[deleted]
3,taiz71,"We really need to employ military tactics just to stay safe anymore. By military tactics I mean sitting so you're facing the entrances, knowing your exit routes, watching each individual for any suspicious activity, head on a swivel 24/7. 

Recently went to Chicago on a bus and I don't think I've been on such a high alert ever. I was constantly on lookout with my hand near my knife just in case. I've never walked around armed, but since this Covid shit spiked the AAPI attacks I don't leave home without a knife anymore. Each day I get closer to wanting to get a license and a concealed carry."
4,taiz71,"What American politicians don't realize (or care even if they knew) is that this rising hate crime trend is not something that they can just ignore

America has been relying on immigrants to fill its universities and power its workforce (particularly in STEM) for decades now. But folks back in Asia are noticing this rapid rise in crime, and it's making America less of a desirable place to live

Meanwhile, AAPI in the USA is living under these conditions, and many are re-evaluating their status in the USA. Some consider moving back to Asia, others simply become alienated and increasingly resentful of the USA"
5,taiz71,"There's a video of the incident/attack that shows the attacker fairly clearly that's out there on some of the online news websites. If anyone in the NY area happens to recognize or see this individual, be cautious, keep your distance and call 911. Otherwise, protect yourself and keep your head on a swivel!"

0,nptq6x,I didn’t know that anyone actually still said this in 2021. But now they know
1,nptq6x,It's a small phrase that is instantly dehumanizing to an Asian woman. Good article.
2,nptq6x,I never knew the origins of the phrase (from Full Metal Jacket) so this was very informative for me - thanks for sharing!
3,nptq6x,">her teenage male Vietnamese-American cousins in Miami, who were laughing and pointing at the Full Metal Jacket scene on TV. “I remembered being confused and upset.”

I would assume blissful ignorance, they think being American puts them in a different category than the Asians depicted in the film"
4,nptq6x,"The Chicago woman who was referenced in the article had a friend who stood up for her. The racist VP who sent the email threatened her friend with a libel lawsuit after standing up for her. 

Can't be libel if you wrote it yourself, fool. Like calling someone a ""big-lipped Negro"" in an email, and then pretending just because it's from a movie it's not racist. You used the phrase to reference someone else in a completely different setting."

6,nptq6x,"I'm a man, so I have a different relation to this phrase, perhaps. I imagine I'd be incensed if this was dropped on me in an orientalizing way. The one time I encountered it, verbatim, was in Saigon from a street walker (""Me love you long time, all night etc,"" said to me). I could be wrong, but my sense is that it's a pat phrase that is still in use among sex workers."

His hard core fans are all alike this, all pieces of trash."
1,fjwjv1,"Fucker. 
I hate him so much."
2,fjwjv1,Whenever I see things like this I gotta say it. Where are those Asian people that were cheering for him when the elections were happening and needed more concrete proof when all those racist incidents were happening toward Asians after the election. Just staying quite
3,fjwjv1,Trump’s putting a target on the back of Asian-Americans in an attempt to divert attention from his incompetent crisis response.

OK maybe hes trying to point fingers at China's gov and retaliate the conspiracy theory promoted by state tabloid Global Times.

But hey, Xi Jinping ain't got no punch in the face by some angry ""patriots"" on the streets. It's Asian AMERICANS who will be hurt! And Asian kids at school? Oh boy, certainly school bullies know the nuance between referencing a foreign nation and referencing a group of people, right?

12,fjwjv1,"I don’t blame him. They didn’t start using the term “Chinese Coronavirus” UNTIL China tried to frame the US Navy for bringing the virus to China, which everyone knows is not true. He’s just doing this because China is trying to brand it as an American Coronavirus. That’s why he has to emphasize that it’s from China, not America."

0,txpopm,"By far Hawaii - down to Earth and great melting pot of Asians. Southern California was painful, but I felt less conspicuous - I finally understood the superficiality that people complain about.

Worse places actually was Philadelphia for open racism. The South was just subtle persistent racism."
1,txpopm,"Best: major cities in Texas, notably the suburbs of Dallas and Houston. So much representation from different Asian countries and a feeling of solidarity. Plus affordable, authentic Asian food!  

Worst: Portland, Oregon. The passive aggressive othering was worse for me than the occasional rude comment in the Northeast (I’ve lived in NYC and Boston). Also, due to historical laws restricting minority residence in the PNW, there’s still a lack of diversity in the region. It was rare to see another non-white person out and about."
2,txpopm,"I've had a pretty bad time in the military. Microaggressions, aloofness from leadership, generally intolerant right-wing culture that obliviously only puts white people in the highest positions of power."
3,txpopm,[deleted]
4,txpopm,"I lived in the South (SC/NC/AR) for around 10 years and found affluent old south to be the worst. There were some really cool folks in the South too, but the few bad apples were really bad.

I've had nice experiences living in New England (CT/ME), Colorado Springs, Hawaii, and NorCal."
5,txpopm,"I've only ever lived in the south until recently so my experience is limited. Plus I'm mixed so while a place might be great for Asian Americans, it won't be great for my other half (African American) and vice versa. But in my experience, the south is meh for Asian Americans. There are pockets where there are more Asian Americans and different towns and markets to get good food and such but you have to go out of your way and search for it. Otherwise, its rare. Plus in my personal experience, people are more racist towards Asians than other minorities simply because they view everything so black and white down here. I've had to call out people for being so racist about my Asian heritage and they tend to not take it as seriously as when I call them out for racism for my black heritage. But that might just be a general thing and the whole ""model minority/privilege"" bs."
6,txpopm,"The North is very Clique/Enclave-y...  be it the Amish in Lancaster, Muslims in Michigan, Jews in New York, Chineses in New York, well, pretty much everyone in New York... ""Don't bother us, we won't bother you"" seems to be the uneasy truce that most live by."
7,txpopm,"I'm from California and have lived in both the Bay Area and LA. I have still encountered a lot of racism here. But the Asian population / restaurants / groceries / desserts!!!! cannot be matched. 

I visited a friend who lives in a suburb of St. Louis and was actually impressed. There was good Asian food and decent boba. Certainly nowhere the selection that California has, but there were even Cantonese bakeries and some Asian grocery stores. Also, nobody stared at us while we were out in public. My friend loves living in St. Louis. 

My boyfriend grew up in the South (Tennessee), fled to California after graduation, and will not consider moving back despite the high COL here. We visited a few years ago and got so many stares. He had advised me to dress/look as nondescript as possible because we would already be standing out so much as Asians. I thought he was exaggerating but he wasn't. Also, the boba options were few and not good."
8,txpopm,"Lived in California (been all over, my home state), the Midwest, the east, and randomly for a year, London.

Fuck rural anywhere. Fuck no. Never again. I would choose London over rural anywhere in America. I have more in common with urban city dwellers in London than rural America, that’s the sad fucking truth."
9,txpopm,"Worst: Driving through rural Mississppi and Alabama was weird. Even New Orleans (while super fun, unique, beautiful, etc) didn't feel great.

edit: 
Eastern Colorado was the worst, a had guy stare me down at the gas station, and a family wouldn't enter McDonald's after my family went in. They saw us going in and just noped out of there. 

Also in touristy mountain town in Colorado at an ice cream parlour, the white workers would ignore us, serving white people behind us until a Latino worker served us."
10,txpopm,Both California. Just by living here. Some people don’t like Asians 🤡
11,txpopm,"Best: Cities where a substantial amount of Asians reside, and the affluent areas of California, including the OC where I live. 

Worst: Anywhere “ghetto”, trashy”, or without a substantial amount of Asians—When I was a kid, I was intensely bullied, called derogatory names, and treated  harshly by other non-Asian minorities. I felt the most safe with my Asian and white friends. As an adult, I don’t experience that anymore, but I do stick out like a sore thumb in terms of mannerisms and lifestyle. I’m also more concerned about being physically harmed or robbed (again). 

Also, areas where Indonesians mainly congregate. I’m told that I’m not a “real” Indonesian because I’m very light-skinned and mixed, and I get shamed for not being able to speak the language fluently. (But I can understand it; so if anyone talks trash behind my back… 😉)"
12,txpopm,"I grew up in the northeast and then moved to the Midwest and have spent time in the south. Northeast certainly has its issues, but people not being nice is kind of just a northeast thing… people aren’t very nice to strangers no matter what race you are."
13,txpopm,"Grew up in the northeast myself, if you’re not from the area I can understand why it’s harsh.  Everyone is unfriendly to everyone else here, it’s suburban carryover from the Boston and New Yorker attitudes.  But it’s very much a “you leave me alone and I’ll leave you alone” type place.  

In terms of safety, almost all the states are below national homicide rates and NJ/NY/CT/RI/MA are all about education.  And if you had grown up here you’d likely have been raised on ice skating, skiing, or snowboarding so there’s usually something to look forward to in the winter.  

Granted this is just speaking from the suburban experience, growing up in Brooklyn I’m sure is a different world.  The typical route most Asians go in the NE seems to be 

Born here -> Raised in white majority but still diverse academic suburb with maybe 5-10% Asians -> Attend top 50 university -> Move to NYC / Boston / Philly as an adult.  From there a few will go to Cali, or Chicago, some even overseas to start businesses.  Many stay local and eventually marry and move back into the suburbs to repeat the process.  Over the past 25 something years northern and central NJ has seen an explosion in suburban Asian communities."
14,txpopm,">Worst: Anywhere in the Northeast

I live in the northeast and it's not even close to being the worst. Try rural Appalachia or rural plains states."
15,txpopm,"Seen a lot of microaggressions in CA, especially against members of our community with poor English skills.

White-only rural areas are a bit weird, but if you live somewhere where racial politics is exclusively black and white, its a different experience."
16,txpopm,"The Northeast has lots of Asian enclaves. Sure there’s some resentment from old timers, but for the most part it’s pretty good. Your comment about money really has more to do with “do you have money”. 

I agree with your point on Hawaii."
17,txpopm,"We live in Honolulu now and it’s wonderful. Huge Asian population and I never feel any hostility. Except from tourist.  Grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area and it wasn’t bad, but lived in Reno and I felt really outta place."
18,txpopm,"Best: Los Angeles in the San Gabriel Valley. When you live in a municipality that's 50%+ Asian, you just have a buffer.

Unexpected 2nd-best: non-Louisville, non-Lexington Kentucky. People definitely look at you strangely and do a double take, but then they bend over backwards to try to show they aren't racist. It's a very interesting dynamic. You can read more about it in the book MY OWN COUNTRY, about an Indian physician who did his residency in rural Kentucky because nobody else would accept someone with foreign training.

Worst: Madison, WI. Lots of passive-aggression with a racial tinge, including the time some granola flannel asshole who looked like he hadn't bathed in 3 days gave me the finger for no reason, along with the psycho who got out of his car and walked towards mine because he thought I was tailgating him.

Second-worst: honestly, a lot of the liberal northeast. Less overt displays of racism than that white liberal-leftist sanctimonious on race that has no trouble making all manner of ignorant and nativist statements about Asians."
19,txpopm,"I've only really lived in the Seattle area, so I have a limited view, but I've heard Seattle is pretty good for Asian-Americans. There can be a bit of rivalry/negative feelings between Asian-Americans south of Seattle vs north Seattle and east across Lake Washington due to financial differences though, so that might be pretty divisive compared to other places"
20,txpopm,I visited Hawaii recently and was shocked at how comfortable I felt. Is this what white people feel all the time?
21,txpopm,"The worst direct racism I remembered was Arizona. I live in California and I have not heard or experienced anything like that for a very long time. 

Also I felt a distinct difference between pre-Trump and post-Trump era in less urban areas in the south. People were at least polite to me before when I visited. And now it feels like they are emboldened to cast stares and give open hostilities to non-whites once they put their red hats on in groups."
22,txpopm,"Northeast isn’t so bad. Took a short Labor Day weekend trip to Boston from New York back in 2007 and made friendly banter with an old dude, some proprietor of a restaurant. His only issue was finding out we were from NY (he had the Boston accent, we didn’t have a New Yorker one). Told us jokingly to leave. Afterwards I had to tell my friends “Look, we can’t hide that we’re Asian, but don’t tell anyone we’re from New York let alone Yankees fans!”"
23,txpopm,"My worst isn't the worst on the spectrum if I compared it to what friends and acquaintances have experienced. For me it's mostly lingering eyes, avoidance, or me feeling out of place -- maybe only a handful of direct confrontations.

To me most people are chill and pleasant to interact with overall. Grew up in a 4% asian demographic in north San Diego where it's mostly Filipino and Vietnamese.

Best: California -- San Diego (Mira Mesa/National City), Orange County (Irvine, Fullerton, Tustin), Los Angeles (626, South Bay), and Bay Area (San Francisco, San Jose, Oakland)

Neutral:  Las Vegas, NV, Austin TX,  Orlando, FL, Central  (Kern County) and East border of California (Riverside County)

Worst: Arizona, Illinois, and Indiana outside the large cities"
24,txpopm,"My job from the 1960s-2000s took me all over the US as I worked for a large international corporation.  Generally speaking, jobs in large metro areas were less stressful for being an Asian.  I'd experienced outright bigotry when attempting to access housing, dining and entertainment in many places but more commonly in the Southeast US.  Unquestionably, the most accepting area was in Hawaii and least accepting was generally in the Southern states.  There were exceptions to that and surprisingly so in the South and also almost anywhere else in the country.  I experienced outright bigotry in Southern areas but also in isolated incidences in a few Northern areas.  Most accepting was Hawaii and least accepting was almost anywhere in the Deep South.  I did experience a few incidences where I was told upfront that I was not welcome at the establishment.  On the other hand, there were a couple of incidences that I was cordially welcomed in a Southern establishment.  It was a stressful game to see if I would be accepted at an establishment or not."
25,txpopm,"Best: Hawaii (Oahu).

Worst: Texas, Midwest. Midwest was arguably more infuriating because they're the nicest racist people you'll ever meet. Especially in Minnesota."
26,txpopm,"Best: Bay Area, California & LA area

Neutral: Lawrenceville, GA (Has a substantial Korean/East Asian population, but definitely ran into some microaggressions)

Worst: Central California"
27,txpopm,"Best: NYC

Worst: Maine

Nothing direct, its just more lacking basic resources and what is there is expensive.

Meanwhile a good chunk of Queens is just a constant clash between expanding Koreans and Chinese places. 
Where there's more hangul and hanja signs than English, thats peak America 😤"
28,txpopm,Is there anywhere in the Midwest that's nice to live in as an Asian American?
29,txpopm,"Born on Long Island and have lived in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic since

Best: Southern California. Incredible food too.

Worst: Southeast like Georgia, South Carolina and parts of Florida. I had a stranger aggressively ""ni hao"" me in a grocery store parking lot just north of Jacksonville. Mostly microaggressions like that (Is \[my generic American birth name\] your real name?!) but nothing violent thankfully."
30,txpopm,"Best: parts of Austin, Houston, Pasadena, San Diego, Cupertino area

Middling: Boston, NYC, Chicago, Denver/Boulder area (nothing overt, just felt so white), New Orleans (lots of bonding over food, music, dance), Savannah was ok, parts of Florida (hanging out with Cuban Americans), it seems to depend who I’m with

Worst: rural anywhere except retreat centers,I love the Bay Area and also had the worst dating, stalking, micro aggressions, and random racist comments and behaviors from strangers in SF/Berkeley/Oakland areas, but some good food and nice folks at the airport, Twin Cities also is a mixed bag of food and daily microaggressions, PNW

This thread makes me want to visit Hawaii, and also doesn’t feel my place somehow"
31,txpopm,Yeah nah anything south or rural is the worst. Not only do I run into the most racism in those areas but I only hear bad things about it from other Asians in terms of racism. ESPECIALLY when it comes to internalized racism. You might just not be used to how people are in the Northeast but I'd take it over the rural South or Midwest any day.
32,txpopm,"Having grown up in a NJ town that is dominantly Asian and white, I never felt out of place. Then I moved to NYC for college, and it was such a melting pot. Though that's changed after the pandemic."
33,txpopm,"I would rank the Northeast/New England to actually be mild in terms of anti-Asian racism. Sure, there are Trump flags dotted around driveways in more rural areas, but you are unlikely to run into a confrontation with one of those people while going about your daily life. Living here for a long time, I haven't got a single sideways glance or racist comment since COVID started. 

As you mentioned, the racism in the NE is much more passive aggressive and bothered me more when I went to elementary and high school, but as adults, people usually mind their own business, or you can stare them down until they do. 

As for the rest of the country, I have only traveled from coast to coast with no time in the Midwest and Deep South, and I have no interest in visiting those places for many reasons, honestly."
34,txpopm,"I've never been to Cali or Hawaii before but I do want to stop by since one of my friends is out in CA. I've heard such mixed things about Cali for Asians though, so I think Hawaii is probably the safest bet. Grew up in MA/RI/CT area and can say that the Asian population around there is actually pretty high. There's some towns where the majority of folks are Asian. Though if you feel uncomfortable being in a white-predominant neighborhood, then it's probably not for you.

Middle would be Florida (from my experience). I fly down every once in a while to visit my SO's family, and I might see 3 Asians during my week-long trip. It's pretty isolating. Same situation with Maine or NH, very few Asians, and a lot of Trump supporters with access to guns. Not a very comforting place to be haha.

Worst by far is probably Tennessee, Kentucky, anywhere rural south. One of my friends from Kentucky warned me not to ever drive in the rural areas. I also want to add most major cities, like Boston or NYC. A huge melting pot of folks so the majority of it is a good time, but there's always the bad apples."
35,txpopm,"Best: DC area (DC, NoVa, Maryland) - never experienced outright racism, and microagressions only a few times a year. A lot of people have been exposed to many cultures here, so general ignorance is lower. Pockets of NoVa have up to 20% Asian-American communities.

Worst: Twin Cities - Microagressions are very high here. Had a few encounters that almost ended in fist fights. They have a large Hmong population, but def adds more stereotypes and hostility."
36,txpopm,"I've never lived in Hawaii but have visited and it's lovely, but the weather isn't really for me.

I've actually had racist moments happen to me literally everywhere I've lived, but I most recently am in western WA in a relatively diverse enclave and it's comfortable. When I lived in NJ and NYC, while most people were nice enough, I had some actually aggressive racist incidents and it made me never want to live there again. Philly always has me on edge for similar reasons. Weirdly enough, New Mexico wasn't that uncomfortable, maybe Mexicans are just more nice, even if some folks are ignorant. Never lived in California, which is probably weird as an Asian lol. When visiting it's been a mixed bag. NorCal felt pretty okay, though SF area seems like a shitshow atm. Midwest cities like Chicago and Minneapolis are friendly and I didn't have a lot of issues but rural Midwest...don't bother. Florida overall sucks. Miami is a cool city but people don't know any Asians and were often kinda rude."
37,txpopm,"From Hawaii and lived in the American south most of my life. Most of my negative experience have happened in the south, as well as “negative” experiences of people attempting to be accommodating in very innocently ignorant or fetishizing ways. 

At the same time, it’s hard to make comparisons to Hawaii or the west coast since I’ve only been there sporadically, or in hawaiis case, there when I was too young to remember."
38,txpopm,"IOWA- worst, by far…"
39,txpopm,"Best ( highly highly depends on what you mean by Asian ) as there is more cultural separation between a Korean and Vietnam than a Italian and a Germany 


With that said 

Koreans:::: ( :Los angles metro : Buena Park ca , Pasadena, garden grove , Irvine , Rowland heights ) (Hawaii : honlulu ). San Francisco : all over , ( nyc : flushing district ) (San Diego : Carsbad)

Best Viet food Westminster 

Best Cambodian food Long Beach 


Best Thai food I stress is in north Hollywood at pa ord noodle



I’ll stress this la has the greatest number of diversity and population of Asians but there is not very much cultural mixing between different groups 

Hawaii is a mix of fillpino Korean Cantonese and Japanese culture with a heavy Japanese and native Hawaiian base"
40,txpopm,"Best: it used to be New York City pre-pandemic, but obviously that’s changed a lot. Outside of that …honestly I felt very comfortable everywhere in Las Vegas.

Worst: from personal experience - Philly, since that’s when I had the first hate crime happen to me (a rando white girl in a bar pushed me and yelled out racial slurs). Second probably Virginia  and further down south. As a woman there, you are either invisible or you are aggressively stared at in the streets. No in between."
41,txpopm,"I'm mixed, but Bay Area (South Bay/Peninsula), Socal, and Boston/Cambridge have all been pretty good for me.  The northeast is definitely a mixed bag as whole, though--visiting my mom's family in rural Maine was a very different day-to-day experience than I had in Cambridge."
42,txpopm,A lot of good Asian communities in northern Va (just outside DC). Grew up there surrounded by a great Filipino community. Some ignorance to Asians but honestly felt safe and people in NOVA are pretty welcoming to the culture
43,txpopm,"Hey I’m a bit late to this post but does anyone know anything about Boston? I’m moving there in the Fall, any nuances would be greatly appreciated"
44,txpopm,"Sorry, California for me felt like I got microaggressions from other Asian American groups for being Southeast Asian rather than East Asian.

Example with me in college in UCLA with two kids I knew:

A: “You’re not really THAT Asian because you’re not Chinese, Japanese, Korean, or Vietnamese.”

C: “Uh, I AM Chinese too.”

B: “You’re only a quarter, so it doesn’t count. You’re just Filipino.”

A: “Filipinos aren’t Asians dude.”

C: “Yeah we are.”

B: “No; some say they’re Pacific Islanders.”

C: “Uh, hell no, I lived in the Philippines before and they all wonder why Fil-Ams say weird shit like that.”

A: “Nobody cares about them; but still you’re not Asian anyway.”

I didn’t get this in the Northeast at all, but they did confuse me for one group or another or didn’t know what different ethnicities there were.

What’s weird is that UCLA has a large Asian American population and best Asian American studies program.

Silver Lake also had white hipsters who were outwardly racist “ironically” and “unironically” who said things like, “Wow, first the blacks, now the Asians are coming here, like cockroaches, man!”

I don’t get why a state like California has led to weird encounters like the above and they aren’t the only ones. And I’ve lived in SF, LA, and SD in California alone, so…"
45,txpopm,"For me, the worst was California. The best was Virginia, where I live now. Visiting California multiple times I seemed to get the kind of staredowns from other Asian-Americans.

Where I live in Virginia, I guess because the Asian-American community is largely involved in the military I have experienced a lot of kindness and respect.

Of course, as always, YMMV."
46,txpopm,"Best: Surprisingly alot of major southern cities: Dallas, Houston, Austin, Atlanta

Worst: New Jersey...Fuck New Jersey, also didn't have a good time the two times I have been in Philly"
47,txpopm,People who’ve been in Northeast: do you include Vermont? A friend of mine (white) lives there and says everyone is open in general
48,txpopm,"Hawaii was awesome for me, although I wish I lived there longer. Was only there for three years in middle school.  I was pretty oblivious to my own racial identity at the time, but I definitely felt like I didn’t stick out at all on account of my name or appearance there. 

Worst was the town I otherwise grew up in, central IL. We lived in a very poor white neighborhood, and  while most people were merely indifferent, there wasn’t enough support to cancel out the open racists and neo-nazi types who would vandalize our restaurant and home with swastikas from time to time."
49,txpopm,"Best: SoCal, by far.  Perfect weather, good community, great food options.  I can survive here just fine without needing white grocery stores for anything.

I'd put San Diego and Orange County at the top of the list.  I had a less good experience in the Bay Area, but I haven't lived there for extended periods of time, so the bad interactions I had were more likely to be isolated incidents.

Another hidden gem is Houston, which gets knocked down a bit because the weather is even worse than you think it is if you haven't lived there.  The city itself is really awesome and full of good people, and there are *multiple* Vietnamese neighborhoods and plenty of good markets out west on Bellaire and in the Scarsdale area to the southeast.

Houston has good local culture for people of other Asian backgrounds, as well, but I'm more familiar with the Vietnamese parts.

The food in Houston is on par with the food in SoCal for the most part.  The Korean food in Houston is even better, and the Vietnamese food is almost as good, though with slightly less variety.

Bad: Midwest (boring, snowy) and Northeast (snowy) and most of the South (racist as hell)."

Would've been fun. It's too bad the Korean American is a single dad and didn't have a wife to bitch-slap the smug-ass White chick. Why is it so bad in New York?

0,lwuehz,">“I spoke to an Asian American woman recently who had been verbally harassed and threatened for two minutes at a restaurant after rebuffing a man’s flirtations. When the police arrived, they informed her that this type of activity was happening frequently but there was nothing they could do,” she said.

>“They didn’t take a report and they offered no resources at that time outside of offering to walk her to her car in the parking lot.”

>The woman shared a video of the incident on Instagram, and four more women came forward to say they had been victimized by the same man, she said."
1,lwuehz,Protect and serve...
2,lwuehz,I'll just say this.... I would not be surprised if there is a huge surge of Asian gangs that are formed because the lack of police support in these communities all over the US.
3,lwuehz,"I think these incidents really demonstrate that the police at large do not exist to keep us safe. Despite being one of the largest police forces in the nation, with limitless resources and an army of officers, the LAPD is proving to be rather useless at protecting people from violence within their communities.

They were more than capable of rolling out in commando gear and beating the shit out of people to suppress protests over the summer. They'll show up in force to kick you out of your home if you run behind on rent. But they won't show up to protect you or keep you safe.

This isn't an accident. It's the core nature of policing under racial capitalism. Cops exist to protect the interests of capital and to enforce racial divisions. Regardless of the feelings of the individual officer, the institution is simply not designed to ""protect and serve"" in any meaningful capacity. 

The police protect property and the rich. They are used to forcefully impose state control onto the marginalized and exploited, and they're more than happy to allow tensions between racial groups to boil over into violence. 

I think now is a great moment to examine the ways in which the Asian American community and Black communities have been played against one another to prevent the intra-racial solidarity necessary for a broader working-class movement. To me, the answer to these problems is through building that solidarity and strengthening our own communities. Not looking to our oppressors to save us."
4,lwuehz,... That's what they said with the 1992 riots happened and none of them were in sight in Koreatown.
5,lwuehz,Why would anyone trust the LAPD? We’re the only minority group that like trusts the cops and wants more of them.
6,lwuehz,"> She also cited a California auditor’s report that found the LAPD failed to investigate or label several instances as hate crimes, even though they fit that description. The state audit found that the LAPD and other California agencies did not report hate crimes to the California Department of Justice 14% of the time.

Wow. Can't tell if this is poor training or them just not giving a fuck."
7,lwuehz,"(spit take) Hahahah LAPD? *Help??*

&nbsp;
Good luck and stay safe everyone. We're on our own here :("
8,lwuehz,"I don't know why anyone would expect anything else from LAPD - if they aren't going to protect other minority groups from hate crimes, why would we expect them to do any better for Asian Americans?  


I think how institutions treat other nonwhite groups is a pretty good barometer for how they'll treat Asians as we become a more significant demographic."

2,f3dudp,"In other subreddits (like r/nyc), people were hailing this as a public health victory, since 0 cases is “impossible” with all the immigrants in the city so people must be staying home and also people are being “responsible” staying away from the people who might be sick (because ofc, all Chinese shops are staffed with people who immigrated like yesterday).  It’s a really sad and messed up state of affairs, IMO.  It really hits home for me as somebody that grew up in the Chinese takeout business.  My parents worked most of their lives in the restaurants, as did most of my aunts and uncles and cousins and various family friends, etc...  It was _not_ an easy life.  I spent many days of my childhood working behind those counters in a lower middle class neighborhood, where our delivery guys would get jumped and/or had cars stolen, where the margins were razor thin because of competition with other takeout places undercutting each other for customers who scrutinized every receipt and would argue about sales tax.  Seeing all the employees that would pass through over the years, almost all of them with families to feed, whether in tiny Queens apartments or back in China where they’d be sent money regularly and go years (sometimes decades) without seeing each other.  SARS was a bit long ago for me, at a time where I wasn’t as aware of stuff outside my little teenage bubble, but I’d imagine my parents went through a lot of the same thing.  I can’t shake the sense that if we were still in the restaurant business, we’d be feeling that same hurt and pain once again.  Guess that’s why I get sensitive when I hear all the hysteria going around now.  Because, while I respect people wanting to stay safe from harm, comments about avoiding Chinese people and businesses really affect me on a deeply personal level, especially given how well controlled the circumstances around here seem to be thus far."

Racism in these situations are incredibly hard to identify and counter, because it's difficult to know if it's general inter-personal conflict or racism.

0,wfzx7z,Everybody should play Sleeping Dogs.
1,wfzx7z,"In Prey, there’s environmental storytelling that gives away the initial twist that you’re in a loop that you can only recognize if you’re Asian— there’s a bunch of Chinese New Year red packets lying around Morgan’s apartment, even though it’s like a month after CNY. Coincidentally, this lines up with the amount of time Morgan’s been stuck in the loop, meaning their fake apartment was never modified after CNY, despite being a month later.

Also, Prey is just a good immersive sim, like Deus Ex or Bioshock, in addition to having a Chinese-American protagonist."
2,wfzx7z,"Aw, no Nick Kang from ""True Crime: Streets of LA""? He had to fight a mystical dragon in a game calling itself ""True Crime""!"
3,wfzx7z,Nick from True Crimes is the first Asian protagonists I can remember all my friends thinking was cool who wasn’t a stereotype.   Big miss.
4,wfzx7z,I liked the Drifter from Destiny 2 :) he’s pretty cool
5,wfzx7z,"Was confused then it specified american lol 

Doesnt chell from portal and faith from mirrors edge count?"
6,wfzx7z,Surprised no Faith Connors (Mirror's Edge) on list
7,wfzx7z,In the comments of that article somebody mentioned solid snake is actually a Hapa. That is mind blowing for me...
8,wfzx7z,"Not Asian American, I know — but the Yakuza series was and is amazing."
9,wfzx7z,Hoping for a Shang Chi game. I don't even need it to be good lol
10,wfzx7z,"I am unsure if video game developers should be ""forced"" to create more Asian American character. After the disaster that was Kai Leng from Mass Effect 3, I am on the side that Asian characters should be naturally included and not be added just to tick some checkmark on some race quota in video games."
11,wfzx7z,I’m surprised the article doesn’t mention the numerous awesome Asian characters in final fantasy 14 and the other games in the ff series
12,wfzx7z,"This is race baiting.  A lot of video games don't even take place on Earth or acknowledge the USA, and most beloved video game characters aren't even human."
13,wfzx7z,I'm surprised that Hunag Lee didn't get a mention.
0,vxju6d,">We’ve seen an uptick in content that is overtly negative or cynical...We ask you to report this content if you see anything of this sort and do not engage.

I worry this rule is too vague.

r/asianamerican seems to me an activist signal-boosting community, that helps Asians of all strips find common cause against the systems that harm them. With how influential subs like black + white---peopletwitter are, I think there's an opportunity to develop something of similar scale and influence here.

But, I think if the sub wants reach r/all, there needs to be discussions ironing out intra-community disagreements.

You can argue there's a very strong undercurrent of white anxiety underlying and biasing discussions of China, and I'd heartily agree.

However, the CCP's surveillance state, non-democratic government and treatment of minorities has raised legitimate concerns about the nation, just as valid as those brought up against the United States, Russia, Brazil, etc.

The CCP, to me, are a terrifying political entity, because it is potentially the coming century's Dominant Superpower; a title currently held by the United States. I don't think I need to convince you of how much control over Global conversations, norms, economic and political institutions the United States exerts because of its dominance.

On this basis, I think the Skeleton's in the CCP's closet are worth examining.

So, I guess my question is this:

*So long as the discussion and content of the post remain calm and respectful, would you allow a post like mine clearly designed to spark disagreement?*"
1,vxju6d,Speak for yourself not others is a great rule
2,vxju6d,"One thing that annoys me about this sub and a lot of other Asian diaspora-oriented subs is how disproportionately CJK-centric the content is. I get that Overseas Chinese are the largest group among the Pacific Ocean-facing-Asia diaspora in most non-Asian countries, and that Japan and South Korea have a ton of soft power, so we're not going to see as much content relating to the ASEAN or subcontinental diasporas. But the uptick in ""overly negative and cynical"" content- often relating to Asian geopolitics and specifically Beijing- seems to be steering this sub away from what I originally came here for, which was to stay informed on what's going on with Asian America and the broader Asian diaspora. 

On that note, I really hope the mods come out with a demographics poll soon. It'd be nice to see what the 2022 age and nativity profiles of this sub are..."
3,vxju6d,"I'll probably be downvoted for saying this, but I've posted and seen others post content on news related to projects by Asian women creators which have been downvoted to oblivion, while my posts about creative projects by Asian men don't seem to receive the same treatment.

These posts tend to garner cynical and negative comments that assume that whatever content these Asian women are creating will inevitably serve to uphold a white supremacy narrative. I'm not sure how this can even be addressed, but just wanted to comment.

I'm now afraid to post anything related to Asian women-led projects."
4,vxju6d,"I do feel like there has been an uptick in aggressive and misogynistic comments these days in Asian subs in general. And responding to them seems to invite these dudes to just... start stalking you.

I've had a few dudes use different accounts to follow me around to different subs referencing my other comments and checking into my account to argue. I've also received DMs and harassment after participating in this sub, which I reported and sometimes that person was even permabanned only to create a brand new account to DM me again.

I've received dozens of snide incelly comments and DMs about Asian women now and it's always the same MRAsian weirdos.

Edit: For some reason I also have ""9 followers"" - who I assume are these dudes who keep messaging me."
5,vxju6d,"Completely off-topic, but replying with gifs in comments is now available in this sub.

![gif](giphy|3ohhweiVB36rAlqVCE|downsized)"
6,vxju6d,"I’m a bit concerned by the rhetoric and tone of this post. Oftentimes in this sub and elsewhere, concerns about “being kind” is used to dissuade views that might be inconvenient to certain stakeholders in liberal politics. I’ve noticed that anytime views antithetical to Asian liberal views like downplaying of anti Asian hate crimes or anti Asian racism from POC, this excuse is employed to kill what is otherwise an organic and naturally developed conversation.

This sub is one of the few spaces where intellectual discourse regarding Asian America can occur in a good faith manner, allowing us to dig deeper and have a deeper level of converse than is possible in white and other mainstream spaces. 

I don’t think that taking a “speak for yourself” approach is productive, given how this allows certain people to simply dismiss what are insightful and generalizable observations"
7,vxju6d,"I'm genuinely curious when you say ""we’ve opened up a lot more to discussions."" Assuming that it's monitored so it doesn't devolve into mindless, misogynistic bashing of Asian women: is the topic of the white male hegemony's effect on interracial relationships now open to discussion here? I personally think it's healthy for the broader Asian American community to fully confront this issue(s) - white male supremacy in all its forms, conscious and unconscious, and how it effects our biases socially, in our careers, in romance, in our worldviews, our actions, our mental health, our introspection, etc. - as long as the dialogue remains true to the topic and doesn't devolve into attacking individuals or each other.

I personally don't believe we can understand our racial identities in a genuine manner without deeply challenging the world we were indoctrinated/born into, and our places in it. We should take the time to be introspective in this regard, even when it's uncomfortable to do so.

Edit: I'll admit that I'm also coming in peace. As an update, the other sub also started cracking down on mindless bashing of Asian women, which I was very happy with (via the stickied post). Any step towards having constructive dialogues (and maybe even reconciling) is a plus. (Also, as a side note, I believe the whole Asian men vs. Asian women thing is a distraction when the real beef is between Asian Americans who white worship/self-hate vs. Asian Americans who don't.)"

0,wesg5o,"You are not the first. A friend of mine got hit by a white drunk truck driver, his car was demolished. My friend suid that driver and his company, but apparently police who dealt with this accident didn't even put the drunk part on file. Now the whole lawsuit thing is getting no where."
1,wesg5o,"File a complaint against the judge to your state's judicial committee. If the judge has had similar complaints made against them in the past, your complaint could help establish a pattern and lead to an investigation.

Sorry I'm not aware of any support groups to suggest though :(."
2,wesg5o,If he was racist you can always appeal the decision
3,wesg5o,Did the judge say anything discriminatory?  It’s very hard to win these cases but I’m sorry this happened to you.  Old white judges are often assholes and are often racist.  I see them intentionally delay hearings all the time saying they  “can’t understand their English” at the slightest sight of an accent
4,wesg5o,There is also the [southern poverty law center ](https://www.splcenter.org/what-we-do) to help with racial injustice.
5,wesg5o,Sorry to hear about your experience. I hope you find some peace soon!
6,wesg5o,Appeal the case up and seek help from [NAACP](https://www.naacpldf.org/contact-us/legal-assistance/) or [movement hub (AAPI)](https://movementhub.org/)
7,wesg5o,"What’s your evidence? You don’t have a case based on how you “felt” 

What was the evidence in the original case? Just because you lost doesn’t mean it was because you’re Asian"
8,wesg5o,"This happened too often to me. I own a remodeling business and scammers would contract me to do some work in the house, pay me upon completion (if not I will remove my work so they can't get it free), and one month later, suddenly alleging some minor defects they don't like, and take me to small claims court, demanding all money back plus additional fees. Despite our signed contract indicating ""no warrantee after we leave the house"", despite customer's signature indicating ""Satisfaction"" upon completion, despite pictures showing a perfect work and clearly claimants were making things up, judges always ruled against me, without any reason. So scammers can always get my products and work not only free, plus making extra money. Basically judges team up with scammers to rob me.

One of the scammers was a house flipper. After claiming that he hated my work and demanded for money back so he could pay some other company to redo the job, he got my money and put the house on the market. On Zillow I see all my original work in the house for sale. 

All the judges were white, and all the scammers were white. Only if we had Asian judges, thing would be different. That's why the only long-term solution for our plight is to increase our population. If we are no longer a minority our social status would be a lot better. That's why wife and I have 5 children and I always advocate for fellow Asians to do the same."
0,wfxs1q,I think you’re giving too much credit to the ignorant racist ass people using those slurs to be able to differentiate East Asians. To them we’re all the same.
1,wfxs1q,"In America, we’re all Chinese.  You believing how you do is assuming that racists know the difference between Asian nationalities.

Can you tell the difference between a black African from Sudan and one from Tanzania?  Likely not, but folks from those countries might be able to differentiate.  To everyone else, they’re just Africans."
2,wfxs1q,Asians get called chink everyday whether they’re Chinese or not. It’s possible for East and southeast Asians to live a universal truth while also having experiences specific to their ethnicity. I don’t think it’s worth the mental energy to get offended by this and gatekeep slurs. A lot of you in this sub need to lighten up or else we’re never going to achieve any sort of Asian solidarity in this country.
3,wfxs1q,"It’s not much different than the “N” word. Or the redneck, hillbillies. It’s all depends on person"
4,wfxs1q,"i used to internalize a bit of racist ideology when i was a stupid teenager due to all the racist slurs thrown at me from dealing with ignorant kids at school. the grown and mature part of me realizes that perpetuating racial slurs does not serve me nor my goals, and only ever causes further divides

words are just words - they are tools humans use to communicate. it's the intention behind them that really matters. i don't know who those people are to you, whether you would even consider them friends, but maybe it might be worth asking what their intentions are for using those slurs?

is it to minimize and reduce your native/heritage language and identity to a mere caricature? is it to belittle and disparage you? is it to get raise out of you - to trigger a viscerally emotional response from you?

it might not even be about you as a chinese person, but about them as a non-chinese asian person receiving and perpetuating the same sort of racism that were so casually thrown at them because they don't know how else to handle it; most people tend to perpetuate the traumas they've internalized onto others, whether conscious or not

if they aren't important people in your life, why should they have the power to affect you so much with their words? i would urge you to focus on bettering yourself and those in your life who do uplift you rather than expending anymore effort being concerned over the words of petty people 

if they are people you hope to keep in your life, maybe ask them some of these questions so you can both better understand where those words are actually coming from - perpetuating racism serves no one but the fascists that aim to marginalize and divide us further"
5,wfxs1q,"Had this Filipino girl mocked Chinese people while having Chinese food. It is funny cause she used to talk about how “‘white Asians’ think we are mutts but still eat our food”.

You have to deal with anti-Asian hate from white people, and anti-Chinese hate from other Asians"
6,wfxs1q,"I agree with you. I will sometimes say those c-slurs in their fullness when I’m calling out a racist act and want to add weight. But there are slurs specific to Korean people and Japanese people for example that I would never say in fullness out of respect, despite it could easily be said to me by a racist who doesn’t know the difference. That’s just me though. 

I see the argument. It’s a really long standing discourse in the LGBT community. A lot of gay men feel the same way about the f-slur. Some gay women get called it but does that mean they can say it? Is it their word to reclaim? A lot of gay men don’t think so.

It’s a touchy subject that doesn’t have easy answers. Ultimately, I don’t think anyone should say those slurs and if you must, you should be Chinese. That’s where I stand and feel in my gut."
7,wfxs1q,I personally think Chinese people are allowed to say it jokingly (i.e. oh man I woke up looking ch*nky this morning if my eyelids are puffy) but if you don’t have Chinese blood then I’m sorry but it’s not for you.
8,wfxs1q,"Yes, those slurs were originally targeted at Chinese people, just as the term Go\*k was originally aimed at Vietnamese and arose out of the Vietnam war.

But over time, racists have pretty much used all of terms interchangeably at anyone of Asian descent."
9,wfxs1q,"I found it offensive, arrogant and ignorant. I will cut ties with whomever say these things and find excuses even after I told them I feel offended. No matter what words/slurs we're used in a conversation, rule of thumb is, it's not ok to disrespect people and then tell them it's ok. It's NOT ok."
10,wfxs1q,"This is like that whole ""reclaiming the C-word"" nonsense months ago. It is extremely weird how some people project other people's struggles onto themselves. Don't they understand that they were never the target, just some collateral?"
11,wfxs1q,"It's certainly used against many Asians regardless of their background, but I disagree that it is appropriate for Asians of any background to turn around use it. Regardless of its (mis)application, it is a slur intended for those who have a Chinese background and as such is still damaging in that way even when used by other Asians."
12,wfxs1q,"I read it somewhere that the thing itself is not racist, but if it's done by someone with racist intention or within the context it is racist. 
For example, black people eating watermelon is racist in US, but if you offer someone black a piece of watermelon in Korea or China it's not racist cuz they don't know the context. Offer a Asian a watermelon is not racist. If black offer black watermelon is not racist. 
It's hard to judge, say a 3 year old did some gesture by accident, but they don't know the context it's not racist. 
I think it's important to look for the intension behind people's action."
