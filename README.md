# 100 Days of Data Projects

This is a daily goal where I will work on data projects for 100 days. The best projects at the end will be added to my portfolio.

Everyday I aim to do at least one of the following:

- Data cleaning and preperation

- Exploratory Data Analysis

- Machine Learning (supervised/unsupervised)

- Dashboard visualization

- Video presentation of analysis

This 100 days project is to practice data analysis, machine learning, creating dashboards, and communicating data insights.
